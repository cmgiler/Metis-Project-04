{"title": "Artificial intelligence poses risks of misuse by hackers, researchers say", "content": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Rapid advances in artificial intelligence are raising risks that malicious users will soon exploit the technology to mount automated hacking attacks, cause driverless car crashes or turn commercial drones into targeted weapons, a new report warns. The study, published on Wednesday by 25 technical and public policy researchers from Cambridge, Oxford and Yale universities along with privacy and military experts, sounded the alarm for the potential misuse of AI by rogue states, criminals and lone-wolf attackers. The researchers said the malicious use of AI poses imminent threats to digital, physical and political security by allowing for large-scale, finely targeted, highly efficient attacks. The study focuses on plausible developments within five years. \u201cWe all agree there are a lot of positive applications of AI,\u201d Miles Brundage, a research fellow at Oxford\u2019s Future of Humanity Institute. \u201cThere was a gap in the literature around the issue of malicious use.\u201d Artificial intelligence, or AI, involves using computers to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as taking decisions or recognizing text, speech or visual images. It is considered a powerful force for unlocking all manner of technical possibilities but has become a focus of strident debate over whether the massive automation it enables could result in widespread unemployment and other social dislocations. The 98-page paper cautions that the cost of attacks may be lowered by the use of AI to complete tasks that would otherwise require human labor and expertise. New attacks may arise that would be impractical for humans alone to develop or which exploit the vulnerabilities of AI systems themselves. It reviews a growing body of academic research about the security risks posed by AI and calls on governments and policy and technical experts to collaborate and defuse these dangers. The researchers detail the power of AI to generate synthetic images, text and audio to impersonate others online, in order to sway public opinion, noting the threat that authoritarian regimes could deploy such technology. The report makes a series of recommendations including regulating AI as a dual-use military/commercial technology. It also asks questions about whether academics and others should rein in what they publish or disclose about new developments in AI until other experts in the field have a chance to study and react to potential dangers they might pose. \u201cWe ultimately ended up with a lot more questions than answers,\u201d Brundage said. The paper was born of a workshop in early 2017, and some of its predictions essentially came true while it was being written. The authors speculated AI could be used to create highly realistic fake audio and video of public officials for propaganda purposes. Late last year, so-called \u201cdeepfake\u201d pornographic videos began to surface online, with celebrity faces realistically melded to different bodies. \u201cIt happened in the regime of pornography rather than propaganda,\u201d said Jack Clark, head of policy at OpenAI, the group founded by Tesla Inc ( ) CEO Elon Musk and Silicon Valley investor Sam Altman to focus on friendly AI that benefits humanity. \u201cBut nothing about deepfakes suggests it can\u2019t be applied to propaganda.\u201d", "date": "February 21, 2018", "author": "Eric Auchard"},
{"title": "Temenos agrees 1.4 billion pounds deal for Fidessa, activist Elliott enters", "content": "ZURICH (Reuters) - Temenos agreed a 1.4 billion pound ($1.96 billion) takeover of British software peer Fidessa Group on Wednesday, whose shares traded above the offer price after activist investor Elliott Capital Advisors disclosed a stake. The two companies announced advanced takeover talks a day earlier as Swiss Temenos looked to add Fidessa\u2019s equities trading technology to expand its customer base in the financial services industry. Fidessa shareholders would get 35.67 pounds for each share in the all-cash deal, expected to be completed in the first half of 2018. The British company\u2019s investors will also get a combined final and special dividend of 79.7 pence for 2017. The price represented a premium of roughly 36.9 percent on Fidessa\u2019s opening price of 26.05 pounds per share on Feb. 16. Temenos shares slipped 0.6 percent by 1045 GMT, while Fidessa\u2019s stock hit a high of 37.45 pounds before easing to 36.85 pounds. As Temenos is proposing to buy Fidessa by way of a scheme of arrangement, Fidessa needs the backing of 75 percent of its shareholders for the deal to go through. Activist investor Elliott Capital Advisors disclosed a 4.8715 percent stake in Fidessa on Wednesday. It declined to comment on its intentions. Elliott has become active in Britain and has used its involvement in takeover targets to extract a higher price from buyers. It was among investment firms that forced Belgium-based brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev to raise its offer for rival beer business SABMiller in 2016, a $110 billion deal that was the UK\u2019s biggest corporate takeover. It also has the equivalent of 7.1 percent in NXP Semiconductors [NXPSM.UL], which was the subject of a sweetened $44 billion offer from U.S. peer Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday in exchange for agreements from nine NXP stockholders, including Elliott. Temenos said it is borrowing up to 1.43 billion pounds to pay for its biggest ever acquisition and would later raise cash on the capital markets to reduce its debt. It declined to comment on the size of the capital raising.  Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Andreas Mueller estimated it could look to raise $400 million to $450 million. The deal \u201cwill accelerate both companies\u2019 complementary growth strategies in banking and capital markets and will enable us to cross-sell into our existing client bases and capture a greater share of the IT and software spend of banks especially as they move to the cloud\u201d, Temenos Chairman Andreas Andreades said in a statement. The enlarged company would have had revenues of more than $1.2 billion in 2017, and a core profit margin of 32.3 percent, which Temenos said it expected to increase to 37 percent after annual savings of $60 million were achieved. Temenos said it expected the deal to be earnings accretive in 2018, and boost earnings per share in the mid-teen percentage range from 2019 onwards. Andreades said software in the capital markets industry was  highly fragmented and dominated by older systems, creating an opportunity for the combined company\u2019s offering. Financial institutions spent an estimated $14 billion on capital markets software in 2018, with $3 billion going to third party vendors like Temenos. Such total spend is expected to grow by 8 percent per year, the company said. \u201cThe synergies, which are higher than we expected, and the increase in sales and increase in adjusted earnings from the first year are positive aspects,\u201d said ZKB\u2019s Mueller. \u201cThe industrial logic is clear. Many banks in Asia and Europe are offering a trading business in addition to retail and asset management, which gives clear cross selling potential,\u201d he added.", "date": "February 21, 2018", "author": "John Revill"},

{"title": "Avis steers into crowded field for managing ride services fleets", "content": "DETROIT (Reuters) - When Avis Budget Group Inc ( ) reports its results on Wednesday, executives under pressure from restive shareholders will likely point to the potential for profits from managing fleets of vehicles for ride services and robo-taxi companies. Avis, however, won\u2019t be alone in chasing revenue from the same ride service companies that are undermining the rental car business. Fleet management is a catch-all term for a complex suite of services ranging from financing car purchases to maintaining, cleaning, fuelling, repairing and selling used vehicles. Fleet managers use real-time data to track vehicles for customers like Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Lyft and General Motors Co\u2019s ( ) Maven to maximum vehicle usage and cut down on the downtime that leads to lost revenue on expensive assets. \u201cSaying \u2018I want to go into fleet management\u2019 is easy,\u201d said Hans-Werner Kaas, a senior partner at McKinsey & Company\u2019s Detroit office. \u201cBut fleet management is very capital-intensive and is different from what many of those companies do today.\u201d Even Element Fleet Management Corp ( ), an established fleet manager, has stumbled recently with an expensive, complex big-data platform deployed to manage large vehicle fleets. Element manages more than 1 million vehicles for corporate customers and spent $70 million on a big-data driven platform for customers using artificial intelligence and predictive analytics. But the system\u2019s glitches cost Element\u2019s former chief executive his job and helped send the company\u2019s shares down more than 50 percent this year. Element said it is fixing the problems and will spend $35 million more in 2018 on product enhancements. \u201cThe bumps we\u2019ve had in rolling out a new platform is indicative of the complexity of pivoting to new transportation models that are still being invented,\u201d said Michele Cunningham, Element\u2019s senior vice president for products and services. Years of heavy U.S. automobile sales have depressed used car values, hurting Avis and others that depend on selling vehicles into the secondary market. Avis is trying to beef up prices but said last month that \u201cunexpected pricing and fleet cost challenges\u201d have cost it $300 million over the last two years. It expects to post 2017 adjusted pre-tax income nearly 13 percent lower than in 2016. The company\u2019s largest shareholder, SRS Investment Management LLC, has proposed three new nominees for Avis\u2019 board and said it must formulate \u201ctop strategic priorities\u201d to confront a present threat from Uber and Lyft, and a future threat from robo-taxi operators such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s ( ) Waymo or GM\u2019s Cruise. Avis owns ride-sharing service Zipcar, which rents cars to Uber drivers, and last June announced a service agreement for Waymo\u2019s self-driving car fleet starting in Phoenix, sending its shares soaring. Avis is testing a fleet of connected cars in Kansas City to build fleet management expertise and \u201cto see how we can do this for others as well,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Larry De Shon said. Stanford economist Tony Seba and tech investor James Arbib estimate that self-driving cars in \"transportation-as-a-service\" will grow from zero U.S. passenger miles in 2020 versus traditionally-owned vehicles to 95 percent of the 6.1 trillion passenger miles in 2030. (For a graphic, see: ) The fleets required for those services mean \u201ca lot of money on the table\u201d for fleet managers, said Doug Mehl, a partner in A.T. Kearney\u2019s automotive practice. That potential is drawing a crowd. Avis rivals Hertz Global Holdings Inc ( ) and Enterprise Holdings Inc ERACR.UL are staking out positions in fleet management, as are car auction giants Manheim and KAR Auction Services Inc ( ), which already have facilities to handle millions of used vehicles annually. KAR said this month it was buying fleet management software company STRATIM to enter the business. Manheim is talking to partners about larger fleets and expects to invest in new facilities in the next three years as demand grows, said Grace Huang, president of inventory solutions at Cox Automotive, Manheim\u2019s parent company. Car dealers want in as well. AutoNation Inc ( ) last November signed a service agreement with Waymo, a deal that boosted its shares. \u201cDealers are a natural fit,\u201d National Automobile Dealers Association spokesman Jonathan Collegio said. \u201cBecause they\u2019re everywhere, they\u2019ve already made the investments and have the expertise.\u201d", "date": "February 21, 2018", "author": "Nick Carey"},
{"title": "Venezuela says launch of 'petro' cryptocurrency raised $735 million", "content": "CARACAS (Reuters) - President Nicolas Maduro said Tuesday that Venezuela had received $735 million in the first day of a pre-sale of the country\u2019s \u201cpetro\u201d cryptocurrency, aimed at pulling the country out of an economic tailspin. Maduro is hoping the petro will allow the ailing OPEC member to skirt U.S. sanctions as the bolivar currency plunges to record lows and it struggles with hyperinflation and a collapsing socialist economy. Blockchain experts have warned the petro is unlikely to attract significant investment. Opposition leaders have said the sale constitutes an illegal debt issuance that circumvents Venezuela\u2019s majority-opposition legislature, and the U.S. Treasury Department has warned it may violate sanctions levied last year. Maduro did not give details about the initial investors and there was no evidence presented for his figure. He added that tourism, some gasoline sales and some oil transactions could be made in petro. \u201cToday, a cryptocurrency is being born that can take on Superman,\u201d said Maduro, using the comic character to refer to the United States, as he was flanked by mining rigs in a state television address. The official website for the petro on Tuesday published a guide to setting up a virtual wallet to hold the cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency goes public next month. Venezuelan Cryptocurrency Superintendent Carlos Vargas last week said the government was expecting to draw investment from investors in Turkey, Qatar, the United States and Europe. The value of the entire petro issuance of 100 million tokens would be just over $6 billion, according to details given by Maduro in recent months, though no new price information was provided on Tuesday. The tokens will each be valued at and backed by a barrel of Venezuelan crude oil, Maduro has said. Advisers working for the government have in the past recommended that 38.4 percent of the petros should be sold in a private auction at a discount of 60 percent. Maduro says his government is the victim of an \u201ceconomic war\u201d led by opposition politicians with the help of the government of U.S. President Donald Trump. Sanctions levied last year by Washington block U.S. banks and investors from acquiring newly issued Venezuelan debt, effectively preventing the nation from borrowing abroad to bring in new hard currency or refinance existing debt.

{"title": "Human rights groups say Mexico not investigating spyware claims", "content": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A group of human and digital rights activists said on Tuesday that the Mexican government had failed to properly investigate allegations their smartphones were infected with spying software. They have asked for an independent investigation. Activists, human-rights lawyers and journalists filed a complaint in June with the attorney general\u2019s office, claiming the government had infected their phones to spy on them with software known as Pegasus, which Israeli company NSO Group allegedly sold to Mexico\u2019s government. \u201cSince filing the complaint we said we did not trust the attorney general\u2019s office would be able to investigate itself, since there is evidence it was that agency that purchased the malware,\u201d the activist groups said in a joint statement.

{"title": "Bitcoins for free? Japanese cryptocurrency exchange lands in hot water again", "content": "TOKYO (Reuters) - A blunder at a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange let investors briefly buy bitcoins for free - though none were able to profit from the mistake. Zaif, a government-registered exchange run by Osaka-based Tech Bureau Corp, said on Tuesday that a system glitch had let seven customers buy bitcoin with no yen value during a 20-minute window last week. The exchange voided the trades after discovering the error, which happened on Feb. 16 - though it was still trying to resolve the issue with one customer who tried to transfer the knock-down bitcoins from the exchange, a spokesman told Reuters. Zaif\u2019s operator had already faced checks after last month\u2019s theft of $530 million in digital money from Coincheck Inc, with regulators fearing its systems were at risk from cyber-attacks. The latest flub could draw further attention to security and systems at cryptocurrency exchanges, which were already under scrutiny in the wake of the Coincheck heist. The theft also drew into question Japan\u2019s system of overseeing exchanges. Zaif is one of 16 exchanges registered with the government, which last year allowed a further 16 - including Coincheck - to continue operating pending full registration. The registered exchanges will form a self-regulatory body from April, sources have told Reuters. They had originally planned to merge two existing industry bodies representing both registered and unregistered exchanges. The body will set out rules on issues like exchange security and advertising, and will lay out penalties for members who don\u2019t follow the policies, the Nikkei business daily reported on Wednesday. Japan last year rolled out the world\u2019s first system to oversee cryptocurrency exchanges, in a bid to protect customers and stamp out illegal uses of cryptocurrencies as it sought to  nurture a young and promising sector. The regulator opted for relatively loose rules to help nurture the industry, mostly populated by start-ups. The Coincheck heist exposed flaws in the system, and - for some experts - raised questions over Japan\u2019s dash to regulate the industry amid crackdowns by countries from China to India.

Locking in cobalt supplies has become a dominant theme as it is also used in batteries to power electric vehicles whose rapid growth is revolutionizing the motor industry, which is also looking to agree long-term supply deals. Auto makers, mobile device makers and manufacturers of super-alloys used to make jet engines are all getting jittery about possible scarcities of responsibly sourced cobalt, sources said. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure whether (Apple) want to buy the cobalt for the battery makers that supply them or whether they are planning to stand behind the cobalt supply chain as guarantors,\u201d a cobalt industry source said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been asking producers to make offers. We\u2019re not sure of the volumes, but if they are looking for anything more than a couple of years, they might be disappointed.\u201d A Bloomberg report, citing an anonymous source, said the iPhone maker was seeking contracts to buy several thousand metric tonnes of cobalt for five years or longer. Industry sources said Apple had spoken to miners such as Glencore ( ), a top producer, which said late last year it would produce around 39,000 tonnes of cobalt this year. Asked on a results call with reporters on Wednesday about the company\u2019s relationship with Apple, Glencore\u2019s Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg said: \u201cWe have not signed any deals,\u201d adding that Glencore would not sign any long-term deals because the company did not want to lock in cobalt prices. Talking to reporters in London last December, Glasenberg said the company had held talks with Apple, Tesla ( ) and Volkswagen ( ) as part of ongoing discussions with industrial clients. Sources told Reuters last year that Germany\u2019s Volkswagen had asked producers to submit proposals on supplying cobalt for up to 10 years from 2019. Cobalt CBD0 prices on the London Metal Exchange, at around $80,000 a tonne, have climbed from near $20,000 in January 2016. Global demand this year is estimated at more than 110,000 tonnes, of which more than 65 percent is expected to come from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it is a byproduct of copper production.

The guidance also said company executives must not trade in a firm\u2019s securities while possessing nonpublic information on  cyber security attacks. The SEC encouraged companies to consider adopting specific policies restricting executive trading in shares while a hack is being investigated and before it is disclosed. The SEC, in unanimously approving the additional guidance, said it would promote \u201cclearer and more robust disclosure\u201d by companies facing cyber security issues, according to SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, a Republican. Democrats on the commission reluctantly supported the guidance, describing it as a paltry step taken in the wake of a raft of high-profile hacks at major companies that exposed millions of Americans\u2019 personal information. They called for much more rigorous rulemaking to police disclosure around cyber security issues, or requiring certain cyber security policies at public companies. Commissioner Robert Jackson said the new document \u201cessentially reiterates years-old staff-level views on this issue,\u201d and pointed to analysis from the White House Council of Economic Advisers that finds companies frequently under-report cyber security events to investors. The SEC first issued guidance in 2011 on cyber security disclosures. \u201cIt may provide investors a false sense of comfort that we, at the Commission, have done something more than we have,\u201d  Commissioner Kara Stein, another Democrat, said in a statement.

The new guidance will mean that corporations disclose more information about cyber attacks and risks and take steps to ensure no insider trading can occur around those events, said several attorneys who advise businesses on the subject. \u201cThis essentially creates a mandatory new disclosure category - cyber security risks and incidents,\u201d said Spencer Feldman, an attorney with Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP. Craig A. Newman, a partner with Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler LLP said the SEC guidance \u201cmakes clear that it doesn\u2019t want a repeat of the Equifax situation.\u201d", "date": "February 21, 2018", "author": "Pete Schroeder, Jim Finkle"},

{"title": "Americans prefer bank branches over mobile apps for opening new accounts", "content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mobile banking apps keep getting better, but 60 percent of Americans would still rather open a new checking account in person at a bank branch than on a phone, tablet or desktop computer, according to a new survey. Set for release on Wednesday by consulting firm Novantas, the survey also found that half of U.S. customers feel that online-only banks are \u201cless legitimate\u201d than those with branches. The preference for visits to branch offices over online banking for some activity stems from being able to see someone to resolve any issues that may arise, the researchers found. \u201cFolks are still hanging onto this comfort of feeling like there is a branch nearby if, and when, they need it,\u201d said Matthew Sharp of Novantas. Never mind that they are going to branches less often. The findings show that banks that can afford to keep branch offices still have an advantage over online upstarts when  signing new customers for primary accounts. The results help explain why JPMorgan Chase & Co ( ) and Bank of America Corp ( ) have said recently they will build branches as they spread into more cities. Bank of America is expanding this year into Pittsburgh. JPMorgan intends to add as many as 400 branches over five years as it moves into cities such as Boston and Washington, D.C. The Novantas findings are based on responses from 4,352 people contacted by email in September. More U.S. customers might be willing to open primary accounts online if traditional banks were able to better show that they can handle problems remotely, Sharp said. But some banks still will not even change a home address for a customer without a personal visit, said Andrew Hovet, a director at Novantas. Firms that are newer to taking bank consumer deposits, such as Ally Financial Inc ( ) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc  ( ), have had an advantage in being able to design easy-to-use online accounts from the start, Hovet said. So far online-only firms have mostly signed customers seeking the highest deposit rates for secondary savings accounts, not people setting up primary transaction accounts to anchor their finances, Hovet said. Still, because Americans, and particularly younger adults, are doing more everyday transactions by phone, JPMorgan and Bank of America can build fewer traditional branches in new territories than would have been needed in the past. They can open smaller branches, space them further apart and supplement their presence with more ATM kiosks, local marketing and advertising. Done right, they can win, for example, 10 percent of new checking account customers in a market in which they have only 5 percent of the branches, Hovet said.", "date": "February 21, 2018", "author": "David Henry"},
{"title": "Broadcom cuts Qualcomm offer to $117 billion after new NXP deal", "content": "(Reuters) - Microchip maker Broadcom Ltd ( ) cut its bid for Qualcomm Inc ( ) on Wednesday by 4 percent to $117 billion as it objected to Qualcomm\u2019s decision to raise its own bid for NXP Semiconductors NV ( ) to $44 billion. Qualcomm responded that Broadcom had made \u201can inadequate offer even worse,\u201d setting up a showdown on March 6, when Qualcomm shareholders are scheduled to elect an 11-member board and decide whether to hand control to a slate of six nominees put forward by Broadcom. A tie-up between Broadcom and Qualcomm would be the biggest technology acquisition ever. The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc ( ) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( ) use their market dominance to negotiate lower chip prices. Broadcom said that Qualcomm\u2019s raised bid would amount to overpaying for NXP and cut its own bid as a result. \u201cQualcomm\u2019s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders,\u201d Broadcom said in its statement on Wednesday. The moves raise the chances that Qualcomm will buy NXP and lowered the chances of a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, CFRA Research analyst Scott Kessler wrote. Broadcom also criticized Qualcomm on Wednesday for not liaising with it before raising its NXP bid, as proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc had recommended. Qualcomm on Wednesday defended the value of the NXP deal, which it argued would expand Qualcomm\u2019s markets and offer cost savings, and said Broadcom had refused to engage in discussions on the value of Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm. The deal with Broadcom continued to face a \u201chighly uncertain path to regulatory approvals,\u201d Qualcomm added. Qualcomm shares were trading down 0.5 percent at $63.53 on Wednesday afternoon in New York, while Broadcom shares were up 1.2 percent at $252.69. Qualcomm raised its offer for NXP from $110 to $127.50 per share in cash on Tuesday. In exchange, it received binding agreements from nine NXP stockholders that collectively own more than 28 percent of NXP\u2019s outstanding shares to support the deal. These include hedge funds Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd and Soroban Capital Partners LP, which had pushed for a higher price. Broadcom\u2019s latest $82 per share cash-and-stock offer for Qualcomm was contingent on it buying NXP at its earlier offered price of $110 per share. Broadcom said on Wednesday that if the NXP deal goes ahead at $127.50, it will reduce the cash portion of its bid for Qualcomm by $3 per share. Qualcomm is contractually obligated to complete the NXP deal, so that acquisition could fall apart only if too few NXP shareholders support the tender offer or if China\u2019s MOFCOM, the only relevant regulator that has yet to approve the deal, blocks it. Under the new terms agreed with NXP\u2019s board, the deal with Qualcomm is contingent on 70 percent of NXP\u2019s shares being tendered, instead of the 80 percent threshold required in the earlier agreement signed in October 2016. Once this threshold is reached, Qualcomm can take over the entire company through a \u201csecond-step\u201d transaction mechanism. NXP shares were trading at $125.70 on Wednesday, close to the new deal price, indicating that most investors think the acquisition will go through. Broadcom said on Wednesday other conditions of the proposed merger agreement remained unchanged, including an $8 billion breakup fee to be paid to Qualcomm should regulators thwart the deal.", "date": "February 21, 2018", "author": "Greg Roumeliotis"},
{"title": "U.S. cloud-computing failure could spur up to $19 billion in losses: Lloyd's", "content": "(Reuters) - A cyber problem that temporary shuts down a top U.S. cloud computing provider could trigger as much as $19 billion in business losses, only a fraction of which would be insured, Lloyd\u2019s of London said in a report on Tuesday. The report, co-written with modeling firm AIR Worldwide, examined potential losses stemming from disruptions to business that depend on cloud computing in the event that cyber incidents such as hacking, lightning strikes, bombing of data centers and human errors \u201ccompletely disrupt\u201d U.S. cloud service to all of a provider\u2019s customers. An incident that takes one of the top-three cloud service providers offline for three to six days would result in total losses of between $5.3 billion and $19 billion. Insured losses would total between $1.1 billion and $3.5 billion, according to the Lloyd\u2018s-AIR report. Cloud computing has grown rapidly in recent years as businesses move their operations to public clouds,\u00a0the big computer data centers that are displacing traditional customer-owned computer systems. The Lloyd\u2019s report, based on scenarios involving the top 15 U.S. cloud providers, does not identify those providers.  A spokeswoman for Lloyd\u2018s, the world\u2019s largest specialty insurance market, declined comment. Research firm Canalys estimates the cloud computing market at $14.4 billion for the third quarter of 2017, up 43 percent from a year prior. Amazon.com Inc holds 31.8 percent of the market, followed by Microsoft Corp at 13.9 percent and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google with 6 percent, according to Canalys\u2019 estimates. \u201cI think the world is much more correlated,\u201d than it was before, Lloyd\u2019s of London Chief Executive Inga Beale said in an interview. \u201cOther things can impact and aggregate with a cyber security issue.\u201d A cloud failure can disrupt orders for Web-based businesses, shipping, email, payments and more. Insurers are struggling to estimate their potential exposure to cyber-related losses amid mounting cyber risks and interest in cyber insurance. \u201cAs the cyber insurance market grows rapidly, the distribution of risk will have to be monitored carefully,\u201d Lloyd\u2019s said in the report. A cyber incident that knocks out one of the 10th- to 15th-largest U.S. cloud providers for three to six days would cause $300 million and $1.5 billion in losses and between $40 million and $300 million in losses to the insurance industry. Smaller companies may rely more on the cloud than larger companies and are less likely to have cyber insurance, according to the report.", "date": "January 23, 2018", "author": "Suzanne Barlyn"},

Jiaqiang Xu, 32, was sentenced on Thursday by U.S. District Judge Kenneth Karas in White Plains, New York, according to a statement from the office of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman. Xu pleaded guilty in May 2017 to economic espionage and theft of a trade secret. Leanne Marek, Xu\u2019s attorney, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Xu worked as a systems software developer for International Business Machines Corp from 2010 to 2014, according to a public LinkedIn profile. The company was not identified by name in court documents, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Xu was arrested in December 2015 after meeting with an undercover officer at a White Plains hotel, where authorities said he was recorded saying he used proprietary IBM code to make software to sell to customers, according to prosecutors. He was originally charged with theft of a trade secret. The economic espionage charges were added in a superseding indictment filed last June. Prosecutors said the proprietary computer code Xu stole was related to a so-called clustered file system, which facilitates faster computer performance. Xu, who began working at IBM in China in 2010, had full access to the source code before voluntarily resigning in May 2014, prosecutors said. According to the criminal complaint filed in 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2014 received a report that someone in China was claiming to have access to the code and using it for business ventures, prompting the investigation that led to the arrest.", "date": "January 19, 2018", "author": "Brendan Pierson"},

The law renews for six years and with minimal changes the National Security Agency (NSA) program, which gathers information from foreigners overseas but incidentally collects an unknown amount of communications belonging to Americans. The measure easily passed the U.S. House of Representatives last week despite mixed signals posted on Twitter by Trump and narrowly avoided a filibuster in the Senate earlier this week that split party lines. The measure had drawn opposition from a coalition of privacy-minded Democrats and libertarian Republicans. In his tweet on Friday, Trump attempted to clarify why he signed the bill despite repeating an unsubstantiated claim that his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, ordered intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on Trump\u2019s 2016 Republican presidential campaign. \u201cThis is NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cI will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the American people first!\u201d Last September, the U.S. Justice Department said in a court filing that it had no evidence to support Trump\u2019s claim about improper surveillance during the campaign. Without Trump\u2019s signature, Section 702 had been set to expire on Friday, though intelligence officials had said the surveillance program could continue to operate until April. Under the law, the NSA is allowed to eavesdrop on vast amounts of digital communications from foreigners living outside the United States via U.S. companies like Facebook Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google. But the program also incidentally scoops up Americans\u2019 communications, including when they communicate with a foreign target living overseas, and can search those messages without a warrant. The White House, U.S. intelligence agencies and congressional Republican leaders have said the program is indispensable to national security, vital to protecting U.S. allies and needs little or no revision.

The company said it would email 677,775 people in the United States who followed, retweeted or liked content from accounts associated with the Internet Research Agency (IRA) during the election. The IRA is a Russian organization that according to lawmakers and researchers, employs hundreds of people to push pro-Kremlin content under phony social media accounts. Twitter added that because it has already suspended these accounts, the relevant content is no longer publicly available on its platform. Twitter executives on Wednesday told U.S. lawmakers that it may notify the users about the Russian propaganda. The company in September said it had suspended about 200 Russian-linked accounts, and followed it by suspending adverts from media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik in October.

{"title": "Contrite Facebook executives seek to ward off more European rules", "content": "MUNICH (Reuters) - Facebook executives are fanning out across Europe this week to address the social media giant\u2019s slow response to abuses on its platform, seeking to avoid further legislation along the lines of a new hate speech law in Germany it says goes too far. Facebook\u2019s communications and public policy chief used an annual meeting in Munich of some of Europe and Silicon Valley\u2019s tech elite to apologize for failing to do more, earlier, to fight hate speech and foreign influence campaigns on Facebook. \u201cWe have to demonstrate we can bring people together and build stronger communities,\u201d the executive, Elliot Schrage, said of the world\u2019s biggest information-sharing platform, which has more than 2 billion monthly users. \u201cWe have over-invested in building new experiences and under-invested in preventing abuses,\u201d he said in a keynote speech at the DLD Munich conference on Sunday. In the United States, lawmakers have criticized Facebook for failing to stop Russian operatives using its platform to meddle in the 2016 presidential elections, while Britain\u2019s parliament is looking again at the role such manipulation may have played in Britain\u2019s Brexit vote to leave the European Union. ( ) (( ) A German law that took effect at the start of the year requires social networks such as Facebook, Google and Twitter to remove online hate speech or face heavy fines. ( ) \u201cIt sets forth the right idea for the relation between government and the private sector but it also goes farther than ... we think it should go,\u201d Schrage said of the law. \u201dAt the same time the law places the responsibility on us to be judge and jury and enforcer determining what is legally compliant and not.\u00a0I think that is a bad idea. \u201cThe challenge is how to define where the violation has been or not,\u201d he said. By contrast, Schrage praised the approach of the European Union in demanding that internet companies adhere to a code of conduct and respond quickly to requests to take down illegal content rather than being required to make those decisions themselves. \u201cThat\u2019s an example of how we can work with governments to be more responsive to their concerns,\u201d Schrage said of the EU. The EU has put internet companies on notice that it will legislate if they don't do a better job self-policing their services for extremist propaganda, hate speech and other abuses. ( ) Far from being a \u201cWild West of content\u201d, Schrage argued,  Facebook\u2019s policies on policing content are far more in line with Europe\u2019s strict boundaries governing hate speech than the  anything-goes reputation it has coming from Silicon Valley. \u201cWe are often criticised for being an American company. But our policies with respect to speech and expression are much closer to how the standards have evolved in Europe than they are in the United States,\u201d Schrage said. \u201cWe do not permit hate speech, we do not permit incitement. There is a tremendous amount of content we remove regularly. When we see content related to terrorism, to hate speech, to incitement, we reach out to law enforcement,\u201d he said. But several tech leaders in the audience said Facebook had long ignored what are effectively editorial responsibilities for policing abusive content on its platform. Schrage said Facebook now employed thousands of people to monitor content and to work more closely with law enforcement, while automated algorithms detect and delete 99 percent of Islamic State and al Qaeda content before any Facebook users ever see it. Paul-Bernhard Kallen, chief executive of Hubert Burda Media, one of Germany\u2019s largest publishers, said Facebook has avoided responsibility for moderating content on its platform. \u201cFrom my perspective, Facebook is a media company.

Facebook\u2019s move comes as EU states discuss proposals to raise the tax bill of tech multinationals after pressure from large states that accuse firms like Amazon ( ), Google ( ), Apple ( ) and Facebook of slashing their tax bills by re-routing their EU profits to low-tax countries such as Luxembourg and Ireland. Smaller EU countries, like Luxembourg or Malta, argue that a solo EU move on corporate tax reform would damage its economy and favor competitors.
