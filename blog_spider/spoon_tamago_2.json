But for Japanese artist Yusuke Aonuma , single dandelion fluff, the feathery, umbrella-like structure that carries the seed to faraway lands, captivated his creative mind. Aonuma begins by harvesting the dandelions ( , in Japanese) and drying them, thereby creating an abundant supply for him to work with. He then “plants” them upright in acrylic slabs to form three-dimensional geometric and architectural shapes. Over 50 different slabs were on display recently at an exhibition in Tokyo, a show that Aonuma titled “Iki wo tateru” (息を立てる), which roughly translates as “to breath.” Aonuma encouraged visitors to gently breath on the dandelion fluff sculptures as a way of visualizing that they were real and standing upright. Although Aonuma’s exhibition has since closed, the artist has announced an upcoming exhibition in March of 2018, which will take place in the Omotesando district of Tokyo. The exact location and dates have yet to be revealed.

Each winter, as temperatures fall and tourists begin to dwindle, Matsui’s artwork becomes a beacon of light that encourages visitors to travel out to his neck of the woods to see his waterfall of ice. Titled “ ,” which is the Japanese word for wateralls that have frozen over, Matsui created the structure with the help of his entire family. It’s made from a complex wooden latticed structure that was built on a sloping hill on Matsui’s property. Using his vocational training in plumbing, Matsui built an irrigation system that carries water from a nearby ravine, then branches out to spray the entire wooden structure with water, which freezes over to create large icicles. When completed, both its width and height measure about 20 m (65 ft) and it appears like a treacherous frozen waterfall. Originally created in 2011, Matsui & sons improve on the structure each year, making it slightly bigger than the last. In 2012 they installed LED lights to illuminate the ice in the evening, which has proven popular for visitors. According to the local tourism association, the waterfall attracted 3500 people last year.

So it’s not surprising that much of his work takes after the nostalgic, 8-bit aesthetic of pixelated bumpiness. One of his latest creations is this series of adorable mini-puppies based on his iconic exploration of three-dimensional 8-bit sculptures. The process is one of distillation and discovery: removing information to bring into focus the most important elements. Each puppy is a wooden block sculpture that has been hand-cast in resin. And they’re available in fun, vibrant shades of blue, yellow, white, pink and green. Each color is a limited edition of 100 and is a collector’s item for art and dog lovers alike.

For better or for worse, green tea is no longer considered an old person’s beverage. It’s hip, it’s healthy and it’s everywhere. Cafes in Japan (and all over the world, for that matter) have been the first to capitalize on this trend. Take for example, San Grams , which opened in 2016, and then the world’s first hand-dripped tea café , which opened in 2017. This year, Tokyo will see two different green tea-inspired hotels opening in Tokyo. Opening in February 9th, 2018 and located in Shibuya is Hotel Koe . Meaning “voice” in Japanese, Hotel Koe is meant to create a link between Japanese culture – fashion, urban design and food – and project that voice into the world in the form of a hotel. It’s designed by Makoto Tanijiri and Ai Yoshida , who explain that their “design aims to make use of the medium of the hotel to rethink our links with the streets, our links with food, clothing and shelter, and to offer new experiences.” Branding and signage is the work of art director Shun Kawakami . The 1st floor houses a bakery/restaurant, as well as ‘koé space,’ where art, music and other special events are held. The 2nd floor features an apparel shop where you’ll find limited-edition items created in collaboration with designers and illustrators. The entire complex comprises a hotel-in-shop experience. The 3rd floor and up is where you’ll find the accommodations, and is where the designers drew inspiration from Japan’s tea ceremony. The rooms give a modern twist to the elements of the “chashitsu,” or tea rooms, and incorporate features like an engawa, a non-tatami porch. Opening later this year on December 1, 2018 is Hotel 1899 . The new hotel will be owned and operated by the Ryumeikan Hotel , and represents their first new acquisition of land in roughly 100 years. The hotel does operate a restaurant in Tokyo – the 1899 Restaurant Ochanomizu – and both borrow their name from the date that the original hotel was established. The new Hotel 1899 is being designed by Gensler’s Tokyo Office , who have been responsible for a large number of corporate offices in Tokyo like Netflix, Facebook, Pfizer and Booking.com. The entire Hotel 1899 is being envisioned as a modern take on Japan’s tea culture that “delivers the liveliness of people gathering and interacting and a quietness that is removed from the noise of the city, together with the tea culture of japan.” A total of 63 rooms will occupy floors 3 through 9. Below them, guests will be able to enjoy green tea at a special café, as well as other green tea-inspired creations like green tea beer!","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["green tea","tokyo guide","tokyo guide relax"],"date":"February 7, 2018"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Photographs of Transparent Acrylic Perfectly Sandwiched Between Stacked Stones","content":"Born in 1989, Takuma Sato is a Japanese photographer who studied architecture in school.

One of his most eye-capturing, thought-provoking and just overall satisfying series is WYSASSS . The acronym stands for – you’ll never guess so don’t try – “When You See the Acrylic to See a Stone a Stone.” To create his enigmatic portraits, Sato placed a piece of acrylic in between two stones and photographed them at the perfect angle so that the acrylic is rendered nearly invisible and the top stone appears to levitate.

Wood has been thought of as structurally unsafe, susceptible to rotting, and flammable. But thanks to advances in technology that has enabled the engineering of mega-strong, fire-resistant timber, wood is now slowly returning to urban settings. And Japan is raising the bar – quite literally – when it comes to using wood to construct skyscrapers. Japanese builder and developer Sumitomo Forestry has teamed up with architecture firm Nikken Sekkei to construct a 350-meter (1148 ft) wooden skyscraper in Tokyo’s Marunouchi district right around Tokyo Station. Although still in conceptual stages, the company is aiming to complete “W350” by 2041, a date that would mark the 350th anniversary of the company. If completed, it would be the world’s tallest wooden structure and would even beat out Japan Abeno Harukas (300 meters) in Osaka, which currently holds the record of tallest building in Japan. Using a hybrid 9:1 ratio of wood to steel, Sumitomo Forestry aims to replace concrete, which is one of the world’s largest carbon footprint contributors. The skyscraper would be a 70-floor mixed-use building that would include a hotel, office space, commercial space and residences. Wrap-around balconies at different intervals would be planted with lush wildlife. And greenery would extend throughout the entire complex, creating a vertical forest where humans and wildlife can flourish. As David Attenborough optimistically said in the final installment of Planet Earth II, “we are the designers of this environment. How, and whether we decide to invite the wildlife back, is up to us.”","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":[],"date":"February 11, 2018"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Music Monday: Glim Spanky","content":"For anyone who spent time in Japan in the late 90s and early 2000s and was exposed to the raspy, grungy sounds of the band Love Psychedelico, you’ll most certainly find comfort in Glim Spanky . Hailing from Nagano, the duo is led by 26-year old vocalist Remi Matsuo and joined by guitarist Hiroki Kamemoto. The name Glim Spanky comes from the lead singer’s interest in Celtic culture, as well as their attitude towards their own music. Apparently, “Glim” is like a mythical goblin creature while “spanky” embodies the singer’s intent to slap the music industry in the face with their music. Or something like that. Either way, it’s a memorable name. Matsuo and Kanemoto went to the same high school together, and it’s where Glim Spanky was originally formed, but as a tribute band. They later began writing their own music and then moved to Tokyo. But the two never forgot their roots as a cover band and continued to cover some of their musical influences like Janis Joplin and The Beatles. This cover of Joplin’s Move Over is quite good. One of the most alluring traits of the band is their rough, unpolished sound. And in Japan, where music tends to be overly engineered and dressed up, the diamond in the rough actually shines brighter. Like what you hear? You can find more of their music on YouTube .

Such is the focus of Toshizo Hirose, who has made it his life’s work to depict the unique characteristics of bath houses all across Japan in an equally unique medium: stamps. Each of Hirose’s stamp designs depicts an individual bath house in Japan with a particular focus on the bath house’s unique features: a stunning mural of Mount Fuji, a stately front entrance, a water spout in the shape of a lion’s head. By highlighting these specific quirks, Hirose hopes to inspire others to visit local public bath houses more frequently. In fact, traditional bath houses are disappearing in Japan, where one public bath house goes out of business about once a week. Last month, Hirose held two exhibitions in Tokyo of his stamp designs intended to generate interest in local public bath houses. The first , a partnership with the Tokyo Sento Association, included stamps Hirose created for the 22 public bath houses in Tokyo’s Arakawa Ward, which has the second-highest ratio of bath houses to residents in Tokyo. The second exhibition showcased roughly 100 stamps of individual bath houses all across Tokyo, representing what Hirose describes as a “ pilgrimage.” Visitors can even embark on their own pilgrimages by collecting stamps from each bath house featured in Hirose’s designs.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["onsen"],"date":"February 12, 2018"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Shokkiri: The Comedy Routine that Portrays Illegal Sumo Moves","content":"Sumo wrestling is a Japanese sport that, in its current form, dates back to the 16th century. Steeped in history and tradition, the sport is highly ritualistic and parts are often associated with Shintoism. However, just because it’s old doesn’t mean it lacks a sense of humor. In fact, there is an entire ritual called (初切 or 初っ切り) dedicated to making crowds laugh. Shokkiri is typically performed by two lower-ranking sumo wrestlers who can spend weeks planning and choreographing their routine. The main objective is to illustrate to audiences, often through slapstick humor, the many illegal moves and unacceptable behaviors of the sport. It’s the one time that all rules are broken in order to explain them. Shokkiri isn’t performed during tournaments but during other sumo-related events like retirement ceremonies or charity tournaments. The most recent one was performed last week on February 4, 2018, during the retirement ceremony of former-wrestler Asasekiryu. For the segment, wrestlers Takamisato and Shobushi illuminated audiences on the many illegal sumo moves.","post_categories":["Go and See"],"post_tags":["sports","sumo"],"date":"February 13, 2018"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Torietsu: Yakitori and Japanese Whisky Come Together in this Tokyo Eatery","content":"I’ve been on a Yakitori kick these days.

There’s nothing quite like sitting at the counter, watching the chef roast your skewer over hot coals as he fans the flames and smoke rises from the cinders. Omoide Yokocho, which also has the less-appetizing name Piss Alley, can be fun, but it’s swarming with tourists. If you’re looking for something a little more exclusive and intimate, head to Meguro where, nestled away on a side street is Torietsu. Torietsu is a gem of a spot where yakitori and Japanese whiskey come together, literally, as a family. The restaurant is run by Tsuyoshi Suzuki , who, this year, fulfilled his dream of running his own eatery with his father. The son spent the last 5 years in training, working at a different yakitori shop and waiting for the right time. That time finally came when his father retired from the famed Hotel Okura after working as a bartender for 45 years. Together, they opened Torietsu in May of 2017. The eatery stocks over 80 varieties of whiskey, many from Japan, but also from other countries. They source all of their jidori chicken from Kumamoto and the son’s grilling, combined with the father’s whiskey selection, makes for an unforgettable pairing. And the courses are reasonably priced: one at 3,000 yen and the other at 5,000 yen. The counter sits 8 and there 2 other tables that sit 8 more: small, but intimate.

Plagiarism allegations forced the committee to scrap their original logo and seek a new one . Then, when the new Tokyo Stadium proposal by the late Zaha Hadid was unveiled it was met with heavy criticisms over budget and site-specific appropriateness, which eventually forced the committee to start from scratch again . Now, with less than 1000 days to go, things seems to be back on track. Earlier this week 3 candidates were announced as potential mascots. Our first impression of the 3 candidates, which includes a pair – one for the Olympics and one for the Paralympics – is that they’re all quite similar. Each mascot (for now they’re being referred to as A, B and C) has their own unique characteristics but the general style makes it seem as if they were created by the same artist. And many of them were inspired by Japanese folklore. They remind us of something straight out of Yokai Watch, or Pokemon. For now, the creators remain anonymous but these 3 were selected from a bucket of 1753 entries that were vetted by a group of judges. Based on our first impressions, we’re going to say our favorite is Candidate B, which were inspired by Japanese folklore and fairy tales. We like A too for its visual consistency with the emblem. Candidate C is cute but looks a little too much like Jibanyan (from Yokai Watch). But it’s not up to us, or any adults, to make the decision. The final call will be made by schoolchildren from registered schools across Japan. That voting is set to take place From December – February with the final results being announced February 28, 2018.

Enomoto keeps his camera next to him at all times, snapping nighttime-scenes of streets, as well as passengers. But only with permission, and only if it’s safe. For Enomoto, there’s a poetic serendipity in the act of picking up an unknown passenger and taking them to some destination: a seemingly random sequence of dreamlike events that have everything to do with chance. Enomoto works at night and so the photographs are always dark. They appear to capture his view through the front window but also some kind of reflection that embeds the scene with an unintended view. The photos, in fact, are double exposure shots that are composed intentionally, and in an attempt to capture how he remembers things. “It’s like all those experiences are compressed into one single memory,” says the artist. There’s a dubious element to Enomoto’s work, which shows through in his photographs. But he assures us that he always gets permission from his passengers to take their photographs.

At least that’s according to Fujiko Fujio’s imaginative comic . Doraemon and his magical fourth-dimensional pocket, which produces fantastical gadgets from the future, have tickled the minds of children (including myself) since the 1970s to today. It was easily my favorite cartoon growing up in Tokyo. However, we didn’t have a television so I vividly remember my mom taking me to a local soba shop near our small apartment in Koenji. We would sit down and order our dinner. A couple of minutes before 7pm, my mom would stand up, walk over to the waitress, and kindly ask – in broken Japanese – if we could change the channel. Looking back, it must have been an odd sight: an American mother and her small child, quietly slurping their noodles while watching Doraemon. Surely those kinds of memories are one in a  million, and if you have your own nostalgic memory of Doraemon, head to the Mori Art Museum in Roppongi Hills where visual interpretations of everyone’s favorite cat robot is on full display thanks to a collaboration between 28 contemporary artists like Takashi Murakami, Yoshitomo Nara and Makoto Aida. “That’s not Shizuka-chan,” said a young child strolling through the gallery with his father. He was referring to a sexualized version of the comic’s lone female character, who had emerged from water dripping wet. Painted by the 32-year old artist Satomi Kondo, it was a reinterpretation of an actual scene. Those who overheard the boy’s comment couldn’t help but chuckle as they attempted to reconcile their own memories with the artist’s. Indeed, you won’t always find yourself nodding in approval but you’ll be stunned nonetheless to see the wide range of interpretations of a beloved character who has, by and large, remained constant in an ever-evolving society. One of the highlights for me was a small room camouflaged by double curtains to keep the light out. Inside the dark room, a small train on tracks with an LED light traverses through household objects, casting oversized shadows onto the walls and creating a world that felt like you were inside a comic book.

Nishimoto immediately fell in love with the medium and began taking humorous, comical and sometimes surreal self-portraits. 10 years later, at the age of 82, she was given her first solo exhibition at a local Museum in Kumamoto, where she lives. Her passion for photography and humor proved contagious, and she soon became an internet star. Still active at the age of 89, Nishimoto takes all her own pictures using a tripod and timer. All the digital enhancements and alterations are also done by Nishimoto herself. And now her work is going to be front and center at an exhibition in Tokyo taking place at Epson’s epsite imaging gallery . Titled “Asobokane” (遊ぼかね) – meaning “let’s play” in the artists local dialect – the exhibition will include new and previously unreleased digital artwork that examines the 89-year old artist’s passion for photography and outlook on life. “Asobokane” will be on display starting December 15, 2017 and will be up through January 18, 2018. If you’re nearby, go check it out. It’s a good reminder that it is *never* too late to do anything.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["Photography","tokyo guide","tokyo guide art shows"],"date":"November 13, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Uniholic: A New Tokyo Restaurant that Specializes in Sea Urchin","content":"Sea urchin, or uni, is a delicacy in Japan. But it’s also an acquired taste. For uni lovers like ourselves, you’re probably accustomed to having it served on rice as sushi, or as sashimi. Maybe the occasional uni pasta. But now a new Tokyo restaurant, aptly named Uniholic, wants to open up the doors to a whole new world of uni-possibilities. Uniholic opens tomorrow – November 15 – in Tokyo’s Roppongi district. And although the new restaurant specializes in a delicacy, they don’t want to be thought of as snobby. The restaurant is designed with a hip, casual ambiance with bar and even a communal table. The pendant lights that lovingly represent the underwater sea creature and its globular spines are a nice touch. At Uniholic, different varieties of sea urchin are sourced daily from all around Japan, and the world. Expect not only Japanese dishes but Italian and Spanish takes on sea urchin like Uni Acqua Pazza and Uni Ajillo. As far as pricing goes, Uniholic is serving a special 4-course uni dinner for 8000 yen to celebrate their opening. Uniholic is located on the 11th floor of the Yamato Building in Roppongi ( 7-14-5 Roppongi, Minato-ku, Tokyo ). Lunch hours are 11:30am – 2:30pm, Dinner hours are 5:00pm – 11:00 and their bar will stay open till 5am.

The hills and forests was her playground; the animals her friends. She remembers one animal in particular: a Japanese wolf she revered as her protector and guardian. For whenever she got lost in the woods the mountain dog would show itself and appear to lead her home, only to mysteriously disappear once she was safe. One day she visited a local shrine and came face-to-face with a , a sculpture of a lion-like deity guarding and protecting the shrine. Since then, Komatsu has always been cognizant of her many guardians, but also fascinated by how different cultures have their own guardians. Egypt has the sphynx; the gryphon and gargoyle appear throughout Europe; India has Naga; Thailand has the powerful lion Singha. Each appears in a different form but guardians transcend culture and religion and for centuries have stood as a symbol for peace. And so Komatsu has dedicated much of her artistic career to capturing these guardians on canvas in a style that is dynamic, spiritual and ritualistic. In her live painting performances, Komatsu typically dresses in white robes. In sudden bursts of energy she’ll splatter her canvas with acrylic paint, often augmenting her brushstrokes with her hands, which, along with her attire, quickly appears to become part of the painting. Komatsu’s work is currently on display at Whitestone New Gallery in Ginza through December 3, 2017. From December 2 – January 7, 2018 her works will also be on display at Whitestone Gallery Taipei.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["painting"],"date":"November 22, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Walk Through Old Tokyo with a 300-Year old Map of Edo","content":"When we were in Tokyo last month we downloaded the Oedo Burari app. It was pricey – 600 yen – but we decided to bite the bullet and go for it. And I have to say, it was worth it. Part of what makes Tokyo such a fun city to walk is its ancient history combined with its density. This app added a whole new dimension to Tokyo’s history by allowing you to walk along a map of old Edo originally created in the late 1600s. There are several of these such apps out there, and if there’s one you recommend, let us know in the comments! But the reason we chose this one is because it listed various sights of interest and locations , along with commentary, that are around even today. The app essentially overlays the old map on top of google maps and you can toggle back and forth. But it’s amazing see how city’s layout is still unchanged.

Why isn’t a painting alive?” It was that simple question that inspired Akiko Nakayama to create “Alive Paintings” that captures the vibrant movement, fluidity, energy and ephemerality of life by depicting the flow of paint and water. Depending on when the frame is frozen, still shots of Nakayama’s paintings can look like topographic heat maps visualizing some obscure data point. But to really appreciate its beauty, the 29-year old’s Alive Paintings must be ‘unfrozen’ and observed over a period of time as they, by definition, are continuously changing. In what is a cross between performance art and installation, Nakayama uses a multitude of kitchen basters loaded with paint and water to add, mix, tilt, blow and add all sorts of extraneous effects to her paints, recording and projecting it all onto a large screen. The result is a mesmerizing show of organic movements the resembles life itself viewed under a magnifying glass. In recent years she’s also added sound as another dimension to her work, as has collaborated with different musicians in liver performances. Most recently she performed with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at KLASSIK Underground in Tokyo . I think part of the allure of Nakayama’s paintings is that while she is seemingly in control and always appears to be present, much of what she creates is left up to chance.

Well Tokyo must be one of the most thoughtful and caring cities because during the month of December, the Nishi Tokyo Bus Company will operate a (overslept rescue bus) that will meet passengers at the final stop and carry them back. The rescue bus was actually the brainchild of one of the drivers, who pitched it to the company and they’ve been offering the service for the past 4 years . Last year 75 people utilized the service. Once again this year the rescue bus will operate on Friday evenings during December (specifically, the 8th 15th and 22nd ) because that’s when the majority of the New Year’s parties take place, hence the high occurrence of oversleeping folks. Service is limited to those who ride the Chuo-line but the rescue bus will be awaiting you at 12:55 when the final train pulls into the final stop at Takao Station. It will then work its way back to Hachioji Station making several stops along the way. You can see the full timetable on the company’s website.

But accessing the high shelves can be a problem. The common side-kick has always been ladders, which can also add character and charm. But for smaller homes like in Japan they can be a nuisance, occupying too much space for not enough usage. But Japanese architect Shinsuke Fujii came up with a simple, yet brilliant solution that solves another problem too: earthquake safety. The “ House in Shinyoshida ,” as it’s called, named for the neighborhood in Yokohama where it stands, was conceived shortly after the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake. The client, who happened to be an avid book lover, approached Fujii with the task to design a home around a large bookshelf that’s both easily accessible but also one that won’t spill all the books if there’s ever a tremor. The solution was to slant the entire western-facing façade and create a built-in slanted bookshelf whose shelves also function as a ladder. The slant allowed family members of all ages to climb up and reach books, but also keeps the books from falling should an earthquake ever shake the home. The slanted façade also had the effect of creating an open feeling in the family room, where the home’s high perch allowed for plenty of sunlight to enter through the large windows.

Although Japan and West Africa are oceans apart, these were some of the similarities that art director Serge Mouangue identified during his trip to Japan back in 2007. And in hindsight, this was the birth of Wafrica : an African kimono that blends Japanese refinement and attention to detail with West African rhythmic density and vibration. “In response to the argument that globalization may rob us of our cultural identity, a conversation between two ancient, strong and sophisticated identities: Japan and Africa,” says Mouange , explaining the thinking behind his initiative. “The conversation is about the beauty of weaving strands of our stories together.” Indeed, Mouange recalls the time a Japanese customer, curious and open, asked to try on the kimono. “Her reaction was spontaneous: ‘I am wearing a piece of universal heritage’”. The Wafrica kimonos , however, are so much more than a blend of 2 different cultures. They’re an attempt to redefine the narrative and get us to see a third aesthetic: one that respects the codes, beauties and qualities of two cultures.

And a small stand would sell fresh vegetables that had just been harvested. Those urban farms have virtually disappeared. But now, in one of the most unlikely spots, a farm encapsulated by a digital, technicolor greenhouse, has sprouted up, and is welcoming visitors in to smell, touch and learn about agriculture. Digital Vegetables , or Digi Vege, as the project is being called in Japan, is the work of PARTY and is located in Tokyo Midtown’s garden space. It’s part of the venue’s 2017 Design Touch event and, true to its name, encourages visitors to step into the digitally equipped, futuristic greenhouse and touch the 7 different kinds of vegetables growing inside. Touching them triggers a series of lights and sounds, all controlled by a meticulously programmed system and designed to spark ideas about the shapes and colors that are growing beneath the soil. “Start off by touching the 7 types of lives now growing strong in the soil,” says Naoki Ito, who was in charge of overall direction. “Then, bathe in the design of vegetables, enhanced by videos and sounds.” Sound designer Ray Kunimoto recorded sounds of rubbing seeds, touching leaves and eating fruits. “Tomatoes are violin, carrots are trumpet, cabbages are oboe, mini radishes are flute, sweet potatoes are piano, eggplants are harp, pumpkins are clarinet,” says Kunimoto, who mixed actuals sounds from vegetables with orchestra instruments. Digital Vegetables is on display in Tokyo Midtown through November 5th, 2017.

But it wasn’t just fires. Situated on an active fault line and surrounded by sea, citizens of Japan were always aware of the imminent dangers posed by earthquakes and tsunamis, a mindset that led to the development of mobility culture. People shunned the idea of owning heavy furniture and, instead, opted for a more minimal lifestyle by sleeping on futons and wrapping and carrying their belongings in furoshiki. A new brand of products is proposing a return to such a culture, and has launched a suite of products inspired by their ancestors. ONFAdd stands for “Of No Fixed Address” and is a new design label launched by a group of Japanese artists, product designers, architects, fashion designers and other creatives. Together, they’re proposing a reversion to more post-apocalyptic ways. Stability, in other words, is not only overrated but, in this day and age, it’s not a given. Taking cues from ancient Japanese artwork and historical photographs, the team has developed a suite of products that reconstruct mobility culture. They include the Futokoro minimal wallet and laptop backpack , the Futon portable sleeping pack (with optional solar panel), the Furoshiki backpack and the Samue maintenance-free suit. In a credit to their creative marketing, they even reverse-engineered their products back into historical Japanese Ukiyo-e. For those looking to adopt this new lifestyle, the entire suite of products will cost you $3260, which seems high until you realize you’re not going to be making those monthly payments on your apartment any more.","post_categories":["Industrial Design"],"post_tags":["wearable"],"date":"October 20, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Japanese Man Used Bonsai Techniques to Grow Marijuana","content":"A 35-year old janitor living in Osaka was arrested at his home last month for growing and selling marijuana.

What he captured was the cultural diversity in a nation commonly mistaken by outsiders to be homogeneous. Instead of photographing the festivals themselves, Fréger scouted nearby natural landscapes to act as the backdrops for the figures. This was not always an easy task due to the handmade nature of the costumes and masks, many of which were made on the day of the festival. Outside of their typical context, these appear to inhabit their own world, which is what inspired the title of Fréger’s project: , or “island of monsters.” Perhaps one of the most fascinating aspects of these costumes is the visibility of the people behind the masks. “I think there is a willingness to show that the man is still there, in control of the figure,” says Fréger . “People aren’t transformed; they are playing. What’s really apparent about Japan in this project is theatricality.” A photobook of the project was published in August 2016 by Thames & Hudson.

But one necessity often overlooked is the availability of working toilets. In the wake of recent natural disasters in Japan such as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami and the Kumamoto earthquakes of 2016, Tokyo-based design company nendo teamed up with hardware supplier Sugita-Ace to combat this problem by designing a simple, innovative portable toilet kit they’ve dubbed the minimLET. One of the biggest challenges of designing a portable toilet is, quite simply, its portability. Nendo’s designers downsized their toilet kit into six items: a toilet seat, aluminum pipes, nylon tent cloth, pocket tissues, garbage bags and coagulant. Bulky elements such as the tent or the toilet seat had to be either scaled down or eliminated entirely. The minimLET works around these issues by having multifunctional parts: the aluminum poles can be used to prop up the toilet seat or support the nylon tent, which can also function as a poncho. Cheap, everyday items can also add functionality to the kit, and in a modern city like Tokyo, are often available at or near evacuation centers. Bearing this in mind, the minimLET’s structure can also be supported with a plastic umbrella, tin cans, or plastic bottles. The entire kit fits into a bag about the size of a laptop case. The bag itself has a gusseted bottom which can hold up to 16 liters of water, or roughly the amount needed for two toilet flushes. The minimLET is scheduled for retail launch in 2018 in Japan. With the increasing frequency of natural disasters and the limited access to toilets in many developing countries, one hopes that portable toilet kits like the minimLET can serve people in need worldwide.","post_categories":["Industrial Design"],"post_tags":["Nendo"],"date":"October 25, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Stray Cats Captured in Martial Arts Poses by Hiroyuki Hisakata","content":"Armed with an Olympus digital camera and a bag full of cat toys, Japanese photographer Hiroyuki Hisakata ventures off to an island populated by stray cats to photograph his feline friends.

A recent mention in Vogue proves that this “Japan Blue” is still highly fashionable. And judging by the vibrant hues Japanese indigo dye produces, it’s no surprise why. Japanese indigo is incredibly versatile. Sukumo, the type used by BUAISOU, contains properties that prevent it from transferring or bleeding onto other garments, even white ones. The intensity of the indigo changes based on factors such as how long the fabric mixes with the dye or the way it is dipped into the dye vats. As a result, each object dyed with sukumo indigo is truly unique. The dye is derived from the leaves of the Japanese indigo plant that is native to Tokushima prefecture, where BUAISOU’s farm and studio are located. Once harvested, the indigo leaves are dried and then fermented in a vat of ash lye, wheat bran, and calcium hydroxide. The indigo color is the result of oxidization when fabric is dipped into the dye and exposed to the air. Indigo dyeing in Japan dates back to the 12th century in Tokushima prefecture on the island of Shikoku. For a large part of Japanese history, Tokushima was the center of Japan’s indigo production — until the creation of synthetic indigo in the 20th century. Now the number of indigo farms in Japan has dwindled from over a thousand to just four, including the one operated by BUAISOU. Nevertheless, the cultural significance of Tokushima’s traditional indigo dye remains: it was designated as an intangible cultural property by the Japanese government in 1968. BUAISOU’s vision involves “preserving the tradition of Japanese indigo,” and bringing “new vitality to ‘Japan Blue’ through our artistic and functional creations.” Many of these creations can be purchased on their online store or made by hand at any of their public workshops.","post_categories":["Fashion"],"post_tags":["tradition"],"date":"October 30, 2017"},{"author":"Rachel Mimms","title":"Reimagining the Design Event at Tokyo’s ‘Designart’","content":"Conveniently coinciding with Tokyo Fashion Week is Tokyo’s newest event celebrating contemporary art and design, aptly named ‘Designart.’ After its predecessor Tokyo Design Week permanently closed following the death of a five-year old at an exhibit in 2016 , Designart’s creators sought to fill the void in Tokyo’s modern art and design scene. The result is a sprawling week-long event spread across multiple Tokyo neighborhoods with over 70 exhibitions covering all aspects of design from fashion to photography to technology. The theme for Designart’s inaugural festival is “Bringing emotion into our daily lives.” Architect Yuji Okitsu seeks to entertain the connection between emotion and light with an installation of ‘lightflakes,’ which are very thin and lightweight lenses that can be assembled into any shape for any purpose: furniture, decoration, entertainment. The light refracted through the lightflakes changes with the availability of natural light throughout the daytime. Also included in the festival is the Amaranth Chair created by artist and architect Satoshi Itasaka . The chair is Itasaka’s own sardonic critique of (traditional Japanese cuisine) which, although designated as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage, often contains the food dye Amaranth, a known carcinogen banned in the United States but still in use in Japan. The red upholstery is a nod to Amaranth’s crimson color. Designart ‘s founders want “to go beyond design and art and encourage creative people of diverse backgrounds … regardless of culture, field or generation; to interact with each other, to create new value.” Although most of the designers featured are Japanese, a number of Western and non-Japanese artists are included as well. One such example is a collaboration between French designer Philippe Nigro and lacquerware craftsmen in Akita prefecture. The objects in this collection were made using traditional Akita lacquerware and wood craft.

The most recent example is this LED Flashlight recently released from Japanese minimal lifestyle retailer MUJI. It has space for two AA batteries and two AAA batteries but it will work with any combination, even just one battery. It simply emits it different glow.

The phrases that are used are sometimes seasonal, sometimes random but in either case, Nozaki renders them with pictorial style that is enjoyable even if you can’t read Japanese. Japanese, like many languages, has different writing styles that have evolved, in part, due to their historic tradition of calligraphy, or shodo. Aside from normal printform styles, there are various gyousho and sousho styles that combine and simplify strokes, sometimes to the point of recognition. This tradition has allowed for further experimentation in Japanese typography, which often incorporates imagery from the actual meaning of that kanji. Nozaki, a recent graduate from Aichi Prefectural University of the Arts, builds on this tradition of experimentation by creating highly graphic kanji that incorporate elements of color, geometry and, of course, style. You can see a lot more of Nozaki’s work right here .","post_categories":["Graphic Design"],"post_tags":["typography"],"date":"October 11, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"A 280-Year Old Dried Foods Shop in Tokyo Gets a Facelift","content":"In 1737 a shop opened for business in what is now Nihonbashi, a central part of Tokyo that neighbors Ginza. And for 8 generations Yagicho Honten has stayed in business by producing and selling what is the backbone of Japanese cuisine: dried foods like (dried bonito), (kelp), and mushrooms, three basic ingredients that go into soup stock. Now, on the 280 anniversary of its birth, the shop has been renovated in a deep-redish hue that pays homage to both the original color of the structure, as well as the color of the dried bonito. “We made wood boxes for display in the main store space out of MDF (medium-density fiberboard) in the same color, and placed them in stacks to create a space like a marketplace,” explained architect Jo Nagasaka . Centrally located and also serving as a major focal point is a large copper countertop that functions as a kitchen for demonstrations but also where customers conduct transactions. The shop periodically conducts workshops and demonstrations on how to use their dried ingredients to make . Yagicho Honten emits a certain regal self-assurance that most certainly connects to its long tenure in the neighborhood. On sunny days, the store opens all its doors, creating a close connection to the city and its people.

In fact, take Tokyo’s skin and apply it to any other city in the world and it will look like Tokyo. Tokyo Signs is a new brand of fashion that takes inspiration from the streets of Tokyo that’s “bursting with visual delights at every turn.” Tokyo Signs is the brainchild of Bento Graphics , a Tokyo-based design and web development studio that, in the interest of full disclosure, was responsible for Spoon & Tamago’s website renewal in 2014 . “Our aim is to capture everything we encounter in the Japanese streetscape,” says the team. “Roadmarks, signage, advertising, traffic signs, storefronts, sign boards, neon lights, street art and everything in-between.” That visual database becomes a key reference point for graphics that are then cleverly incorporated into t-shirts, tote bags and other fashion items. Even their homepage is an homage to the streets of Tokyo in that it almost feels like a stroll down some side street. The t-shirts range between $29.50 – $41 while the tote bag is $34.50 and the leggings $39.95.

Entirely self-taught, Akira blends elements of photography, graphic design, , styling and make-up to create radical, neo-pop imagery, which he’s been posting online since 2008. Using the moniker “ Akira Times ,” the artist is bent on reviving the kimono, which he says is being suffocated by the “ Kyoto sickness ” that emphasizes conservative formality. And his images manifest in the form of magazine covers, which take on different titles depending on the subject. The images began to gain traction online and “people began to look for the real magazine, but there is only the cover that he makes and posts online,” explains Sheila Cliffe, in her book The Social Life of Kimono . “He liked the idea that the internet can bring into reality something that did not exist before.” Akira insists on working with normal people, instead of models, who travel from all over Japan to his studio in Yamagata in the Northeast part of the country.

Even with digital software, colorists have had so colorize the images piece-by-piece; pixel-by-pixel. But now, a team of Japanese researchers at Waseda University, led by Dr. Ishikawa, has utilized artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning to create a program that automatically colorizes photographs. The task was accomplished through the deep learning and color matching of 2.3 million color photographs.

For his ongoing series “Bloom” he’s launched bouquets of flowers into space and floated them in the middle of the sea . But the artist, whose work often deals with the ephemeral nature of his subject matter, has frozen flowers in blocks of ice and placed them at the center of decommissioned power plants . His latest endeavor was to plunge bouquets and a bonsai into the least explored part of this planet: the bottom of the sea. Three years of planning – both in building equipment and obtaining government permits – came to fruition this summer when, in late August, Azuma sailed out into the Suruga bay. His team of 15 proceeded to plunge 4 exquisite bouquets of flowers and one bonsai 2000 meters, or a little more than 1 mile, down to the sea floor. Each plant was secured in the center of a steel-infused plastic frame that was also equipped with lights and photographic equipment. “In contrast to the bright summer daylight at the foot of Mount Fuji, the flowers will be swallowed slowly into the darkness, where not a single ray of light shines,” said the artist. It’s said that only 5% of the earth’s sea floors have been mapped, and for good reason. The intense water pressure and lack of any light or oxygen makes it one of the most harshest environments on earth.  But that is what makes Azuma’s flowers all the more beautiful as they stand in stark contrast with the depths of the sea and the mysterious sea creatures that have come to observe this alien life form.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["makoto azuma"],"date":"September 22, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Music Monday: Red Bull Music Festival Tokyo","content":"We usually introduce you to a new artist on Music Monday .

They paraded down a street, through the city’s shopping district and even went on a ferry ride, all the while chanting “We are Bread Men. We are not human” in Japanese and English. This was not the latest All Breads Matter protest. Rather, it was a performance art piece by 71-year old Japanese artist Tatsumi Orimoto called “Bread Man” and has been staged around the world over 200 times. In the early 70s Orimoto spent time in New York working as Nam June Paik’s assistant and taking part in the Fluxus movement and the performance art pieces of John Cage, Yoko Ono and Joseph Beuys. Around 1991 a defining moment for Orimoto occurred when he learned that in the Bible ‘bread means body.’ That’s what gave him the idea for Bread Man. “If Marcel Duchamp could call a toilet a fountain then bread means not food: it is sculpture.” Orimoto keeps what he calls his own bible: large yellow binders packed with postcards of his past performances. He staged Bread Man in Turkey, Nepal, Germany, London and he’s been chased by homeless people in New York and thrown out of a restaurant in Moscow for wasting food. But nothing has stopped him from wrapping at least 6 baguettes around his head in various configurations and exploring the world, challenging people to accept him.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["bread","food"],"date":"September 26, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Sarutahiko Coffee’s New Flagship Store in Chofu, Tokyo","content":"If there’s anyone that can give Blue Bottle in Japan a run for their money it’s Sarutahiko Coffee , Japan’s homegrown specialty coffee shop.

The Yayoi Kusama Museum opens to the public today, October 1. We were there last week for a sneak peek into what visitors can expect from the 5-story building.  Visitors expecting a large-scale retrospective like the types we’ve seen staged by U.S. museums may be disappointed as the initial impression upon entering the ground level is that the space is quite small. But then again, what kind of venue would ever be able to hold the tremendous volume of works that Kusama has created over her vast career? After moving through the reception desk on the ground level and paying the 1000 yen admission, visitors move to the 2nd floor, a space dedicated to Kusama’s black & white works. A note on tickets: you must reserve advance tickets for a 90-minute window online. Tickets are released 3-months in advance and, as of now, tickets through year-end are sold out. Tickets for January 2018 will be released November 1 at 10AM Japan time. Anyone who has attended one of her large shows overseas will be accustomed to this format. If you’re able to score tickets, however, the experience should be quite serene. Only 50 visitors will be admitted at a time for one of four 90-minute slots per day. The third floor is a large, open space dedicated to Kusama’s color paintings. A vaulted ceiling and a beautiful winding staircase beckon visitors to the 4th floor, where a single Instagram-friendly immersive infinity room awaits. On the 5th floor is a small library with books and magazines dedicated to the life and works of Yayoi Kusama. There is also an outdoor space that’s home to one of Kusama’s newly-sculpted large pumpkins. Kusama personally selected the works that are part of the current exhibition, which plans to rotate every 6 months. Speaking with the press, the artist expressed her love for humanity and her hopes for mankind. In her small and frail voice she explained that she wanted a place in Tokyo where fans of her work could come to. “I hope my works contribute to a society without war,” she said, hardly audibly.

The band’s name Nulbarich is a combination of the words “null but rich” and embodies a mantra that favors spiritual enrichment over physical. And it’s part of the reason that the band members prefer to remain masked and relatively anonymous (although JQ has begun appearing in some of the music videos), placing an emphasis on their sound rather than their appearance. JQ attributes his interest in music to early piano lessons and then to 90s hip hop but the group’s sound is grounded in soul and acid jazz-inspired funk that’s then mixed with Tokyo street culture.

Replicating the botanic subject with perceptive realism, it would become the most well-known botanical encyclopedia. 190 years later, the Japanese photographer Kenij Toma has created a highly contemporary and hyper-realistic tribute to the genre inspired, surprisingly, by traditional Japanese painting style. “Dating back many centuries, Western botanical illustrations were primarily used to depict the details of plant species for the identification of specimens with medicinal properties,” explains Kyohei Abe, Executive Director of the Detroit Center for Contemporary Photography. Kenji Toma is doing the opposite, but with a camera, which – intrinsically – is designed capture realism. Currently based in New York, Toma is a commercial photographer and his new photobook “ The Most Beautiful Flowers ,” is almost reminiscent of commercial photography: crisp lines and lush colors that seduce the eye. Except his subjects are products of nature, not intended to be commercialized. And contrary to Western botanical illustrations, Toma’s work is more akin to the Japanese botanical paintings that came out of the rimpa school: “brightly saturated and flattened images [that] were made for aesthetic enjoyment rather than for the scientific reasons normally associated with botanical art.” To create photographs, which both hyper-realistic to the point of looking artificial, Toma utilized a process called focus-bracket shooting. It’s a method of photography often employed to shoot close-up, macro photos in which the final photograph is a composite of several images of the subject with each element in full focus. “Hyper-realism allows him to capture the specimen’s idealized beauty, creating a work that is deeply modern, yet in harmony with a rich Japanese history and tradition.” Toma’s photobook is available in the Spoon & Tamago shop . Several selected prints are also going to be on display at the Tokyo gallery 916 Small from September 16 – October 15, 2017.

Bandai (Fukushima prefecture), a popular vacation spot that’s dotted with resorts. The cabin’s unique, elevated structure was informed by the region’s heavy snowfall, which typically sees about 6.5 ft of snow. An outdoor bridge connects “wet” (bathroom, kitchen) and “dry” (living room, bedroom) areas. This way only one of the structures required plumbing. In many ways the home was intended to have a neutral impact on the environment. Only locally harvested wood was used for the project. The construction process began not with the foundation, but with the felling of trees, and took exactly 1 year, ending with the final step of planting and replacing trees in order to restore the environment.

And that’s exactly what happened in Fukushima where, 6 years ago, residents were forced to evacuate due to the nuclear disaster that unfolded in the wake of the Great East Japan Earthquake. Tetsuro Takehana, who spent 10 years in Fukushima as a child and is now a staff photographer for the Asahi, recently visited the “difficult-to-return zones” to capture its current state. “It was as if time had stopped,” he says. “And yet the grass and trees continue to grow.” Indeed, in striking aerial footage captured by the photographer, the resilience and tenacity of mother nature is on full display, and we see how quickly the trees, grass and vines have reclaimed the earth. Cars appeared buried in a sea of green, weeds grow from cracks in the parking lot like pulsing veins and rampant vines have climbed to the roofs of houses and condominiums.

Located in the outskirts of Sapporo, a large stone Buddha occupies the sprawling landscape. All 1500 tons of it has sat alone there for 15 years. But when the cemetery decided they wanted to do something to increase visitor’s appreciations for the Buddha, they enlisted architect Tadao Ando, who had a grand and bold idea: hide the statue. We included Hill of Buddha in our Hokkaido Guide published last year. “Our idea was to cover the Buddha below the head with a hill of lavender plants,” said Ando. Indeed, as you approach “ Hill of Buddha ” the subject is largely concealed by a hill planted with 150,000 lavenders. Only the top of the statue’s head pokes out from the rotunda, creating a visual connection between the lavender plants and the ringlets of hair on the Buddha statue’s head. Upon entering, visitors are forced to turn left or right and walk around a rectangular lake of water before entering the 131-ft (40-meter) long approach tunnel. The journey is a constant reminder of the weather, the breeze and the light, and is works in tandem to heighten anticipation of the statue, which is only visible once you reach the end of the tunnel. Any time of the year, visitors will have a different experience. The 150,000 lavenders “turn fresh green in spring, pale purple in summer and silky white with snow in winter.” It really is a miraculous work of environmental art. The Makomanai Cemetery is a little difficult to get to, but well worth the effort. If you have a car it’s about a 30-min drive from central Sapporo. You can also take a subway from Sapporo Station to Makomanai Station and then board the #2 or #3 bus.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["Hokkaido","tadao ando"],"date":"August 2, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Quirky Ballpoint Pen Illustrations of Japan by Yukihiro Tada","content":"Among the vast collection of work by Osaka-based illustrator and manga artist Yukihiro Tada are a series of ballpoint pen drawings of Japan.

The 5-story structure will open to the public on October 1 , 2017. Very little was known about the tall white structure when it was originally completed in 2014 by Kume Sekkei . Peering through its large glass windows as it glistened among the grey and brown apartment buildings, residents and tourists alike speculated about its use. Was it Kusama’s residence? Was it a private gallery? Was it always intended as a museum but its opening delayed due to Kusama’s health? Without any explanation, the Yayoi Kusama Museum , along with a new website, announced that the museum was now ready to open. Accordingly, the ground level will house the entrance and gift shop. Floors 2 and 3 will be exhibition spaces for Kusama’s works while the 4 floor will be dedicated to the artist’s Instagram-friendly immersive installations. The 5 floor will serve as a reading room dedicated to storing documents and material relating to Kusama and her work. It will also contain an outdoor space. The museum will also host rotating exhibitions twice a year. The inaugural exhibition, titled “Creation is a Solitary Pursuit, Love is What Brings You Closer to Art” will run from October 1, 2017 – February 25, 2018. General admission is 1000 yen.

But don’t just take our word for it. It’s considered to be 1 of “Three Views of Japan,” a select list of the country’s 3 most celebrated scenic sights. So instead of coping with the swarms of tourists in Tokyo and Kyoto, we recently had the opportunity to head up North because beaches and seafood were calling our name. If you’re traveling from Tokyo, Sendai Station will be your hub where you get off the Shinkansen and transfer to a local train. But don’t just pass through. Spend some time in this station because there’s so many good eats. We recommend trying some zunda, a local treat made from ground edamame. Zunda-mochi and zunda-shakes (we tried both) are two common variations. We also highly recommend the sake shop, which has a vending machine to top all Japanese vending machines. It has a sake tasting vending machine that, for 100 yen, will poor you small cups of different local sake. It’s like playing the slot machines except you never lose. Take the JR Senseki Line to Matsushimakaigan Station, a quaint little platform of a stop that looks over Matsushima Bay. A short walk and you’ll reach a pier where ferrys take you off on a 1-hour cruise that circles the bay and follows the route explored by Japanese haiku master Matsuo Basho. It’s a wonderful way to get acquainted with a region that is blessed with some of the most beautiful island scenery in the country. The boat passes many islands, each with a different name and a distinct shape and form. A few steps down the pier is Godaido Temple and the vermillion bridge connecting, which connects the small island to the coast. Depending on your fear of heights (or your leg span), the bridge could be quite harrowing. Planks are deliberately spaced far apart so that you must look down, through the planks, and at the sea below as you cross. The present structure was built in 1604 by Date Masamune. In the temple are installed images of the five guardian Buddhist deities. Walking around the temple you can see some fantastic craftwork that includes the zodiac animals carved into all four walls. There aren’t too many places where you can get up-close and personal with a 400-year old temple, and then turn around to be surrounded by the beauty of the sea. This isn’t for everyone but if you’re into it, Ume Luv , which is conveniently located right near the port, offers kimono rentals. For 5000 yen you can select from over 200 designs and the gracious host will fit you up so you’re ready to go. You can then walk around the historic temples, sit down for green tea and sweets and take in the scenery, all the while feeling as though you’ve been transported back in time. There’s a wonderful little tea house called kanran-tei right nearby where you can do such a thing. Whether you’re clothed in traditional kimono attire or not, a stroll through Matsushima’s best-known structure and the most famous Zen temple in northern Japan is definitely worth it. Located just a couple minutes’ walk from Matsushima Kaigan Pier, its entrance is shaded by tall cedar trees. The green carpet of moss below the trees sets the stage for the calm, serene environment. Highlights include the pathway leading to the temple, which is dotted with caves and grottoes dug out by priests long ago. The impressive main hall and its interior, which features wood-carved transoms and brilliantly painted, gold-plated fusuma. If you’ve been following our recommendations, the day is probably coming to an end. But before you pack it up for the night, head to Ootakamori for one last excursion. The relatively small mountain is an enjoyable 30-min hike that will take you 350ft above water for a fantastic view over the sea and islands. And while the sunset is certainly breathtaking, making the hike any time of day is worthwhile. The mountain is a bit out of the way so check to see if your lodge offers a shuttle. Speaking of lodging, Matsushima has plenty of inn and hotels for all budgets. One of the more high-end hotels is Ubudo , which is large but not too large. The food is amazing, the rooms and rooftop baths are luxurious. And it has this cool Southeast-Asian island vibe. For the budget-conscious traveler there are also many Ryokan-style inns and one of them is Chidorikan . The rooms are sparse but clean; the meals (which are included) are just as amazing as any high-end hotel. And it’s just steps from the sea. For the active and adventurous, Matsushima offers a host of experience-based activities like sea kayaking, boat fishing and boat steering. Try your hand at operating a fishing boat (with an instructor by your side) or traditional basket fishing (keep what you catch!). At the very least, let a local fisherman take you out on the sea for an experience you won’t forget.","post_categories":["Go and See"],"post_tags":["spoon tamago guide"],"date":"August 11, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Ukiyo-e Come to Life in New Animated GIFs by Atsuki Segawa","content":"Atsuki Segawa is a Japanese filmmaker and animator who takes traditional Japanese Ukiyo-e woodblock prints and sets them into motion through digital animation.

And if you’re looking to do some domestic traveling around Japan but not sure where to go, planning your trip around one of these isn’t a bad idea. We’ve got you covered from the North, all the way to the South. The inaugural Reborn Art Festival, is a celebration of art, music and food and is being held in Ishinomaki, one of Miyagi prefecture’s hardest hit regions during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Musical acts are performing daily for the 51-day festival and a roster of international and Japanese artists have installed artwork throughout Ishinomaki City and Oshika Peninsula. Artists include Yayoi Kusama, Kohei Nawa, Chim Pom, Bruce Nauman and JR’s Inside Out project. Artwork is a little spread out but organizers have free shuttle buses that take you around to different locations. The festival is coming to an end soon but it’s up through September 10th, 2017. General admission passports are 3,000 yen. Occuring every 3 years, as the name indicates, the Yokohama Triennial is back for a 6th season. Based on the theme “Islands, Constellations & Galapagos,” the triennial will examine “Connectivity” and “Isolation” in in our current world, promising to be a timely event as our digitally-connected world faces protectionism and xenophobia. Key highlights include a large-scale installation by Ai Wei Wei and work by other internationally renowned artists like Jenny Holzer, Olafur Eliasson, Yoi Kawakubo and Sam Durant. Venues are all close together and include Yokohama Museum of Art, Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse No.1 and Yokohama Port Opening Memorial Hall and the Triennial is currently on view through November 5, 2017. General admission is 1,500 yen Inaugurated in 2014, the Sapporo International Art Festival is back for its 2nd edition in one of our very favorite regions of Japan. Over 100 artists have descended upon Sapporo and installed artworks of all genres in Noguchi Isamu’s Moerenuma Park, Sapporo Art Park and other locations throughout the city. Highlights include an multi-sensory sound and music installation at Sapporo Art Park, the participatory “O-Furoshiki Project” and an installation of more than 100 secondhand record players at Moerenuma Park. The festival is on now through October 1, 2017. Admission varies depending on the venue. This one is less of an art festival and more of an large-scale solo exhibition of immersive works by TeamLab, who have transformed the 172-year old Mifuneyama Rakuen Park in Saga Prefecture into a sprawling show of digital art merged with nature. But due to the nature of the work (outdoor digital installations and projections) it’s only on view in the evening but check out the website for exact hours. The show is up now through October 9, 2017. General admission is 1600 yen Dubbed as the art festival nearest to the future, occurring on the island nearest to space, this inaugural festival is taking place on Tanegashima, an island off of Kyushu that is home to the Tangegashima Space Center, Japan’s largest space development center. Although notably smaller in scale than some of the other festivals, a talented group of Japanese artists will have space and rocket-themed installations like a sculpture made from a piece of a rocket that fell from the sky and a large-scale replica of a rocket ship made from recycled plastic bottles.

Based in Chiba, Kanemaki carves small, disturbing forms that allure to the duality he finds. “Looking deep into the world in which we live, we realize that everyone holds hesitations or contradictions that can never be reconciled,” he says. And so he attempts to project those emotions onto his sculptures, which he carves out of single blocks of hinoki wood. The sculptures often have 2 or more faces that oppose but also converge.

Last month, the Japanese government passed a new anti-terror conspiracy law that has drawn controversy among Japanese citizens who feel it is a threat to civil liberties and privacy. Artist Megumi Igarashi (pen name Rokudenashiko), famously arrested in 2014 on charges of obscenity for distributing 3D data of her genitals, is creating a set of playing cards that educate people about what it’s like to be arrested in Japan. Critics of the anti-conspiracy law claim it is too broadly worded and contains acts that have little to no connection to terrorism, such as: copying music, picking mushrooms in conservation forests, and competing in a motor boat race without a license. No stranger to the absurdity of Japanese law, Ms. Igarashi is responding by making a tongue-in-cheek karuta card game set depicting scenarios of arrest and imprisonment in Japan partly based on her own experiences. Each one has a drawing humorously portraying the situation described on the other side of the card. Through these “jail cards,” players can learn about Japanese prison conditions, police interrogation, and testifying in court. She has already posted 17 of these cards to her Twitter account and says she plans to create an entire set of 50 — one for each Japanese syllable — so that anyone can print them out and play along.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["Megumi Igarashi"],"date":"July 10, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Imaginative Flower Vases Showcase the Beauty of Metal","content":"In postwar Japan, numerous metal processing companies sprouted up in the port town of Yokohama.

But it was made for parents to use as leverage whenever their child acted up, or misbehaved. And boy was it effective. These concepts of hell ( ; 地獄 in Japanese) are derived from ancient Buddhist scriptures, and I’m ceaselessly amazed by the imagination of the monks and artists who came up with so many different forms of punishment. The range from the fairly standard – being eaten alive by demons and dragons, or being torn apart at the crotch – to the more inventive – being forced to hold large stalks of daikon radish in your mouth and being used as a drumstick. Then, there’s my favorite: being flattened out by a roller and then cut up into soba noodles. Now, a new art book that’s being released in October has collected a wide range of images that depict hell in Japanese art from the 12th century to the 19th century. The massive single-volume collection consists of almost 600 pages of works designated as Japanese National Treasures and features the various depictions of hell by artists such as Kazunobu Kanō,Yoshitoshi Tsukioka and the master of horror Kyōsai Kawanabe. It’s currently available for pre-order on Amazon . Essays from historians of both Japanese art and Buddhism are also included in bilingual text. If you have kids you may (or may not) want to leave this book sitting around.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["history"],"date":"August 1, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Photos of Japanese Playground Equipment at Night by Kito Fujio","content":"In 2005 Kito Fujio quit his job as an office worker and became a freelance photographer. And for the last 12 years he’s been exploring various overlooked pockets of Japan like the rooftops of department stores, which typically have games and rides to entertain children while their parents are shopping. More recently, he’s taken notice of the many interesting cement-molded play equipment that dots playgrounds around Japan. The sculptural, cement-molded play equipment is often modeled after animals that children would be familiar with. But they also take on the form of robots, abstract geometric forms and sometimes even household appliances. Fujio’s process is not entirely clear, but it appears he visits the parks at night and lights up the equipment from the inside, but also from the outside, which often creates an ominous feel to the harmless equipment.  Speaking of harmless, the nostalgic cement molds have been ubiquitous throughout Japan and, for the most part, free of safety concerns. That’s because the cement requires almost no maintenance; maybe just a fresh coat of paint every few years. The telephone (pictured below) is evidence of how long ago the equipment was probably made. The sculptural cement equipment was a style favored by Isamu Noguchi, who designed his first landscape for children in 1933. Many of his sculptural playground equipment can be found in Sapporo but also stateside at Piedmont Park in Atlanta. Fujio has made his photographs available as part of a series of photobooks (each priced at 800 yen) that he sells on his website .","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["Kids","Photography"],"date":"June 28, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Clever Packaging Design For Japanese Maekake Aprons","content":"are a type of Japanese apron that, for hundreds of years, have been favored by the working men and women of rice shops, sake shops, miso shops and other stores that dot Japan’s many shopping streets.

Then, dive into DERIVE , a visual project by Tokyo-based art director Cody Ellingham . Ellingham is originally from New Zealand, a place, he describes , as “difficult to find a contrast between old and new.” Tokyo, on the other hand, is quite the opposite. On the surface, and under each layer, and many levels of history. Having relocated to Tokyo, Ellingham was working a design job in Ueno. He would leave early in the morning and return late at night, only occasionally emerging from the darkness. This became the genesis for DERIVE. Elligham wandered Tokyo, capturing it in the dark in a cyberpunk aesthetic inspired by William Gibson’s 1984 novel Neuromancer , which is set in a dystopian Japanese underworld. “DERIVE is about showing the layers of the world’s first cyberpunk city,” says Ellingham . “It’s history: from the boom of modernity a hundred years ago, the meteoric economic rise in the 50’s, 60’s, and 70’s, to the ubiquitous technology and connectivity of today. All of these things have affected the city, and have also left a kind of shadow on the people who live here.” Ellingham’s photos were on display in Tokyo earlier this year. But if you missed the show, he continues to sell limited edition prints. You can get in touch with him on Twitter , Instagram or Facebook .

It’s for this reason that Iwasawa eventually decided to pack up and move to the country, a decision that would go on to influence her otherworldly paintings of insects and vegetation. After graduating from Tama Art University, Iwasawa worked at a design studio, and also tried her hand at designing kimonos. But unable to resist the call of the wild, she moved out to the countryside where she spent 10 years waking up with the sun to toil away at the soil and raise vegetables. Eventually she lost the battle against “a wild, untamable natural world” and decided to express her adoration and bewilderment towards nature through paintings. “Nature is full of thrills and wonders,” she says. “It impresses me to no end and fuels my imagination.” But rather than merely depicting what’s in front of her eyes, Iwasawa attempts to paint what she calls “the awe inspiring power of nature.” Indeed, her paintings are like scenes from some surrealistic dream: imaginative bold colors and realism, yet somehow transcending what’s before our eyes. Iwasawa received Honorable Mention in the 2017 Ronin | Globus Artist-in-Residence Program , for which Spoon & Tamago was a judge.

Japan seems to excel at this in areas like robotics technology , and indeed, the term “uncanny valley” itself was coined in 1970 by a Japanese roboticist, Masahiro Mori. Iwasaki takes this concept out into nature, blurring the line between flesh and wood.  Over the past 25 years, Iwasaki has been crafting these sculptures as part of a collection he simply calls “torso.” The sculptures themselves are life-sized at around 180 centimeters tall, or 5 feet 9 inches and made entirely of driftwood the artist collects in various locations in Japan. No one sculpture is exactly like another which makes them all seem like individuals with their own quirks and personalities. Descriptions of Iwasaki’s sculptures by viewers run the gamut from scary, unsettling, and imposing, to profound, intriguing, and otherworldly. Iwasaki’s driftwood sculptures have been exhibited in installations both in Japan and abroad. They have been featured in solo and group exhibitions in the Tokyo area for the past 25 years, and in 1996, a collaboration with fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto was included in that year’s Florence Biennale in Italy. A bit more recently, Tokyo-based indie rock band The Back Horn used Iwasaki’s driftwood sculptures for the cover of their 2008 compilation album .

To celebrate 160 years of sake making using local Itoshima rice, the company decided to design a new addition to their complex of old buildings to create a visually diverse structure that functionally connects to the rest of the factory. Most of the existing buildings in the site were very old and traditional with the main building being over 100 years old. “The purpose,” explains architect Taketo Tashiro , “was to obtain more space and to add new facilities to enhance the quality of their product.” The new addition is a modern, concrete structure that heavily emphasizes the texture of concrete throughout. The lack of windows in the space, other than the staff room and washing room, is intentional as exposure to sunlight can harm the product. Its triangular form was also designed to be consistent with the silhouette of the traditional building.

Because this pop-up restaurant had an inclusively-driven mission, and had hired waiters with dementia and Alzheimer’s. The premise of the pop-up restaurant, which was in a trial period from June 2 – June 4, 2017, was that the staff who have dementia may get your order wrong. But if you go in knowing that, it changes your perception about those who suffer from the brain disease and it makes you realize that with a little bit of understanding on our part dementia patients can be functioning members of society. Mizuho Kudo , who attended the event and tweeted about her experience, wrote that they went in and ordered the hamburg but got gyoza dumplings instead, which was really funny. She also noted that the younger waiters were full of smiles and seemed to be having a lot of fun. The restaurant was the brainchild of several like-minded folks including Maggie’s Tokyo , the Japanese reincarnation of U.K.-based Maggie’s Centres .

The talented craftsmen at SAMURAI AGE are doing their part to honor samurai tradition with handmade, high-quality samurai armor for you and your pets. One of the selling points of this Fukuoka-based brand’s armor is how lightweight it is. Unlike traditional samurai armor, which could sometimes weigh over 60 pounds, SAMURAI AGE’s pet armor is constructed from light plastic that they claim can be worn for long stretches of time without tiring out its wearer. So although your pet will probably not be protected from any katana strikes, they will at the very least feel both badass and comfortable. When not in use by your dog or cat, the armor can be repurposed in other creative ways.  Human-sized armor for adults and children is also available for purchase, as well as helmets and bottle covers. All items are made of the same materials as the pet armor. The website suggests wearing the armor for birthdays or special occasions, but given the stylish, lightweight material there’s no reason not to wear it on a regular basis, too. For those interested in a more “casual” look, SAMURAI AGE offers samurai helmets fashioned from polyester baseball caps. Customers can choose helmet designs based on those worn by famous Japanese historical figures such as Tokugawa Ieyasu, Oda Nobunaga, and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.","post_categories":["Industrial Design"],"post_tags":["pets","samurai"],"date":"June 6, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Haunting Photographs of Japanese Vending Machines at Night","content":"Vending machines in Japan were first introduced in 1888 and sold cigarettes. But their proliferation has been astounding and the country now has an estimated 5.5 million vending machines nationwide. Its penetration rate is the highest in the world with roughly 1 vending machine for every 23 people. In fact, they’ve become so ubiquitous and common that they blend in with Japan’s landscape. Maybe that’s why it takes an outsider to shine a light on them. In 2012 German photographer Benedikt Partenheimer visited Japan on a residency program and captured, among other things, a series of eerie photographs of vending machines quietly glowing at night. Devoid of any human behavior, it felt as though the machines existed alone in some post-apocalyptic world. The work was presented in an exhibition at the Hara Art Museum in 2014. “You can find them on almost every street corner,” says the artist. “Especially at night they become a visible reference of energy consumption and likewise emanate an absurd surreal and sad beauty.” In the wake of Japan’s Fukushima nuclear disaster and the ongoing debate over Japan’s energy policy, Partenheimer’s work was meant to raise public awareness on energy usage. “Japanese vending machines [as a total] consume about as much energy as one nuclear power plant produces,” says the artist. “Do we need all the machines we create and do we want to live in a world that is becoming more and more ‘convenient’?” It’s worth noting that Japan continues to make progress in energy efficiency. And vending machines in more populated regions of Japan are consistently swapped out for newer versions. In 2014 Suntory announced that it had developed a vending machine that consumes roughly half the electricity of its conventional counterparts .","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["Photography","vending machines"],"date":"June 6, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Katsutoshi Yuasa: Winner of the 2017 Ronin | Globus Artist-in-Residence","content":"Woodblock printing is one of Japan’s most well-known and traditional arts. At its essence, it is one of the most fundamental means of communication. But when Katsutoshi Yuasa first encountered the technique as a 3rd year art student, he sensed not the past but the immense future possibilities of the technique. Born in 1978 and based in Tokyo, Yuasa is a contemporary woodblock print artist who merges digital and analog technology to create his works. It was announced last week that he is the winner of the 2017 Ronin | Globus Artist-in-Residence Program for which Spoon & Tamago is one of the judges and media sponsor. Part printmaker, part photographer, Yuasa captures his own digital images and then transfers them onto a woodblock. He then carves the details of the photographs using a series of small carving knives, a process that can take several weeks. Once this is complete, the artist uses an entirely manual process to transfer the print onto paper. In a world where images both beautiful and ugly, terrifying and relaxing, are relayed to us in almost real-time, Yuasa finds meaning in spending weeks creating a single image. When we’re unable to properly filter the images that bombard us they become events in some alternate reality, stripped of all materiality. And so for the artist, his process becomes a method of resisting the movement of time. If woodblock printing embodies the fundamental essence of communication, then for Yuasa his woodblock prints are the ultimate social media. Yuasa will be invited to New York this summer for a residency program sponsored and supported by Ronin Gallery and Globus Washitsu . At the end of the residency the artist will stage a solo exhibition at Ronin Gallery in New York.

It is these mounds that inspired the design studio nendo to punctuate the plaza with a series of mounds that functioned as a cafe and retail space, information kiosk, play area for kids, outdoor stage, and meeting space. Whereas the cofun themselves are typically covered in grass shrubs and blend into the environment, nendo’s mounds outside the station were made from precast white concrete that makes the resemble flying saucers.

It’s a ‘ambiguous’ space that’s entirely a cafe, a playground and a massive piece of furniture, all at once.” If you’re planning to visit, be sure to allocate some time to exploring the new plaza.

In an interview in 2015 Dentsu Director Yoshihiro Yagi , who has been spearheading the campaign, explained that the idea was conceived in the wake of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami because the best way to support the region was to get people to go there. Now, the campaign has won Japan’s top tourism poster award. “There must be something we can do,” Yagi recalls saying. This eventually led to the campaign slogan Get Back . The posters, now in their 7th year, have largely remained the same in concept and typically feature minimal but powerful photos of trains with the slogan in small, bold letters. At the bottom of the poster, in small font, it reads “You can’t meet by e-mail. Meet on the rails.” Since 2016 the campaign the photographs have emphasized the geometric properties of the infrastructure like bridges and tunnels that support the trains. The Winter 2016 photo (above) is one of my favorites, and almost looks like a painting. But they’re all real photographs with very little digital retouching. “If you look closely some of the trains are quite dirty,” said Yagi, but they were intentionally left that way. Yagi does stress the difficulty and dangers of photographing trains though. The photos were all taken during normal operating hours so safety was a top priority. The crew had to camp out in locations for whole days taking photos each time a train would pass by. The campaign has won various international advertising awards over the years like the Cannes Lions and the One Show awards.

His signature motif is a deranged, smiling (but also sometimes frowning) sun with a mouthful of teeth that reminds you of the Cheshire Cat. After growing up in Japan, at the age of 20 Yoshi47 moved to California for several years where he studied break dancing and graffiti culture. It was in the Bay Area where his love for the outdoors also grew and he became an avid bicycler and surfer. At one point in his career Yoshi47 got swept up in the world of bike-riding and almost lost interest in making art. It was a serious accident and a fractured shoulder that literally knocked him off his path. His long road to recovery eventually re-ignited his career as a productive artist. But his passion for exploration and the great outdoors is apparent in his work, which includes murals, acrylics, watercolors and installations. But whatever the format, Yoshi47’s paint brush seems to go on its own adventure, sometimes spiraling out of control. As an artist, Yoshi47 has collaborated with brands like Stussy, Kidrobot, Starbucks and Jansports. But this year he’s been preoccupied with his own work, and is preparing for an ambitious dual-exhibition . One of his primary muses is human greed and desire.

Such was the case for designer Keiko Otsuhata , who was thinking about pigeons one day when the word “hato-heel” jumped into her head. Hato is Japanese for pigeon, and, while acknowledging that it’s rather weak as a pun, she began imagining what hato-heels might look like, and whether or not she could camouflage her feet as pigeons.

Fans of Studio Ghibli films have long asked for a Ghibli Theme Park. One artist even created a detailed rendering of what a hypothetical Tokyo Ghibli Land might look like. Finally, it appears that actual plans have been put into motion. But don’t get your hopes up too much. The plans are calling for Aichi Memorial Park , the former site of the Aichi expo, to be renovated into Ghibli Park. In the past, the location has hosted a Ghibli Exhibition in 2008 and a Ghibli Retrospective in 2015. And back in 2005 they even built a replica of the old farmhouse that appears in My Neighbor Totoro. This structure, it appears, will serve as the backbone for Ghibli Park. Rather than a theme park that pulls together multiple different films (as more ambitious fans like myself have dreamed of) Ghibli Park will expand on the Totoro Farmhouse and transform 200 hectares of land (roughly 500 acres) into various recreations of locations that appear in My Neighbor Totoro. So rather than “Ghibli Park” it’s going to be more like Totoro Park. I’m not complaining, but I can’t help but feel a little disappointed.

That’s the idea behind Sony’s new toy for kids, designed to inspire a future generation of robotics engineers. Toio is the result of 5 years of research into developing a toy that’s simple enough for kids to use, but also sophisticated enough to create a figurative sandbox where kids can explore the inner-workings of robotics engineering. Toio, at first glance, is stunningly simple: the core of the toy is just 2 white cubes with wheels. But don’t be fooled by their appearance. The tiny cubes pack a whole lot of tech. They respond to motion, are able to detect the exact location of the other, and can be programmed but also remote controlled. It would seem that the possibilities for toio are endless, which is why the developers teamed up with various creatives and designers to come up with various craft sets that help kids explore what robots can do. You can create your own robotic beast and battle others, you can play board games with them and you can make obstacle courses for them to go through. Sony has even teamed up with Lego for this project, allowing kids to build Lego structures on top of their robots. But one of the most attractive features is a craft set designed by the folks behind the lovable PythagoraSwitch TV segment. It’s a simple paper set that encourages kids to join the two white cubes using paper. The cubes then interact with each other and come alive, resulting in different movements. Check out the videos to get a better sense of what toio can do. Sony has released a limited quantity of toio sets that start at 21,557 yen (about $200 USD) and go up to 33,415 (about $300 USD) depending on how many craft sets you want to add on.","post_categories":["Interactive/ Technology"],"post_tags":["Kids"],"date":"June 2, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Music Monday: Frederic","content":"Frederic is a Kobe-base band formed around twin brothers Kenji and Koji Mihara.

Inspired by this tradition, media artist Etsuko Ichihara decided to create a modern-day version of the Namahage specifically for Tokyo, and unleash in onto the streets of Shibuya, Harajuku and Akihabara. In the traditional Japanese ritual, men would dress up in demon masks and parade through town, visiting houses along the way. They typically yell phrases like “Are there any crybabies around?” or “Are naughty kids here?” But the Namahage have been known to admonish adults too. And by acting as a scary rule enforcer, Namahage played the important role of strengthening family and community ties.

The younger cousin, born in 1990, was living with and caring for his Grandmother, born in 1928. With over 60 years between them, they had done everything together. The grandmother had been there for every important day. “I grew up basking in the love of my grandmother, so it’s only normal that I care for her until her death,” the cousin told Yoshida. Yoshida snapped a few pictures of the unusual pair and when he got home and was looking over them he was struck by an odd sensation. “Photographs have this special quality – like a filter – that allows us to objectively view things in new light that we may have gotten used to seeing,” said Yoshida in an interview . And it was around this time that he started taking periodic trips up to see the couple and photograph them. “Images of the two holding hands while shopping in the supermarket, seeing one another off when one went out, watching until the other is out of sight, eating and sleeping together” – Yoshida decided that he would document this relationship until the grandmother passed away: an end that didn’t seem too far away. But fate would have different plans for the cousin, the grandmother and Yoshida’s photo-documentation. One day in 2014 the cousin disappeared. There were no signs and no explanations. Calls and emails wouldn’t go through. Friends hadn’t seen him. For a whole year the grandmother, often by the window , waited for his return. Then one day they received a phone call. The cousin’s body had been found. He had taken his own life. He was 23 at the time. The grandmother was devastated and, one year later, as if chasing after her grandson, she quietly passed away. Yoshida underwent an internal struggle over whether or not to release the photographs. The cousin and grandmother enjoyed being photographed, and had given Yoshida permission to enter and document their lives, but now things had changed. In the end, Yoshida decided to move forward with the project and open up a dialogue with his photographs, which “gently shows us the irreplaceable warmth of everyday life that, although now gone, certainly existed.” Yoshida’s work is also a testament to the possibilities and limitations of photography. It’s a poignant reminder of what the lens captures, and what it doesn’t.

Once you select which fisherman you want to receive your wake-up call from, you’ll be directed to a questionnaire where you’ll be asked a few simple questions like name, phone number and when you want to be woken up. And don’t worry: the fisherman aren’t going to try and recruit their callers. But the organization behind the service hopes that by creating direct links and connections between the fisherman and younger generations it will lead to more people taking an interest in the fishing industry.

In front of Ota station’s North Exit is the newly opened Ota Art Museum & Library . Ota isn’t exactly a popular tourist destination. Primarily a manufacturing city, its neighbors include the car manufacturer Subaru, Mitsubishi Electric, Ajinomoto and Kikkoman factories. With just a little more than 200,000 people the city isn’t huge either. And while about 10,000 people get on and off trains at Ota station every day – until recently the area in front of the station was deserted – most residents go shopping in the suburbs. As part of a project to revitalize the city center, officials decided to build a culture center in front of the station. How exactly this would look like was developed in a workshop lead by the architect Akihisa Hirata , along with local citizens participating in the workshop to develop the concept for a building that would serve both as library as well as museum The library/museum finally opened in April 2017. But it wasn’t without controversy. Back in 2015 plagiarism allegations emerged over a proposed logo that had been designed by Kenjiro Sano, the now-notorious designer of the scrapped Tokyo Olympics identity. Citizens urged the museum to find a new logo, which they did. It was created by Atsushi Hirano. The white walls and big windows make the building very welcoming – but once inside the building is somewhat like a maze. You can sit on one of the wide staircases, read books or study. There is a slope called “the path of learning” ( ) which is part of the building’s library. The building has three entrances leading you to different parts of the building. The one on the ground floor faces the station and is directly connected to the in-house café. The entrances on the second and third floors are connected to the exhibition space and library parts of the building. Not to forget the terrace, where you can enjoy the books outside (should the weather allow) – or the rooftop garden from where you can see the ancient , a megalithic tomb from the Yayoi period, and the remains of .

Tsutsui Tokimasa Fireworks specializes in small, handheld sparklers and are one of only three other Japanese makers of sparklers. Their handmade sparklers are so beautifully packaged you might not want to burn them, especially in the dark. Among the lineup of products at Tsutsui Tokimasa you’ll find animal-themed fireworks like a dragon and a whale. You’ll also find your standard hand-held sparklers like the ones you might see sticking out of a birthday cake. Then you’ll find the (literally, incense fireworks), an extremely delicate yet beautiful Japanese firework. Once lit, they start off as a small, shivering red ball. They pitter and patter a bit before suddenly blossoming into a flower of sparkle. But you have to hold them still or the tiny red ball will detach and fall to the ground and you will be sad. Tsutsui Tokimasa explains that their senko hanabi are made with just 0.08 grams of gunpowder, which has to be expertly inserted into the handmade washi paper. Even 1/100th of a gram difference can make or break the sparkle. They also explain that these sparklers are meant to be aged like a fine wine, which is why they come in wooden boxes that keep out moisture. Use some up this summer but then put away the rest and keep them for next summer. Want to learn how to make fireworks? Tsutsui Tokimasa offers periodic workshops in their a detached space that neighbors their gallery and factory where they’ll teach children and adults how to make their very own fireworks.

But when it comes to the service industry, one design detail that often gets overlooked are the staff uniforms. But this is expected. After all, it’s not a fashion show. The customers are meant to be at the center stage while the staff quietly orchestrate. But behind many great experiences are the people that make them happen. And behind many successful uniforms in Japan is fashion designer Naoki Takizawa . Takizwa got his start at Issey Miyake in 1982. After climbing the ranks, he became creative director from 1993 to 2006, during which time he was responsible for producing Steve Jobs’ iconic black turtleneck. In 2010 he spent a year at the helm of Helmut Lang and then joined Uniqlo in 2011 as Design Director. But there’s an interesting anecdote about Jobs’ black turtle neck that also speaks to Takizawa’s design philosophy about company uniforms. And it also helps explain why corporate uniforms are more common in Japan. In his biography, Steve Jobs talks about going to Japan in the 80s and visiting a Sony factory. Here is the actual quote from his biography : Takizawa maintained his own separate design office, where he’s created company uniforms for museums, restaurants, hospitals and, his latest, train car attendants. For Train Suite Shiki-Shima he created all the staff uniforms from train conductor and engineer with Summer and Winter variations for each (a total of over 20 different uniforms). The uniforms were inspired by the Tohoku region of Japan where the train will traverse, but each is also the result of studying the different movement patterns required for each job. Lacquered buttons from Miyagi prefecture and braided cords from Aomori finish off the outfits. But when it comes down to it, “the most important things is that the working staff feel comfortable,” said Takizawa . Functionality informs the shape; the design follows.","post_categories":["Fashion"],"post_tags":["Fashion","trains"],"date":"May 17, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Think Small: A Solo Exhibition of Sculpture by Takeshi Miyakawa","content":"The Brooklyn-based Japanese designer Takeshi Miyakawa currently has a solo exhibition at John Doe gallery, also in Brooklyn.

For thousands of years pickles have quietly played their role as side-dish but I don’t think I’m alone in admitting that I’ve often enjoyed them as a main dish, along with a bowl of white rice. But when designer and foodie Tomonori Tanaka tried his hand at making pickles last year he found it harder than expected. For one thing, the plastic pickle-making containers ( here’s an example of one) were too big and wouldn’t fit in his small refrigerator. And the twisting lid made it hard to apply downward pressure evenly. And it was ugly. In short, pickle-making tools hadn’t evolved to be compatible with his lifestyle, so Tanaka decided to design his own. The Picklestone launched on Japanese crowdfunding site Camp Fire last week. And it’s everything a modern-day pickle-maker would want. Simply add your vegetables and pickle brine (typically salt, chili pepper, and konbu kelp) to the jar and slide the cypress wooden lid over the vegetables.

But if island hopping isn’t your thing and you prefer a more laid back style of sightseeing, consider Guntu , a new floating hotel that will begin operating within Japan’s inland sea in September, 2017. The vessel will be equipped with 19 guest rooms, a gym, a beauty salon, lounge and bath, as well as a café/bar and dining room & sushi bar where chefs will serve up freshly caught fish and specialties with ingredients procured locally. You don’t have to worry about planning where to eat, where to stay and how to get there because Guntu does it all for you. The peculiar name actually comes from a small blue crab found locally that would get caught in fisherman’s nets. They were a favorite among chefs not for their meat for their great flavor they would add to broth. Designed by architect Yasushi Horibe , Guntu incorporates plenty of warm wood into its design. Particular consideration was given to the scenery and so each room has splendid large windows and a patio that guarantees views of the sea and many islands you will pass by. 1 night to 3 night cruises will be offered. The cruise will begin and end at the BellaVista Spa & Marina in Onomichi, Hiroshima but depending on the season the vessel will travel different routes. It won’t dock at any island in particular. Instead, a smaller tender boat will transport guests back and forth between their floating hotel and then many islands.

Using the abundance of clear, spring water from the town of Yuasa he began producing a type of miso that he had learned about on his travels that had been used to preserve vegetables. A byproduct from this process – a liquid that collected in the barrels of the miso paste – was soy sauce. And this is how the town of Yuasa became the birthplace of Soy Sauce .

You can almost smell the rich, fermenting flavors of soy sauce waft out of the screen. After originating in Yuasa, Soy Sauce is thought to have made its way to Kansai, where it became popular. In fact, there is documentation of a large 18,000 liter (about 4800 gallons) shipment of soy sauce from Wakayama to Osaka in 1588.

And the astounding level of detail that can go in to some of Azuma’s backgrounds can render them as standalone works of art. In a 2014 interview , Azuma talks about realism vs cartoonish characters saying that “I lean toward realism, but at the same time, it’s not like I’m trying to make things actually realistic – what I’m going for is more like having a somewhat strange character within a realistic world. Now, that’s pretty standard in manga, but what I’m aiming for is to strike the right balance of being ‘somewhat’ strange – not too out there, but not too normal, either.” Indeed, the technique has been around for a while.

In one of the 2nd floor galleries, an expansive space is filled with spherical pods that are reminiscent of the architectural displays of Kawakubo’s retail shops. Inside these pods are approximately 140 examples of Kawakubo’s creations from the early 1980s to her most recent collection. Each are organized not chronologically but by different themes, colors and expressions. “I like to work with space and emptiness,” is one of Rei Kawakubo’s more famous quotes. And the exhibition offers this interpretation (even though Kawakubo herself hates to be interpreted): in their wildly exaggerated silhouettes, Kawakubo’s dresses can be read as Zen koan poems that meditate on the essence of mu (emptiness) and ma (space). Kawakubo is a very private figure and has been reluctant to explain her work. In a rare interview with Andrew Bolton, curator in charge of the Costume Institute, she began by saying “I hate interviews.” And after declining many exhibitions, she finally agreed to stage this one at the Met because, at age 74, she wanted to create a model for people to refer to after she is gone.

It’s “a new way of communication in a city where people from different cultures with various personalities intermingle.” The latest iteration occurred in Tokyo and was recently on display at 3331 Arts Chiyoda as part of a group exhibition that focuses on a specific art movement known as Socially Engaged Art (SEA).

The Bambi Chair was inspired by the happy, relaxed look on a child’s face while feeding a deer in Nara. Peace of mind can be found in co-existing with animals. While its most basic function is to provide one with a place to sit, chairs can be more than just a piece of furniture and perceived as more than just a means of alleviating physical weariness. A futuristic pharmacy located in close proximity to a nearby hospital in Japan. The more advanced medicine is the more trustworthy it becomes; true peace of mind is reached when the medical care is at its Cutting Edge and this project is meant to promote that image. Nakka is a Japanese restaurant located in the city of São Paulo.The inspiration for Nakka’s second location was to provide more meeting spaces, such the grand bar, while also offering Zen like atmosphere, as can be found in the hanging bonsai gardens. This measure is made by the world highest level of metal cutting technique. Its Φ 48mm disc-type shape is curved out from the aluminum, and its top and bottom surfaces are slightly concave to fit the fingers. There are three holes on the edge that you can put your favorite keychain, strap & etc. We would love to see people stop buying plastic bottles. But that’s not going to happen anytime soon. A more realistic solution is to design plastic bottles so that they look beautiful and consumers would want to keep them or re-use them. For these bottles, which are sold only online, the water itself becomes the protagonist of the design. The Artoletta project was launched with the idea that putting art on a pure white canvas will yield a splendid toilet environment. Because toilets are cleaned often, these vinyl composite films can be applied and easily removed and are the result of 3 years of intensive research and experimentation for mapping techniques and composite films. Algorithms were developed that allowed works of art, illustrations and photos to be wrapped around toilets without distorting the image. This nursery school in Sakura, Chiba was planned to accommodate 60 pupils. The overarching concept for the plan started with an idea: “a nursery school is a large house.” Surrounded by mountains and forest, the southern area of the site rests on a gentle slope. Putting this topography to use, the architect designed the school room to resemble a large set of stairs. Gift packaging for cakes inspired by the piano, an instrument that creates beautiful harmonies from the combination of each individual key’s sound.

Or Maybe you’re just looking to simplify your life? Well now you can do so in style thanks to a collaboration between architect Kengo Kuma and Snow Peak , a Japanese manufacturer of outdoor goods. Snow Peak has multiple retail outlets throughout Japan but the latest is opening on April 20 inside the brand new retail complex Ginza 6 . To commemorate, the brand will begin taking order for Kengo Kuma’s trailer home “ Jyubako ” on that day. Jyubako (住箱) literally translates to “living box” and is a play on homonym (重箱) for the stacking boxes used to serve festive meals. Kuma’s Jyubako has been in the works for a while. He originally conceived the idea for a mobile home during a trip to the Sahara Desert when he was a graduate school student. Since then he has distilled and perfected his concept. It’s now taken the form of a minimalist rectangular box made from hinoki plywood. When all the windows and doors are closed it can look simply like a large block of wood. The standard model is priced at 3.5 million yen, which at today’s exchange rate is about $32,000 USD. It can be customized with electrical outlets and LED lighting for an additional cost. Owners must park the mobile home on private land but Snow Peaks will also let you park it on any of their 3 camp grounds across Japan.

The Japanese first settled there in the Liberdade district in 1912 and has since grown to what is estimated to be 1.5 million. Now through May 7th, everyday a fleet of 30 flower bicycles created by Japanese botanic artist Makoto Azuma will ride through the streets of Sao Paulo passing numerous iconic sites – including the Liberdade district where it all began – and giving out flowers to people along the way. Part performance art, part installation, the 30 “ flower messengers ” – all of Japanese descent – cycle around the city highlighting the many stages of plant life cycles. The project “is an interruption in the city’s nervous flow, with a completely entertaining and inspiring message,’ says the Japan House Sao Paulo , who commissioned the project. “Suddenly that place that was empty yesterday is filled with flowers today. Soon they disappear, but they remain a memory.” Japan House was created by the Japanese government as a point of diffusion of all elements of genuine Japanese culture. Two other Japan Houses are being built in Los Angeles and London but the Sao Paolo location will open in May, just as Makoto Azuma’s flower messengers comes to a close.

The strenuous task – one that all children in Japan face – is typically accomplished only by rote memorization: writing the characters over and over and over again. But an unlikely savior has recently emerged in bookstores across Japan: poop. In March of this year, book publisher Bunkyosha released 6 series of kanji learning books titled “ Unko Kanji Drill .” Unko is the Japanese word for poop. It comes out of your butt and it stinks. If there’s one thing that all kids can agree on, it’s that poop is funny. So by incorporating potty humor into learning, the creators set out to make kanji learning fun and hilarious, instead of boring and tedious. How exactly do they incorporate poop? For starters, the weirdly likable mascot Unko Sensei guides you through all the exercises. In each, you practice the kanji first and then there are 3 example sentences that incorporate both the kanji and poop. That’s right: the publishers came up with a total of 3018 example sentences all about poop. And they really are quite hilarious. Above is a page for the kanji 取 (take) and 集 (collect). Here are the example sentences for 取: Silly? Yes. Popular? Absolutely. Within the first month the Unko Kanji Drills have reportedly sold 630,000 copies, which is unheard of in the educational publication industry. And over on Amazon , where they’re available for 1058 yen (about $10) each, the series has mostly 4 and 5 stars. “I bought these for my 2nd grader,” wrote one reviewer. “As expected, he’s been having a lot of fun reading the examples and has been more motivated to practice his kanji.” “My child is laughing out loud,” wrote another 5-star review. “It’s great that learning can be so funny.” They did note one drawback: you can’t use them to study in public, like on trains or in libraries, because there’s too much laughter involved.","post_categories":["Graphic Design"],"post_tags":["kanji","poop"],"date":"April 20, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"The 3 Million Yen MUJI Hut, Coming this Fall","content":"A year and a half ago, MUJI revealed plans to begin selling huts: small, humble abodes that would allow users to enjoy the simple pleasures of life, anywhere they wanted. They commissioned 3 notable designers – Naoto Fukasawa, Jasper Morrison and Konstantin Grcic – to create concept huts. But in the end, they decided to go with a design that borrows from each. Simple but spacious, the MUJI Hut offers a 9.1 sq m (about 98 sq ft) living space and 3.1 sq m (about 33 sq ft) patio. The company says that’s “a space large enough for 3-4 people to relax in,” which seems a little tight to me but it could easily work for a couple. But the materials and craftwork is where this utilitarian hut really shines. The exterior is all , burnt cedar wood which has been traditionally used in Japan for its durability and antiseptic properties. In fact, all the wood used to make the hut is sourced from Japan. The floor is reinforced concrete with a raft foundation to ensure that your small home won’t blow down or get soaked during storms. For 3 million yen (about $27,000 USD), MUJI will construct this hut for you on any property you own. The price includes everything but work permits and other legal fees you may incur, depending on the location you choose. (However, they’re limiting it to only Japan) MUJI will begin selling the huts this fall but in the meantime they’ll be offering several viewings. The first one is coming up on April 29 – May 7 where the MUJI Hut will be on display at the Shirahama School House in Chiba (registration required).

But something doesn’t feel right in this room, like it’s a set. Suddenly, a gigantic hand reaches into the frame, revealing that the room was indeed a set built entirely in miniature form. The chopping board is maybe the size of a pinky; the knife slightly smaller. This is the world of Japanese miniature enthusiast and YouTuber ‘ Joken ’ aka AAAJoken , or triple-A Joken. Currently a member of the YouTuber management agency UUUM , Joken got his start by introducing toys for kids and creating stop motion animations using those toys. But since 2014 he’s created over 200 videos on a YouTube channel called Miniature Space . In it, he creates all kinds of miniature Japanese meals like and , but also everyday foods like spaghetti carbonara and corn dogs. The channel currently has over 1.2 million subscribers. And many of the videos have views in the hundred-thousand range; some in the millions. It’s hard to verbalize what exactly we find so mesmerizing and satisfying about these videos. (Heck, we even have a sub-category dedicated to the art of miniatures.) Kelley Kitely, a mental health expert based in Chicago, suggests that control is behind our undeniable appeal for things shrunken to a fraction of their normal size: “It can give you a sense of control when we’re able to fit an entire scene into what feels like, the palm of our hands,” she explains. But for me, another joy comes from imagining the meticulous planning that goes into each set. And then seeing the creative substitution that is also required. For example, in his tempura video Joken substitutes shrimp with sakura shrimp, a species that grows to about 4-5cm. In his okonomiyaki video he substitutes cabbage for its miniature equivalent: a single Brussel sprout. Of course then again there’s the other theory: tiny things are just damn adorable.","post_categories":["Interactive/ Technology"],"post_tags":["food","miniature"],"date":"April 25, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Journey Through 100 of Japan’s Finest Gardens","content":"Marc Peter Keane in an American landscape architect who spent almost 20 years in Kyoto practicing landscape design.

The building houses a small gallery that counts among its collections various obscure pottery work and paintings as well as a glass-enclosed sculpture of a Buddhist deity made from roughly 20,000 beetles in numerous varieties. If you have any form of entomophobia or insectophobia I suggest you don’t read on. The sculpture was made almost 40 years ago in 1978 by a man named Yoneji Inamura, who was in his 50s at the time. We recently learned that Inamura had passed away earlier this year in January at the age of 98, which is what prodded us to look into his work. Although Inamura created several sculptures out of beetles, he spent 6 years in the 1970s constructing this one, which has become his masterpiece and the largest sculpture he ever made. When it was done he donated it to the city. The sculpture, made from rhinoceros beetles, winged jewel beetles, drone beetles, longhorn beetles and other types of local beetles, depicts the (1000-armed bodhisattva), a popular Buddhist deity in Japan. Inamura first took an interest in beetles during his days working for the local railroad. Located in a rural area of Japan, beetles were abundant and one day he took note of how the rhinoceros beetle’s horn resembled the fingers of the Buddhist deity. And so he began collecting beetles – before work, during breaks, after work – and adding them to his sculpture . “If I shaped them into the form of a Buddhist statue it would also serve as a memorial to the insects.” The Itakura Town Hall is a little difficult to get to (as in, you’ll probably need a car) but it’s open to the public if you would like to see this mesmerizing sculpture for yourself.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["buddhism","bugs"],"date":"March 30, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Rebranding Spoon & Tamago as Spoon & Tomato","content":"2017 marks the 10th year since we started this little blog.

I remember, as a 5 or 6-year old, being scared of them – they were so different from our other Japanese neighbors – but also mesmerized. The New York-based photographer Denny Renshaw was also attracted to them. Having grown up in Jackson, TN, the birthplace of Rockabilly, he felt a deep urge to capture them on film. But coordinating any type of photo shoot turned out to be impossible: they have no online presence and no formal contact info. So with only vague knowledge of where and when they meet, Renshaw packed his bags and flew to Tokyo. He recounts the incredibly odd experience of trying to make contact with them and get permission to shoot, on the Harmony Blog : These portraits were captured over 5 weeks in 2013 and 2015, shooting at parks, parties, bars and music venues. The Roller-zoku grew out of both 50s and 60s rock ‘n roll but also rockabilly because Japanese record labels at the time didn’t differentiate between the two, explains Renshaw. But it was the revival in the lat 70s that brought to life what we know as Japan’s Roller-Zoku. The groups are made up of both young and old, male and female. Their greased up pompadours and theatrical dancing can still be seen in Yoyogi Park on weekends.

Oversized hats were having their moment on the heads of high society women despite complaints that they were obtrusive. But how can a hat really be while still being, well, a hat? Japanese architect Kosaku Matsumoto decided to try and find out. Matsumoto collaborated with Japanese hat maker Japan Braid Hat to create “ The Hat’s Limitation .” The company is known for their sanada hats, which are woven seamlessly together and are completely jointless. Utilizing their knowledge and technique, Matsumoto was able to create a hat 5 times larger than the standard, “stretching the technical limit of the craftsman, and extending the very definition of we can see as a hat.” The project was more of an experiment, and I don’t think the company has any plans to start selling this hat.

Roughly a 2-hour drive from Tokyo, it’s where urban wealth goes to play. Owning a home or vacation home in Karuizawa is the ultimate status symbol. Besides leaning towards the avant-garde (note that these homes are the exception, rather than the norm, in Japan) one trait that many of these homes have in common is that they are designed to take advantage of their mountainous surroundings by inviting the outdoors, in. One of the latest additions – a home for an art collector – is no different, but it’s exceptionally well executed. This home was designed by Megumi Matsubara & Hiroi Ariyama of the Tokyo-based studio Assistant . It was completed last summer and its title – “ It Is A Garden ” – says a lot about what the architects set out to do. Almost as if the home was designed entirely around the forest where it sits, it is defined by 5 large voids that are cut into the single-story home to make way for trees and vegetation. The voids, in effect, become the most important element of the home: courtyards, viewable from every room in the house, that blend the boundaries between interior and exterior garden. One of the best views of this home is from above, where one can fully appreciate the stunning angular forms of the geometric roof.

And some of the most memorable scenes are the meals, which are often simple – it’s likely that most viewers have eaten them before. But it’s those everyday meals that give so much depth to the characters and allow us to empathize with them. If you’ve never been to the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, out in the Western suburbs of Tokyo, now would be a good time to plan your trip. The museum is planning an upcoming, year-long special exhibition that will focus on the many food-related scenes from all of Studio Ghibli films. Meals and food play an incredibly important role in almost every Studio Ghibli film. In Laputa, Pazu splits his egg on bread in half and shares it with Sheeta. By doing so, the two become closer. In Spirited Away, Chihiro eats an onigiri and gains the courage to face her uphill struggle. In Howl’s Moving Castle, the characters become like family when they surround a dinner table over a meal of eggs and bacon. Taberu wo kaku (which roughly translates to Drawing Eating) begins May 27, 2017 and will be on view through May 2018 so you’ll have plenty of time to see it.

Now there’s a better – shall I even say more ‘Zen’ – way. Some Japanese homes keep a pair of slippers in the lowered area between home and door specifically for receiving packages or greeting visitors. But Tobiishi replaces those ugly things. Borrowing its name from the stepping stones found in Japanese gardens, Tobiishi “creates a designated, comfortable & clean spot to temporarily step upon, so you can answer the door effortlessly.” Made with a slip-resistant base, Tobiishi was designed by Tokyo-based British designer Duncan Shotton , the creator behind the soy shape and other whimsical ideas.

After one of the most adorable remediation and recovery efforts, the Tengu has now been repaired. Located outside Kurama Station in Kyoto, and part of the local Kurama-dera temple, the large Tengu and it’s 2.3 meter (7.5 ft) long nose was a popular mainstay. But in January 2017, heavy snowfall accumulated on the nose, causing it to break off . The Tengu was quickly treated with first-aid and a large band aid (fashioned out of iron) was placed over the nose. A small sign reading “under medical treatment” was placed next to the Tengu. In March, once the snows melted and winter was behind them, local officials began repairing the broken nose. It was reinforced with wire and received a brand new coat of red paint. And on March 24th it once again greeted temple-goers looking strong and stoic.

Crests ( or in Japanese) are still in use today. But while many Japanese know their family’s crest, not many own an item with their crest on it. All in all, crests are no longer present in daily life. The only time you’re likely to see a is when attending a Japanese wedding – men wear formal kimono called (“with crest”). Or go to a Rakugo performance – actors will wear kimono with their master’s crest. A wide range of motifs can be found on , mostly taken from nature: animals, birds or plants. In medieval Europe, only nobility was allowed to bear coat of arms. Things were a bit different in 16th century Japan where only samurai were allowed to have surnames – a crest was a way to distinguish yourself from others, distinguish your shop, your brand. Even people at the bottom of society, such as vaudeville actors or courtesans had their own . Sometime in the Muromachi period (1336 – 1573) when samurai started to wear their family crest the profession of was born: Craftsmen who paint onto kimonos. Since they painted mostly on request by textile merchants or kimono shops – only trading business-to-business, the profession was not widely known. Hatoba Shoryu , a 3rd generation , says that today there are 50,000 different . He is one of the few remaining who do not only paint but also design crests. As they are no longer widely used, rather than sticking to his trade and painting only on kimono, he ventures out and actively seeks to collaborate with artists, artisans and even brands of all different genres. Recently he designed traditional curtains hanging in front of the COREDO shopping complex’s electronic sliding doors in Nihonbashi. He also recently collaborated with the Kleenex brand on a high-end line of tissues . Originally used : bamboo compasses to draw the But thanks, in part, to the son, Hatoba Shoryu recently began incorporating Adobe Illustrator into his process. In the first part of this short video produced for Design A ,an NHK children’s program, you can see the traditional bun-mawashi method – soon followed by an example of how Illustrator helps him to design new today. For the 50th anniversary of the popular anime Lupin the Third, the department store Isetan asked Hatoba Shoryu to design for the characters of the anime and turn them into a series of drinking glasses and badges. Each design incorporates typical items for the characters: the mon for Lupin the Third, the master thief, includes the two Kanji for “the Third”. The first kanji of his adversary’s name, Inspector Zenigata, ( specifically refers to a “round coin with a square hole in the center”) has become Inspector Zenigata’s mon. Today, Hatoba Shoryu also takes in requests from abroad – shops or individuals who want their own family crest provide him with specifications – on engraved in glasses, on kimonos or if you have an extra million Yen at hand, on a chest of drawers.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["craftsmanship","history"],"date":"March 27, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Ukiyo-e Inspired Manner Posters for Seibu Railway","content":"Last year Seibu Railways launched a new poster campaign to educate their straphangers on proper train etiquette and manners.

The photographer and long-time resident of Japan takes anachronistic photographic portraits that document what is perhaps one of the oldest fashion shows in the world. Indeed, Brown’s contemporary photographs, part of a collection called “ Japanese Samurai Fashion ” were taken last year. They capture the people of Soma, Fukushima, who carry on the 800-year tradition of the annual (“Wild Horse Chase”) ceremony in which residents dress up in traditional samurai costume. “One of the things that distresses me about living in Japan,” says Brown in a TED Talk he gave, “is the historical amnesia that I find in a large number of Japanese people. So many important memories – many beautiful, others horrifying – are being forgotten.” When Brown traveled up to Fukushima prefecture after the March 11 disaster to connect with people who live there he met Michitane Soma, the 34th generation head of the Soma warrior clan. It was then that Brown discovered the wonderful tradition these samurai descendants were keeping alive. Brown was given access to photograph 44 Soma residents wearing traditional samurai costume. Using wet plate collodion photography and advanced digital techniques Brown captures the rich cultural tapestry of samurai fashion with a deep insight into each of the individuals. “It was more important to center themselves in their 800-year-old samurai tradition,” writes Brown, “than to succumb to the changing winds of time.” Brown’s photographs were recently on display at hpgrp gallery in New York, as well as the Art on Paper fair.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["history","Photography","samurai"],"date":"March 29, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Toshiaki Hicosaka’s Newspaper Sketches of Ocean Waves","content":"Toshiaki Hicosaka’s latest project comes at a timely moment. During a 2-month residency in 2016 the Japanese artist created daily newspaper sketches of ocean waves in a tribute to Japan’s first newspaper, but also to journalistic democracy and knowledge. The story begins in 1850 when 13-year old Hicozo Hamada was on a sightseeing ship that got caught in a storm. He was adrift in the Pacific Ocean for roughly 2 months when an American merchant ship rescued him and he ended up in San Francisco. Nine years later Hicozo, who had assumed the name Joseph Heco, returned to Japan as an interpreter. Having learned that Japan was still under the sakoku seclusion policy, and being partial to American democracy, Hamada was intent on showing Japan the rest of the world and spreading the notion of democracy through the newspaper medium. In 1864 Hamada started Japan’s first newspaper, the , by translating newspaper articles obtained from sailors. The Japanese painter Toshiaki Hicosaka (who coincidentally has a similar name to Hicozo) was inspired by the grandfather of newspapers in Japan and one anecdote in particular: while on the American ship Hicozo had encountered a sailor’s journal. He mistook the continuous lines of cursive for “sketches of ocean waves.” So the painter decided to “re-enact this experience of misunderstanding.” Hicosaka struggled to strike the perfect balance between tracing words and tracing ocean waves, noting “the difficulty of drawing without being partial to one or other of these two types of focus…is similar to the way in which it is difficult for one’s body and its perceptions to avoid automatically imposing its own pre-existing ideas or understandings on everything encountered.” It’s a visually stunning project that implores the viewer to explore questions and possibilities about history and knowledge.

The new Onagawa Station opened in 2015 and was built on elevated land roughly 150 m (500 ft) inland from where it previously stood closer to the water. The 3-story structure was designed by architect Shigeru Ban, who also contributed his designs to temporary housing structures nearby in the wake of the tsunami. Prior to the earthquake there was a public hot spring situated next to the train station. It was a beloved spot where locals would come to bathe, eat dinner nearby, and then come back for one more soak before returning home to sleep. Ban incorporated this bathhouse into the design for the station, allowing for the entire 2nd floor to be dedicated to the hot spring. Now, you can visit Onagawa Yupo’po as soon as you get off the train. But to create something extra special for the locals, who lost so much in 2011, Ban invited artist Hiroshi Senju to contribute artwork to the bath tiles and Senju agreed to take on the job pro-bono. Japanese public baths typically feature murals of Mt. Fuji so visitors can look at the mountain while relaxing in the hot spring. So Senju painted Mt. Fuji in his own style, and also over trees and deer to accompany the men and women’s bathing areas. In the lobby is a large piece called “Family Tree.” Also painted by Senju, it features over 900 different flowers that were sent in as submissions from around the country.

Oni appear in classic Japanese stage dramas of Noh, in Japanese fairy tales and as characters in popular anime. But sometimes you have to look a little harder; you have to look up, onto peoples roofs to find oni. – literally “oni-tiles” – are roof tiles that are affixed to the end of the roof ridge. They’re not only for decoration, but also to control rain water. And while gargoyles are found in medieval European cathedrals,  oni-gawara differ in that they were meant to keep evil away, rather than illustrate it. Today, oni-gawara are most commonly found on the top of old buildings  and temples. But one company is trying to revive the ancient craft. Today’s pre-fabricated houses might not allow for a traditional-tiled roof, but oni can protect a house and its inhabitants in a different way. Shinto Ltd. commissioned nine (artisans specializing in making oni-gawara) to create tiles that can be mounted to walls, or simply placed on top of shoe dressers at entrances. These smaller, more contemporary oni-gawara go for about 30,000 yen (about $265). Their compact size (9 x 11 cm or 14 x 20cm on a walnut plate) makes them ideal for putting around the house to ward off evil.

Responding to a call from Murakami, long-time collaborator and book cover designer Chihiro Takahashi came out of retirement to create the latest covers. (Don’t worry, there are no spoilers) In an interview with Casa Brutus , Chihiro Takahashi, who worked as the in-house book cover designer at publisher Shinchosha for many years and oversaw the design for other Murakami titles like 1Q84 and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, shares some insights into how the book cover for “Kishidancho Goroshi” came together. Takahashi had retired in 2014 but agreed to work on the book after a request from Murakami. He received the manuscript for Murakami’s latest novel in October of 2016 and began working on the design 4 months ahead of publication. Takahashi says that he typically doesn’t consult with the author and instead decides on the overall design before revealing it and making slight adjustments. “But with Haruki it’s a bit special.” Takahashi went to Murakami for the first suggestion “because I think Haruki-san already has an image in his head for the cover as he is writing.” One major difference between the original Japanese and the English translation (which probably won’t come for a few years) is that the Japanese version is published in 2 volumes (1Q84 was published in 3 volumes) and the cover is designed with distinguishing variations. Based on Murakami’s guidance, a simple sword illustration was created to grace both covers. They were created by illustrator Chikatsu Takeo , who used a western-looking sword for volume 1 and a Japanese-looking sword for volume 2. Both swords are imaginary but the western-sword is loosely based on swords used during the Crusades, as well as narrower fencing swords. The Japanese sword is based on swords from the Asuka period (AD 592 – 710). Takeo created the swords without ever reading the manuscript but had the idea to include a sheep’s head crest in the Western sword because “Haruki Murakami makes me think of sheep.” The author found this amusing and went along with it. The main title was a push and pull between a type and handwritten look. Because 5 out of the 6 characters are kanji it was going to have a very angular feel so Murakami wanted it to be more nuanced. But a fully handwritten font would make it too soft so they agreed on a modified font that was based on mincho-type. At the very last minute Murakami had the idea to slant the kanji 殺 (“to kill”). So they cut out just that character  and played around with different angles. Finally, Murakami picked an angle that he liked and they taped the paper down with scotch tape so that they could replicate it. “Murakami seems to really enjoy the process of book-making,” noted Takahashi. You’ll notice other handprints by Takahashi when you open the book. The pastedown in volume one is done in a forest-green tone. In volume two it’s a shade of reddish brown. This visualizes the storytelling, which begins in the season of new green and progresses through autumn and winter. Takahashi also came up with the chapter decorations. Taking his cue from a painting of a square, a triangle and a circle created by the Japanese monk Sengai Gibon (1750 – 1837), the book designer came up with an art deco-inspired motif.

But maybe one of the more unexpected is that it’s the 70th anniversary since burlesque dancing came to Japan. That’s right – in January of 1947 the first ever strip show was held in Tokyo’s Shinjuku district . And there’s a fascinating history, as well as vintage advertisements and documentation, that’s being showcased this month to remember the original tease. According to cultural critic and media communications professor Noboru Saijou, Japan’s first strip show wasn’t at all what we might imagine it to be. At the time, women weren’t even allowed to work so there was a lot of uncertainty around what they could and couldn’t do. So the first strip show, held at Shinjuku’s Teitoza theater, was called a (a “picture frame” show) and women would strike poses of famous nudes in art history like “The Birth of Venus” and “Perseus and Andromeda.” Because the strip shows were held in-between other comedy and literary performances they became associated with literary figures in Japan like author and playwright Kafu Nagai and comic fiction playwright Hisashi Inoue. The theaters gave birth to a generation of Japanese actors and comedians like Beat Takeshi and Kiyoshi Atsumi whose careers began in the strip show theater. The strip show theater went on to become a cultural phenomenon in Japan. One of the most well-known examples of comedians incorporating strip show culture into their act was Kato Cha’s skit (embedded above) in which he Boo Takagi are the wind and son, competing to see who can get the woman to remove her clothes. No matter how hot the sun would shine, no matter how strong the wind would blow, the woman wouldn’t strip her clothing. But then Kato has the idea to play smooth jazz music that was associated with strip shows and sure enough the woman begins to remove her clothing. A 70th anniversary commemorative event is taking place on March 18, 2017 at the Asakusa Toyokan in Tokyo. You can read about it more here and get tickets.

If you’ve ever eaten at a fancy restaurant in Japan you might have found a carrot carved into a bunny, garnishing your plate. But in the hands of Japanese artist Gaku , the art of fruit and vegetable carving is elevated to a new realm of edible creations.  One constraint to carving fruits and vegetables is that sometimes you must work fast. The moment a peel is removed, oxidization will start to discolor your artwork. So, depending on the variety, Gaku’s carvings are probably created within several minutes. Armed with a tool similar to an x-acto knife and a fruit or vegetable from the grocery store, Gaku carves intricate patterns that are often inspired by traditional Japanese motifs. Gaku points out that the banana is great fruit to practice with because it’s cheap and easy to carve.

Kitagawa’s father was a collector of odds and ends that dominated the living space. So the architect had made it his task to create shelving that would hold his father’s collection while also allowing it to ebb away into the background of their life – a type of harmony between lifestyle and object. Kitagawa worked primarily with IKEA’s KALLAX shelving units, which come in multiple models and configurations. And he got the idea to transform them into parabolic forms after draping duct tape from the ceiling, which drooped down to create the U-shaped orientations. “The parabolic shelf hanging from the ceiling makes contact with the floor while gradually squeezing the light entering through the window,” explains Kitagawa. “Shadows are created on the floor around the contact point, and the form is established structurally.” Kitagawa created a total of 3 of these floor-to-ceiling units in slightly different sizes, and oriented them differently throughout the apartment.

At least that’s what Hironori Yasuda will tell you if you ask him about his label CUNE , which he started in 1994. If anything, they’re “barely clothes,” he says. Yasuda isn’t swayed by trends. He makes what he wants, and each season he picks a seemingly arbitrary theme, one that typically has no place in the world of fashion, and designs his entire collection around it. He doesn’t think about who would wear his clothes, or how they would wear them. In fact, he even says “you don’t have to buy them.” But with two stores in Tokyo, one in Fukuoka and a thriving online shop, people seem to like his bizarre creations. His most recent collection last year was all about raw meat and a blue sky. We’re not entirely sure what those two things have in common, but we’ve learned not to ask. So there you have it.

In what is perhaps CUNE’s most bizarre collection, in 2012 the label debuted a line inspired by “the intestines and white of the eye.” It featured intestines in all shapes and sizes, but also eyeballs that emphasized the white part of the eye.

In some European countries, it’s just a day the flower shops are decorated with hearts trying to persuade you to buy flowers. Not so in Japan where, if you are romantically inclined, it’s one of the most important days of the year, on par with even Christmas. Chocolate as a food associated with passion and romance is rooted in Mesoamerican history. But Richard Cadbury is largely credited with the commercialization and gift-giving aspect of Valentine’s. Valentine’s Day in Japan is an entirely different beast though. For starters, it’s women who give chocolate to men and the men (typically) reciprocate a month later on White Day. This tradition was originally started in the 1950s when chocolate manufacturer Mary’s started selling heart-shaped chocolates at Isetan Department Store and suggesting that women give to men. Today, the idea has taken on extraordinary dimensions – every supermarket, every convenience store has a space dedicated to Valentine’s chocolate. DIY-inclined teenage girls all over the country spend the nights before Valentine’s Day in their family kitchen trying to produce cute chocolate sweets – not only to boy-friends or prospective boy-friends ( ), but also for their female class-mates ( , or friend-chocolate). For women working in a company, male colleagues expect to receive : chocolate given away because you feel you have to. With close to half of the working population involved, you can imagine how big this day is for the chocolate industry. A 2016 article suggests that the economic impact of Japanese Valentine’s Day is at one hundred billion Yen (about 880 million USD). And each year new industries seem to want to get a share of the Valentine’s craze. So we put together a few that are being marketed this 2017 season. The convenience store Seven Eleven is selling their Valentine version of the popular snack or pork buns. Only of course the are not round, but heart-shaped – and are not filled with pork, but – you guessed it – chocolate.  Traditional Japanese sweets – “wagashi” – are also joining in. Toraya, a wagashi shop which was founded in the 16th century in, is not known for chocolate but for yōkan. Yōkan is made of adzuki beans and agar-agar, a block-like sweet using chestnuts (kuri-yōkan) or sweet potato (imo-yōkan). In the Edo period yōkan was one of the luxury items that only few could afford in the big cities. For Valentine’s Day 2017, Toraya has two special yōkan on sale. One of the least likely players in the Valentine’s chocolate industry are instant noodles. But last month Maruka-Shokuhin, the company behind the ever popular “Peyoung” started selling “Peyoung Chocolate Yakisoba Giri.” After a food scandal in 2014, the company now is in the news for exploring new tastes (The cilantro version was actually rather tasty). Although not officially marketed as a Valentine’s Day treat, it can’t be a coincidence that the experimental KitKat Chocolatory is opening their first street-level retail space in early February. And to commemorate, they’re going to be giving away what’s being called the world’s first KitKat Sushi. But don’t worry – there’s no raw fish involved. Using ingredients like raspberry for maguro (tuna), melon mascarpone cheese for uni (sea urhcin) and pumpkin for tamago (egg), the company has created 3 series of replica sushi treats that replaces the rice with a rice crispy treat-like base. They’re available from 2/2 – 2/5/2017 but only for the first 500 visitors who spend more than 3000 yen at the new Ginza shop ( Gmap ). For the more adventurous, the ever-playful Village Vangaurd is selling chocolate curry (540 yen) that simply pours over rice, creating an instantaneous romantic dinner and chocolate desert in a single package. In Japan, the Valentine’s market isn’t limited to confectionery makers. It even extends to agriculture. In this case, a strawberry farmer in Yamaguchi prefecture is selling heart-shaped strawberries. The farm spent 4 years perfecting their ichigokoro (strawberry heart) and are selling them for steep prices: 1,270 yen (about $11) for a single medium-sized heart strawberry and 5000 yen (about $44) for a single extra-large strawberry. And of course it’s not only the food industry who wants their share of the cake, or rather the chocolate bar – for trainspotters the Izu-Hakone-Railway is running a chocolate-colored locomotive on February 12th 2017 between the stations of Mishima and Shūzenji. Adorned with a cute heart, the train will leave Daiba, Shizuoka at 9:47am to arrive at Shūzenji at 10:45 where it stops for about half an hour for fans to take photos and will then arrive back at Daiba at 13:05.","post_categories":["Food"],"post_tags":["food","Valentine"],"date":"February 1, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Kyoto Café Reimagines Rocks & Minerals as Beautiful Food","content":"Usaginonedoko is a Kyoto shop, café and lodge whose purpose is to convey the sculptural beauty of mother nature.

It just might be a delicate glass sculpture, at least if you’re in the presence of Yuki Tsunoda , a young sculptor who shapes glass into insects and plants that are almost exactly to scale. The 26-year old artist first began working with glass in 2012 when she attempted to visualize the disgust and aversion most people have to insects, especially when they swarm together. But as she studied them more and more she began to take note of the beauty of each individual body part. Tsunoda eventually shifted her focus to emphasizing the beauty of insects by recreating them in realistic forms, and to scale, using glass. Tsunoda works primarily with Italian Moretti glass, which is a medium-soft glass and is known for its malleable and colorful properties. But because she works in such miniature scale she often uses pins, small spatulas, razors and other tools around the house to create her sculptures. She also uses dichroic glass and a form of quartz known as aventurine to obtain the type of metallic luster often found on insects. Tsunada exhibits her work around Japan periodically but doesn’t appear to have any upcoming exhibitions. But she does have an online shop where you can purchase her glass insects. She is also on Twitter , where she occasionally shares images of her work.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["bugs","glass","realistic"],"date":"February 2, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Japanese Buildings that are Shaped Like the Things They Sell","content":"The other day we stumbled upon a building in Osaka that was shaped like a dachshund. As it turns out, it was a warehouse and distribution center for the Japanese pet food company DoggyMan, which made sense; what you see is what you get. But it made us wonder: what other novelty architecture is there in Japan in which buildings are shaped like the things they sell? Unsurprisingly, there are quite a few. And thanks to our Twitter followers who pointed us in interesting directions. Read on for some of our favorites. The aforementioned dachshund-shaped building was designed by Nikken and completed in 2011. It functions as DoggyMan’s warehouse and distribution center and is located in Osaka. It can be seen if you’re driving along the Hanshin Expressway No. 4 ( Gmap ). An outline along the roof lights up at night, allowing drivers to see the adorable shape even when its dark. Located along the Tokaido Shinkansen Line (and viewable as you’re pulling out of Nagoya Station) is the Kirin Beer Factory . The tanks are immediately recognizable because they’re painted to look just like a tall glass of beer: golden brown on the bottom with white foam at the top. If you’re actually in Nagoya you can also schedule a free tour and tasting! (They even have a hip-looking restaurant) In 2011 Meiji, known for their chocolate candy, decided to refurbish their first factory that was originally built in 1955. Since then it’s been a magical place for kids and the company wanted to instill that same magical spirit into their new factory. Given that the JR Kyoto train line runs directly south, Taisei Design proposed an idea that to make the entire façade look like a gigantic bar of chocolate that can be seen from the train. It’s 28 m high and 166 m long, which is equivalent to 38,000 bars of chocolate. If you want to visit , they offer free tours as well. In Okinawa there’s a bar and eatery known as the Barrel Restaurant. The real name is Taru Tonneau (taru means barrel in Japanese) and the shop is shaped like a gigantic whiskey barrel. It’s been around since at least 2012 but its website looks like it’s from the 90s. It’s one of the more wild novelty architecture designs we’ve come across but it certainly does the trick in announcing its business. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) technically doesn’t sell money. But they do issue banknotes, as well as implement Japan’s monetary policy. So it only makes sense that the old headquarters of the Japanese yen currency is shaped like the kanji for yen (円). But, like the previous examples, the BOJ building’s form isn’t immediately recognizable from the street. But thanks to google earth we were able to get a bird’s eye view, which reveals it’s yen-semblance. The BOJ building was designed in 1896 in a neo-baroque style by Tatsuno Kingo (who also designed Tokyo Station). It’s actually unclear whether or not the yen design was intentional. And there’s some confusion over whether the kanji for yen was even used back then. It’s true that the formal kanji for yen was 圓 and it wasn’t simplified to 円 until 1946. But a little digging reveals that Meiji government that emerged from the collapse of the Edo Bakufu established a formal currency in 1871, 25 years before Kingo designed the BOJ. And at the time they also designated 円 as the kanji. In addition, the BOJ building was constructed where a gold coin foundry was previously located. So although the evidence isn’t conclusive, we would like to imagine that Kingo foresaw satellite technology and gave future internet dwellers a gift to ogle over.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["Japanese architecture"],"date":"February 3, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Japanese Street Style Magazine FRUiTS to Shutter After 20 Years Citing Lack of Cool Kids","content":"After 20 years of capturing the street style of Japanese teens in and around Harajuku, Japanese magazine FRUiTS says it has published its last issue.

In an interview with Fashionsnap , founder, editor and chief photographer Shoichi Aoki said that the main reason his monthly magazine was shuttering after 20 years and 233 issues was that “there were no more fashionable kids to photograph.” Aoki says that over the years he had noticed the trend of declining cool kids that met his magazine’s standards, and that the trend particularly intensified last year. Aoki’s publishing company will continue to publish their last remaining title STREET, but their other title TUNE is currently on hiatus. This trend is in sync with anecdotal evidence we’ve heard and seen about the rise of Uniqlo and how kids are no longer spending money on fashion.

I never thought I would say that, and it still feels weird that they look forward to watching an ancient (at least for them) form of Japanese comedic storytelling. Rakugo originated in the 9th and 10th centuries by Buddhist monks who sought to make their sermons more engaging. Rakugo as we know it today was formed around the mid-1800s when the word, which literally means “fallen words” began to be used more commonly. If it existed in the West it may very well have been called sit-down comedy. In rakugo, the lone storyteller sits in the middle of the stage and relays a comical story that lasts much longer than your typical joke: usually 20 – 25 minutes. No props are involved, other than a small paper fan and cloth, so the comedic effect is entirely reliant on the storyteller’s verbal delivery, which can involve related skills like gestures, pantomiming and verbal sound effects. But because of its length – who has the patience for a 20-minute story nowadays? – and relative monotony the art has fallen out of favor, especially among younger generations. One survey from 2015 found that 52% of Japanese had never even seen a single Rakugo performance. And the figures are higher when broken out into those in their 10s and 20s. But a new television show on NHK is breathing life back into the art form by approaching it more visually. Cho-nyumon! (“super-introductory”) Rakugo The Movie began as a pilot series last year – once in March and again in July – and was popular enough to be picked up as a regular program in October 2016. We first saw it late last year and were immediately hooked. Cho-nyumon! Rakugo The Movie begins with actor and host Gaku Hamada, who sets the stage for 2 rakugo performances. Each begins as any other: the performer comes on stage and begins telling the story. But a short ways in the screen cuts to a reenactment of the story featuring real actors and comedians on set and in costume for what appears like a period drama. What becomes immediately clear, and remarkably impressive, is that the actors are lip-syncing the original performer’s voice as they go along. Cynics may dismiss the attempt at visualizing rakugo as untrue to the original art form. But by adding a lip-synced reenactment of the story it feels as though the entertainment value has increased while the essence has been preserved. It’s certainly a joy for me and my kids to watch. A recent episode (embedded below) featured the stories (“rice pot thieves”) and (“2nd brew of tea”). NHK has also posted the original performances without the reenactments. : thieves are stealing rice pots throughout town so one owner decides to sleep inside his and catch the thieves in the act. He gets drunk though and drifts into a deep slumber. The thieves carry off the pot while he’s still inside. Eventually he awakens and opens the lid but the thieves have already run off and he’s inside a rice pot that’s sitting on a pathway. “They’ve made off with my house!” exclaims the man. : a group of fire wardens return from patrolling the neighborhood on a cold night. Although not allowed, they decide to start drinking sake and disguise it by pouring it from a tea pot. A government official unexpectedly visits and questions the contents of the teapot. The crew explain that it’s a medicinal tea but that they’ve run out. “Fine,” says the official, “brew up a 2nd batch and I’ll have some.” Rakugo does require some basic Japanese language comprehension in order to fully appreciate it. But the stories are loaded with cultural tidbits (like the tradition of niban-senji) that learners will find educational and fascinating. If you’d like to try out the real deal, there are two major venues in Tokyo: Suehiro-tei in Shinjuku and Asakusa Engei Hall . Both cost about 3000 yen but Suehiro-tei has a late-night show every other Friday from 9:30 – 11:00pm that’s only 500 yen. Don’t speak Japanese but still want to test out the rakugo waters?

Raw fruits and vegetables are one of the last un-touched frontiers of food but even that is changing with genetic modification.

It’s almost like a railway version of Laputa. The large camphor tree is older than most records but officials believe it to be around 700 years old. The story of how this tree and station became, quite literally, intertwined, varies depending on who you ask. It certainly has to do with a great reverence for nature, but also a fair amount of superstition. Kayashima Station first opened in 1910 and, at the time, the camphor tree stood right next to the station. For the next 60 years the station remained largely unchanged. But an increase in population and overcrowding began to put pressure on the station and plans for an expansion where approved in 1972, which called for the tree to be cut down. But the camphor tree had long been associated with a local shrine and deity. And when locals found out that station officials planned to remove the tree there was a large uproar. Tales began to emerge about the tree being angry, and unfortunate events befalling anyone who attempted to cut it down. Someone who cut a branch off later in the day developed a high fever. A white snake was spotted, wrapped around the tree. Some even saw smoke arise from the tree (it was probably just a swarm of bugs). And so the station officials eventually agreed to keep the tree and incorporate it into the new elevated platform’s design. In 1973 construction began and the new station was completed in 1980. The station even surrounded the base of the tree with a small shrine. To this day, the tree still stands thanks to a strong, local community and a little bit of superstition.

In Japan’s Nikko region there exists an artistic tradition known as : (sometimes called ) meaning single-stroke and meaning dragon. It’s a technique, passed down from generation to generation and kept tightly in the family, of creating the flowing, river-like body of the dragon in just a single stroke. The artist will typically begin by creating a detailed depiction of the head. Once that is completed the artist moves on to the single-stroke-body. Here, the large brush slowly traverses the canvas, making gentle twists and turns, never once being lifted up until the body is complete. Later, the artist goes back and adds details like whiskers and claws. The current proprietor to the tradition is claimed by Fumiko Takase, the 3rd in the Takase Family .

An attractive young woman stepped off the sturdy boat with glass windows, but was unable to communicate in Japanese and eventually the locals returned her and the ship back to the sea. A number of 19th century Kawaraban-newspapers recount very similar versions of the legend. The three most well-known are (Tales from the Rabbit Garden, 1825), (Counts of Drifters, about 1835) and (Dust of the Plum, 1844). The accounts are very detailed in what happened – down to the clothing of the young woman: she was carrying a white box and was wearing velvet trousers. Today, opinions differ on what that “utsurobune” (hollow ship) actually was – some say her saucer-shaped boat was a UFO. Others say that the woman was a European washed ashore a Hitachi beach, maybe even a European trying to spy on Japan, which had cut off contact with the rest of the world at the time. Yet others claim it was a goddess landing on earth. Or maybe it was an Edo-Japan fake news story… ?

The Iwase Bunko Library in Aichi Prefecture stores the original description and has a video which details the account. The Mori Art Museum always does a great job items from the art on display into merchandise at the shop and “The Universe and Art” is no exception. Next to a t-shirt, the museum sells a thermos bottle in green and white with a little utsuro-bune as well as the mysterious woman on it, made by the Swiss manufacturer SIGG. But for conspiracy theorists and fans of the occult the most sought-after item is the donburi rice bowl, a perfect match given the uncanny resemblance between the mysterious utsuro-bune and a rice bowl.

Located in the Sangenjaya neighborhood of Tokyo, a small, unassuming café opened on January 5, 2017. Inside Tokyo Saryo is a minimal, rectangular, wooden counter that sits upon a cement base. Nine wooden stools surround it. Here, visitors can experience what is being called the world’s first hand-dripped tea service. Much like a hand-dripped cup of coffee, sometimes referred to as a pour over, the proprietors have developed a beautiful apparatus that is filled with tea leaves. Hot water is poured over the leaves and drips through the ceramic barrel and into a cup. For 1300 yen you get to compare two different varieties of green tea. The service, the proprietors claim, is superior to green tea made in a pot because it achieves the optimal balance between water temperature and extraction rate. Accordingly, they’ve developed a method that strikes the perfect balance between sweetness and bitterness. Did you know that the optimal brewing temperature for green tea is 70 – 80 degrees ℃ (as opposed to the 90s for coffee)? And did you also know that, unlike coffee beans, green tea leaves are meant to be brewed a 2nd and 3rd round? Pay Tokyo Saryo a visit and you’re guaranteed to learn more about green tea than you thought you needed to know. 1-34-15 Kamiuma, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo ( Gmap ) Hours: 11:00 – 20:00 Closed Mondays and holidays","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["green tea","tokyo guide","tokyo guide relax"],"date":"January 10, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"2017 Ronin | Globus Artist in Residence Program","content":"Following a highly successful inaugural year , the 2017 Ronin | Globus Artist-in-Residence Program is back!

Indeed, it was a fantastical combination of all 12 zodiac animals. Now, Japanese artist Feebee has created her own interpretation, and has produced it in the same technique as it was made in around 1850. Feebee’s creation is titled “A beast called Kotobuki – bird-“ (2017) and is created in her unique style of using vivid colors and excruciating detail to render fantastical beasts. This time, however, instead of painting she collaborated with the Adachi Foundation for the Preservation of Woodcut Printing . If you were thinking about becoming a member, now’s your chance because Feebee’s woodblock print comes as a membership reward (20,000 yen, or about $170). A special bonus to Feebee’s print: instead of sending different zodiac New Year’s cards each year, you can just send this one every year. Below are 2 fascinating videos that show the production process of the woodblock print.

One of the main drivers that pushed me to become an architect was my childhood experiences playing with stacking blocks.” That’s Kengo Kuma , one of the most significant Japanese figures in contemporary architecture and the one who is creating the new Tokyo National Stadium , which will be the main venue in the 2020 Olympics. Any architect will tell you that, structurally, a triangle is the strongest geometric shape. Kuma has taken this wisdom and rendered it into a playful and interactive building set called Tsumiki , which literally means wood stacking in Japanese. Satisfyingly smooth to touch, each piece is crafted with Japanese cedar. Nifty notches cut into the tips of each block allow them to nestle atop the other. They make great building blocks for the inquisitive mind, offering a range of creative possibilities no matter what their age. Tsumiki stacking blocks come in sets of 7, 13 and 22-piece sets and starts at $75. The product was developed in collaboration with More Trees , a forestry conservation organization founded by the musician Ryuichi Sakamoto. All their wood is sustainably sourced Japanese cedar from Miyazaki Prefecture and is certified by a Japanese forest stewardship council. More Trees returns a portion of sales to help sustain Japanese forests, creating a healthy cycle of wood usage.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["Kids","shop"],"date":"January 12, 2017"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Out of Bounds: Meguru Yamaguchi’s Collaboration with Issey Miyake Men","content":"The New York-based Japanese artist Meguru Yamaguchi has collaborated with fashion brand Issey Miyake Men, installing a series of artworks in the Ginza storefront and also creating a series of garments with his signature brushwork.

It’s 70s Japanese folk meets tropical indie rock. Within months since their formation in late 2014 the band began pushing out singles and then released their first full album “Yahsinoki House” in May of 2015. It was a solid album with psychedelic and tropical undertones. And yet, it didn’t quite sound like the group had found their own sound. Within a year the band matured a lot and, in June 2016, they put out their 2nd album “fam fam.” It was still folky, still tropical and they still had their slacker vibe. And yet they felt all grown up. Below is a live clip of them performing in mid-2016.

The top 10 list this year is a diverse mix of subjects that range from geography and horticulture to traditional craft, music and photography. I’m proud of each and every one of these articles, but I can also say that I’m proud of all the articles we chose not to write. “Fake news” was on the mind of many media publishers this year, and understandably so. But we stand by each and every article that we’ve published and I hope readers can take comfort in knowing that our stories, even though they’re about relatively lighter topics, are vetted for accuracy and truthfulness. 2017 will mark our 10-year anniversary of blogging! To us, that’s pretty incredible. And we couldn’t have done it without our readers so I wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you for stopping by and spending time reading. Look out for some fun projects next year to celebrate our 10th blogiversary! Our most popular post this year was a latecomer – published in October – that quickly catapulted to the top. This map, created by Hajime Narukawa, may very well be the most accurate ever. Narukawa has spent years improving on the conventional map, which has largely not changed since 1569. Read about what’s different with Narukawa’s projection , and why it’s ever-so relevant today. Hoshinchu, a Kyushu-based workshop, captured our fascination when they added a fun, poetic twist on indoor gardening. By utilizing the opposing forces of magnetic energy they created a levitating plant called Air Bonsai . Since then, we’ve seen countless imitation products and variations but we’ll always remember this small design studio as the original plant levitators. What happens when you take Tokyo’s vibrant, rich and sometimes overstimulating skin and apply it to other cities? That was the question that led Japanese architect Daigo Ishii to embark on his Worldwide Tokyo-lization Project.” The fascinating project takes elements of Tokyo and applies them to 6 global cities: New York, Buenos Aires, Copenhagen, Paris, La Paz and Venice. Japanese wood joinery dates back to the seventh century and is a craftsmanship technique that involves complicated, interlocking wooden joints that form bonds without the use of nails, screws or adhesives. A young Japanese man, fascinated by the techniques and aiming to preserve the dying art, began illustrating them and posting them to a dedicated twitter account. Hit songs sometimes take years to craft. But for comedian Piko Taro, all it took was an apple and a pineapple. Oh, and a pen. The utterly simple yet infectiously addictive song and dance became a viral hit that made Piko Taro famous practically overnight. Our article too , in which we reported on Pico Taro’s true identity, was one of the first and for a while was the top hit on google search, which helped secure its place at number 5 on our list. Thanks Google! Masayuki Oki is a master at catching the stray cats of Tokyo making funny faces, napping and even sometimes fighting. But whatever they’re doing when Oki snaps his shutter each is imbued with character and personality that is instantly relatable. His portraits of Tokyo’s stray cats are number 6 on our list. The Kouraku Kiln was founded in 1865 and has been producing ceramics for the past 150 years. Over that time the facility accumulated a vast collection of pottery that has, for one reason or another, gone unsold. So the warehouse decided to offer visitors a unique treasure-hunting experience to try and get rid of some of their stock. For just 5000 yen, visitors could rummage through their vast warehouse and take home whatever they found! We later heard from the kiln that swarms of visitors had come thanks to our article which, in our mind, is one of the greatest compliments. In addition to being an architect, Tomoyuki Tanaka is also a master draftsman. And his painstakingly-produced, hand-drawn cross sections of major train stations in Tokyo are a work of beauty. If you’ve ever visited Tokyo, Shibuya or Shinjuku Station, you’ll appreciate these sketches. Following in the footsteps of ukiyo-e artist Hiroshige, Shinji Tsuchimochi spent 3 years illustrating 100 views of Tokyo. Each view is a unique work of art, inspired by ukiyo-e but produced with a modern sense of whimsy and, sometimes, surrealism. After our initial article on him, we reached out, offering to carry his book in our shop of he ever decided to make one. Less than 6 months later the book was stocked in our shop , and it became our best-selling product of the year. Fumihito Taguchi, a record shop owner in Tokyo, took an avid interest in the unique, portable record players that were mass-produced in Japan in the 60s and 70s. His collection of over 100 different varieties was the 10th most popular post on spoon & tamago during 2016.

Running an online shop, and doing everything in-house, poses several challenges, as we’ve discovered. But it enables us to reach out and form relationships with our favorite artists, makers and designers and be the bridge between them and the world. That gives us so much joy and is what keeps us going. With that said, here are the top 5 products we carry that our customers loved the most. Our original blog post about illustrator Shinji Tsuchimochi’s 3-year project made it into our top 10 blog posts for the year. And the completed project, which was turned into a lovely book , was our most popular product for the year. We were honored to be able to work with Tsuchimochi and the fantastic folks at Shikaku Publishing to be the international distributor for this beautiful compilation of drawings of our favorite city. The Papa’s Maze is what originally kick-started our little shop 3 years ago, and it continues to be one of our most popular products. Created by Kazuo Nomura over 30 years ago, the hand-drawn maze was unearthed by his daughter when she was going through the attic. Later, at his daughter’s request, Nomura created another version of his intricate maze which is also equally popular. Created by one of our favorite designers Norihiko Terayama, the Awaglass is a mesmerizing hourglass that replaces sand with bubbles. But don’t try and measure time. Its purpose is actually the opposite: to obscure and help you forget about time. Unlike uniformly shaped sand, large bubbles and small bubbles pass upwards at different speeds. You’ll get lost in this piece’s simple, poetic beauty. Technology is increasingly replacing the need for hand-written letters. And it’s also making the tiny stars in the sky harder to see as cities get brighter. But maybe that’s why our Starry Sky Envelopes are so popular. There’s still a way to light up the night sky, and show someone you care, all with one poetic envelope. Coming in 5th is another old-timer, the floating ripple vase designed by our friend Taku Omura. Cast from plastic resin, the ripple-shaped dish holds just a single flower and can be floated in almost any dish. The conventional flower display is a stationary one – grounded by a heavy vase or bottle. But the ripple vase changes this, allowing for a much more natural display of flowers. It’s as if the flower was blown into a small pond by the wind.","post_categories":["Industrial Design"],"post_tags":["most popular"],"date":"December 23, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"The Wintry Elegance of Hasui Kawase’s Woodblock Prints","content":"Hasui Kawase (1883-1957) was a prominent landscape artist in 20th century Japan who travelled extensively throughout the Western regions of the country.

And it’s often the most mundane of items that have the greatest impact. For Shunsuke Tani , a young biologist major-turned childcare specialist, it was spare change that was lying around his house that became one of his greatest passions. Specifically, Tani primarily uses 1 and 5 yen coins, the lowest of denominations, and the occasional 500 yen or foreign currency coin, to create stunning, gravity-defying sculptures that, at any moment, look like the could come tumbling down. And indeed they do. To prove to skeptics who, understandably, claim he uses glue or some advanced form of computer graphics to render his creations, Tani occasionally shares videos of his sculptures falling down. It’s a painful moment that stands in stark contrasts with the hours of time and patience required for assembly. Tani posts his creations to a twitter account where he often shares how much time each sculpture took to create (usually 2 – 3 hours). He also adds some self-deprecating humor like “I have no other skills in life, other than this” or “I sacrificed 2 hours of my life.” According to an interview , Tani originally began stacking coins about 4 years ago. The inspiration came from the simple act of stacking a 10 and 1 yen coin had with him at the time. Tani’s art is a testament to the fact that even the most simple and ordinary can be honed to perfection.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["multiplicity"],"date":"December 29, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Kiyoto Maruyama: one of Japan’s last public bath mural painters","content":"If you’ve ever been to a , or a public bath in Japan, you may have noticed a large mural, typically one of Mt. Fuji. Most sentos are decorated with such murals on the interior, referred to as penki-e, and it’s common for them to be repainted at least once a year featuring Mt. Fuji in various forms. But with the decline of sentos the art of sento mural painting is also dying. Currently there are only 3 remaining sento mural painters left in Japan and, at age 81, Kiyoto Maruyama (yes, he has a website) is the oldest. The other 2 are Maruyama’s disciple and then a disciple to that disciple. According to a recent interview , Maruyama got his start in 1960 when he was working for an advertising agency. Indeed, sento mural painting has its origins in a type of low-brow advertising. Vendors would pay for advertisements to be painted on the walls of sento where town folk often went to rest their weary muscles. And the murals would be painted for free as an add-on. But eventually advertisements shifted elsewhere and sento mural painting gradually became a standalone art. During the heyday of sento murals Maruyama recalls working 6 days a week. Each mural took 3-4 hours, and a separate mural had to be painted in both the men’s and women’s baths. But now he paints roughly 2-3 murals per month. That’s because sentos are disappearing very quickly. The last time we wrote about sentos was in 2013 , at which point we noted that there were about 850 sentos in Tokyo. Now, according to government data, there are only about 650 (there are 4300 across Japan but Tokyo has the most). And less than 200 are decorated with murals. Here is a list of several Tokyo sentos that do have murals. Viewing Mt. Fuji is a common activity in the new year. But if you don’t have the energy, perhaps viewing Mt.

One by one he plants pins into his objects – a piece of driftwood or a flowering branch – and then connects the tip with twine to create, what he calls, additional “exterior crust” of polygons.

Located in Hiroshima, and completed just 3 months ago in September of 2016, the museums and gardens elegantly merge traditional and contemporary design. The vast campus is dotted with interesting architecture like a 17th century hall that was relocated from Shiga prefecture, a teahouse originally designed by tea master Sen no Rikyu and and newly built art pavilion by contemporary artist Kohei Nawa and his architecture studio Sandwich. Open to the outdoors, Nawa’s Kohtei pavilion acts as a museum dedicated to light. The ship-shaped building is covered entirely with wooden shingles that subtly reflect glittering lights and is Nawa’s interpretation of the teachings of Zen. A must-see at the museum is one of Japan’s largest collections of Zen paintings and calligraphies by Zen master Hakuin Ekaku. The collection features some of Hakuin’s most well-known pieces like “Daruma,” and “One-Eyed Daruma,” which formed the basis of many of his teachings. In Zen, all daily-life activities, including having meals and bathing, are regarded as an opportunity to practice Buddhism. At Gokando you can enjoy a meal of Shinshoji udon noodles; at Shuroken, a tea ceremony room that follows the Omotesenke school, tea with sweets; at Gakui, the 17th century hall, a café serving tea, sweets and yudofu. There’s even a bathhouse where, for an additional fee of 800 yen, visitors can cleanse themselves both physically and spiritually. From Hiroshima Airport Shinshoji Zen Museum & Gardens is about a 50 min drive. But it’s closer from Fukuyama Station, where you can grab a taxi or a bus that will get you there faster.

Browne’s latest series titled “juxtaposes Japanese Buddha statues with mindsets and fixations of contemporary life.” But Browne’s work is equally about idolizing as it is about our desire to be idolized. The Buddha with the stickers could be interpreted as a generation of people enforcing their own ideals onto preexisting faiths, or simply the Buddha putting the stickers on himself. The schoolgirl Buddha too: many in Japan idolize schoolgirls but it’s hardly a one-way street with many young people accepting, and even encouraging, the artificiality that’s projected onto them.

An 11.5 foot-tall Rube Goldberg Machine has been installed in the center of the café. The contraption is made from 1450 pieces of wood and has 180 wooden keys that act as a xylophone. The device is activated by guests who visit the café and order a cup of coffee through Nescafe’s “ Barista i ” app. You also get to pick your current mood, which effects what type of Christmas song gets played. Your selection then triggers a ball that rolls through the contraption, hitting the wooden steps and triggering tongs that hit metallic keys, all to play a Christmas tune while your coffee is being made. The mug-shaped contraption is the work of Bascule , a Tokyo-based creative firm. It took 5 months to make and assemble using laser cutters and other technologies and is being called the world’s largest wooden rube Goldberg machine. It’s on display through December 25, 2016 at the Nescafe in Harajuku ( Gmap ). It reminds me of the Forest Xylophone ad that Docomo did a few years back. The creators at Bascule explained that many companies have an accumulation of customer data but don’t really know what to do with it. So Bascule’s big interest right now is, what can we do with that big data. In this case, the Rube Goldberg machine pulls user data (as it pertains to coffee) from all over Japan and uses that data to effect the style of music that’s played.","post_categories":["Interactive/ Technology"],"post_tags":["rube goldberg","video"],"date":"December 15, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Tokyo’s Shitamachi as Seen Through the Eyes of Illustrator Shinji Tsuchimochi","content":"Tokyo’s is reverse – “basically the opposite” of the vibrant areas of Tokyo like Shibuya and Harajuku that most people associate with the metropolis.

Three years ago he was living in Higashi-Nippori and was taking many photographs of Tokyo’s shitamachi. This led him to begin to draw the many scenes of local life that wouldn’t necessarily be chosen for postcards but were endearing nonetheless. In an episode for Toco Toco , Tsuchimochi describes how his passion for Tokyo’s shitamachi led to a 3-year project: 100 Views of Tokyo . In the episode, which recently aired on French TV, Tsuchimochi talks about wabi sabi, why he sometimes incorporates imaginary creatures into his work, and introduces some of his favorite spots like the Saboru café and Yamada Shoten, which carries old books but also ukiyo-e prints. Toco Toco, currently on episode 43, features Japanese creatives who introduce some of their favorite places in Tokyo. All their episodes are available on YouTube.

Most notably, the sisters wrote the opening track for the mega-hit drama Nigeru wa Haji da ga Yaku ni Tatsu, about a contract marriage. The track was slightly overshadowed by the even-more-popular ending song and dance, which has become somewhat of a phenomenon in Japan. But nonetheless, the show has catapulted Charan-Po-Rantan from obscurity to prominence. And fresh off of their success, the duo today released a new track called (“roar” in English).

Gatebox won’t be available until December of 2017. And when it does , anime lovers will have to pay 298K yen (about $2500) to live with Hikari Azuma, a blue-haired anime girl who will be able to recognize different patterns in your life and respond to them, like when you wake up in the morning or when you come home at night. She’ll even text you during the day with endearing messages like “I miss you” or “see you soon!” It’s unclear exactly how technologically capable Hikari will be but the promotional video indicates that she might be able to connect to your smart-home infrastructure and do things like turn on the lights before you get home. Gatebox taps into a certain Japanese male psyche made popular, in part, by the overwhelming success of “We Married as a Job” ( ), a TV drama series that just concluded last night with its finale. The story revolves around a male protagonist (he describes himself as a “professional bachelor”) and a female counterpart who enters into a contract marriage with him. The show, at least initially, portrays the unrealistic ideals of marriage that many bachelors in Japan assumingly dream of. Namely, an absurdly attractive partner waiting for you at home with a warm meal each night, no matter how late you get home. And all without the messiness of a relationship. In fact, there’s a near-identical scene in the TV series and the promotional video for Gatebox where the bachelor is approaching his apartment at night, looks up, sees the lights on, and smiles. In , as it’s shortened to, the relationship inevitably becomes messy. After all, the two partners are only human.

The largest and Westernmost of the five is Fukue Island. Fukue is the last place in Japan where you can see the sunset each day, and it’s blessed with stunning beaches and a beautiful church, a remnant from Christianity’s first entrance into Japan . But that wasn’t enough to boost tourism. Tomoyuki Torisu, a copywriter at ad agency Dentsu whose ancestors hail from the Goto Islands, wanted to do something. So he recruited architect Junpei Nosaku to renovate an 80-year old minka townhouse and convert it into a community center and library. The Sangosan Tomie Library opened this summer and it’s a beauty. The architects incorporated all sorts of local materials like a volcanic rock stepping stone that leads to the stairs and bits of coral embedded into the cement floor. The vermilion ( ) colored façade is an homage to the colors used for the islands fishing fleet, and a color that was often incorporated into local architecture. What makes the library special is that it is based on a donation program but with a specific set of guidelines. The library asks people to donate their “3 best books in the world,” as well as descriptions of why these are their top 3. Visitors to the library can access an intimate profile of notable contributors like college professors and manga artists who have contributed their top 3, but also locals like tour guides and farmers. The library also functions as a community center where you can relax, have tea and chat with others. There’s even an accommodation service that’s in the works. Fukue Island is accessible by plane from Nagasaki (30 min flight) or Fukuoka (40 min flight). You can also take a ferry from Nagasaki, which can get you there in 1.5 hours.

The loyal akita dog Hachiko, who was memorialized as a bronze statue, now stands outside Shibuya station where it waited for its beloved owner to return. But as media artist Teruaki Tsubokura points out, its fame is also its detriment: there’s only one Hachiko for the thousands of people who meet up there every day. Indeed, meeting up in Tokyo’s most-popular meet-up spot can be hectic and chaotic. So Tsubokura came up with a hack that utilizes augmented reality (AR) and Microsoft’s Hololens , which has the ability to project images that only the Hololens user can see. The Hololens is still in development, and is quite pricey, but Tsubokura created a mock-up video that imagines a world in which such devices have been widely permeated. When meeting up with someone, all you have to do is pinch the air in front of you to generate your very own Hachiko statue. It would be visible to you but also to the person you’re meeting up with. That way you would never miss each other. Tsubokura’s idea is of course only a prototype and is not available in any app store. And in all seriousness, meeting up at Hachiko really isn’t that bad. But the concept is really cool and we can imagine a whole lot of applications for this that might even be more useful, like finding your friends at a concert, or even finding a lost child.

And so the bujinga portraits were depictions of samurai warriors intended to capture the legacy of the brave and pass them on to future generations.  In a contemporary iteration, bujinga artist Masayuki Kojo captures characters from Star Wars, creating versions of Darth Vadar and the Storm Troopers like never seen before. You might recognize Kojo’s work from the popular manga Vagabond, Naruto or One Piece but he’s a 38-year old bujinga artist who has, in recent years, been sought after for his stylistic ink paintings that capture a certain strength and intensity of the subject. “Bujin does not refer to those who fight, but rather to those who await their destiny,” says Kojo , explaining the essence of his muses. And it’s with that same interpretation that Kojo is creating a series of paintings that depict the characters from Star Wars. The project consists of 3 different designs that will be reproduced 10 times by hand so each will be original paintings. Kojo will be selling the paintings for 198,000 yen each, or about $1,760.

But just as stated in Newton’s third law—for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction—so too did the people of Japan respond to the magnitude of the destruction in an effort to rebuild their country anew as captured in this staggering new artwork by Manabu Ikeda titled . Starting in July of 2013, Ikeda toiled away on the 13 x 10 foot piece for 10 hours a day inside a basement studio at the Chazen Museum of Art in Madison, Wisconsin. He finished work just last week. At its core, depicts a tree rising from the debris of the tsunami as enormous waves crash nearby, but a closer inspection reveals thousands of tiny details, the individual stories of anonymous people, plants, and animals as they fight for survival and try to return their world to a semblance of order. Ikeda says that in his work he seeks to replicate the beautiful chaos of life that rarely fits a simple linear narrative. Instead, everything crashes together and interacts in unknown and unexpected ways, an idea that applies directly to his process as he often doesn’t know what each day will bring as he works inch by inch on the near endless canvas before him. While Ikeda sketches broad details in pencil on the canvas beforehand, he primarily works with pen and acrylic ink using various forms of cross-hatching and brushwork to fill areas so dense with details, the true nature of the artwork isn’t revealed until staring at it from only a few inches away. Mountains of vehicles, gnarled tree branches, and train tracks sit tangled at the base of a tree, and flower blooms comprised of umbrellas and emergency tents fill the sky above. Everywhere a collision of humankind and nature, for better or worse. “My goal is to faithfully express my view of the world in my composition, but I don’t intentionally depict detailed images,” he tells the Chazen. “Because I see details when I observe things, rather than the whole, I find pen and ink to be the best tools to express how I see them.” Ikeda’s time spent in Madison wasn’t without its own adversity. The artist dislocated a shoulder in a downhill skiing accident which rendered his dominant hand temporarily useless. Unable to stop work for very long, Ikeda began practicing with his other hand and after 3-4 practice drawings continued work on unfazed. will be on view only briefly at the Chazen Museum of Art through December 11, 2016.

If you’re looking to participate, we’ve got you covered from North to South with  some of this year’s not-to-miss illumination shows. Japan’s very first illumination occurred in Sapporo in 1981. A modest 1048 bulbs lit up Oodori Park in 1981. But the northern city has come a long way since then. This year’s “ white illumination ,” taking place in the same spot it did 32 years ago, features 420,000 that culminate in “crystal river” of lights. The entire show runs on self-generated biodiesel energy. November 18 – December 25, 2016 Thought flowers were only for the spring and summer? Think again.

October 22, 2016 – April 9, 2017 (but special performances from 11/26 – 12/25) But for the absolute largest display of lights in all of Japan you’re going to have to head farther down south to Mie prefecture.

Sato went on to explain that design and manga actually have a lot in common: the overly-extravagant is difficult to relate to. Instead, the ordinary, everyday is much easier to become attached to. Last year a TV program paired him and manga artist Yusei Matsui, known for his hit manga Assassination Classroom , together for a series of talks. Sato and Matsui, who are both close in age – in their late 30s – and are accomplished in their respective fields, hit it off during their talks. They took turns visiting each others offices and learning how the other worked. Matsui explained how he comes up with an idea and then works backwards, thinking up story lines and plots that would enable his original idea. Sato described himself as an air conditioning filter that’s constantly letting air pass through while also collecting all sorts of dust and debris that he later sifts through. The two agreed that it was the way they took advantage of their weaknesses that led them to success. The pair later published their exchanges as a book , but the original episode is available above (in Japanese only). Sato names Fujiko Fumio’s as an early design influence. And in creating his 50 manga chairs for Friedman Benda gallery in New York this year, the designer drew on many manga styles. At the end of their interactions the two exchanged gifts. But the friendship didn’t end there. Sato has now created an entirely new desk “to meet the needs of a professional cartoonist who spends countless hours working laboriously at his desk.” The cartoonist desk was produced at the request of Matsui and the final design reflects the many intricacies involved in creating manga: partitions that allow for both deep focus but also collaboration, an adjustable shelf system, and a magnetic dust tray that prevents pools of eraser dust from accumulating under the desk.","post_categories":["Industrial Design"],"post_tags":["Furniture","manga","Nendo"],"date":"December 6, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Hermes Japan’s Gorgeous Pop-Up Shop Within an Old Gion Machiya","content":"Last month Hermès, the French luxury goods maker, appeared in Kyoto along Gion’s historic Hanamikoji street.

The set comes with 3 paper vases: one side depicts Mt. Fuji in varying colors so when flipped upside down it looks like Japan’s most well-known mountain. The other side is printed with fun graphics that represent Japan like Tokyo Tower, the bullet train and a daruma doll. And here’s a bit of spoon & tamago trivia: the design for our figurine characters that are part of our logo were originally inspired by the “chappie” dolls designed by Groovisions.

Admittedly, I had been warned: my train car waiting for me idly at Sendai Station wouldn’t open its doors unless I pressed a button. “It’s that cold where this train is headed,” I thought. I learned from a station attendant nearby that many parts of Yamagata Prefecture in northern Japan just had their first snowfall of the season last night. And less than 12 hours earlier I had learned that Donald Trump had won the election and would be the next president of the United States. So I decided to close my laptop and silence my twitter and facebook feed and go for a walk on a narrow road to the deep north. Specifically, I was emulating the poet Matsuo Basho who, in the 17th century, set off on a journey up north from Tokyo propelled by an effort to renew his own art. In 24 hours I had to make my way to Narita for a flight back to New York so I had just 1 day, rather than Basho’s 156. But the logistical efficiency of Japanese trains are amazing. And by 9 AM I was standing outside Yamadera station, feeling the the wintry of the north seep into my shoes. “Lend you a pair of boots?” A woman from a store nearby called out to me. I made my way over, carefully avoiding the slushiest of areas, and into a quasi-souvenir shop and restaurant. “Do you have my size? I’m a 30.” The woman looked down and laughed. “I can give you Dad’s but they still might be too small.” I tried on this kind woman’s father’s boots and indeed, they were tight. But it sure beat getting wet. Plus, I didn’t want to turn down the woman’s kind gesture, which was already making me feel toasty. “That’ll be 300 yen,” she smiled. Of course, I thought, slightly embarrassed, and handed over the coins. “Stop by for some warm potato soup on your way back,” she said, as I left. Basho referred to his poetry writing as “a wind-swept spirit” and likened it to “a thin drapery that is torn and swept away at the slightest stir of the wind.” His desire to roam he also likened to a form of wanderlust, and both firmly remained vested in some form of control that was not his own. Based on his journey, Basho eventually published a book of writing and poems called The Narrow Road to the Deep North . It’s only about 35 pages of text but it took Basho 5 years to write it. Which means that he likely obsessed over each and every word, tweaking and removing what was non-essential. At the beginning, after explaining why he set off on this walk, he opens with a poem: There are about 1000 steps to climb to Rishakuji Temple, perched on the top of the mountain. And depending on how long you stop to admire the stone steps, the straight trees or the many alters – both large and small – along the way, the climb can take anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour. The temperature had been steadily rising as the day grew older and, as I climbed, mounds of snow high in the trees above would come falling down in random places like small meteors falling to the ground. These snow stars would land unexpectedly, with a thud. And if you knew you weren’t in harms way you could watch the sparkly glitter of the star’s tail following behind as it fluttered to the ground. At one point, a small child – part of a school field trip – clasped his hands together and offered a prayer to a small stone deity: “please don’t let me get hit.” A fantastic view awaited those who climbed to the top. From a modest hut, one that monks used to meditate, you could look out across the mountainous land and immediately understand what what drew Basho to this part of Japan. Basho presumably wrote many of his poems while looking out at this same view – one that has largely remained the same for hundreds of years.”When a country is defeated,” Basho wrote, “there remain only mountains and rivers, and on a ruined castle in spring only grasses thrive. I sat down on my hat and wept bitterly till I almost forgot time.” He then penned what is one of his most profound poems: I made my way back into town feeling lighter and somewhat more energetic than earlier in the day, but not necessarily at peace either. Basho himself wrote about his own poetry saying that it constantly wavered between doubts. But he and I both took comfort in knowing that it’s the unquenchable love of what we do that prevents us from tipping one way or the other. And it’s for that reason that we hang on to our work somewhat blindly. Before I knew it I was standing back infront of the shop. “Okaerinasai.” The shop owner greeted me in an affectionate phrase that means welcome back. “I’ll get you a serving of that warm potato soup.” ","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["spoon tamago guide","Tohoku","wanderlust"],"date":"November 10, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"The Japanese Museum of Rocks That Look Like Faces","content":"In Chichibu, Japan, two hours northwest of Tokyo, there’s an odd museum; perhaps the only one of its kind.

An avid collector, the late Shozo Hayama spent 50 years collecting rocks that looked like faces. His only requirement was that nature be the only artist. There are currently so many rocks on display that some don’t even have names. So the owner occasionally invites visitors to name the rocks.

Koga’s new exhibition “Graphic” represented a stark deviation from his previous work, which typically was inspired by forms of nature: leaves, stones and driftwood. His new body of work is a series of delicate wire sculptures placed inside a frame. The wires are fused together just right so that the lines take the form of three-dimensional shapes. Koga, of course, is the first to recognize his new slant. “Just like there are beautiful forms in nature, equally beautiful forms exist in forms that only humans can create,” says Koga. The series is an attempt to isolate some of forms in day-to-day life that have become so obvious to us that we no longer notice them. But by recreating them in minimal wire and capturing them inside a frame where we can look but not touch, Koga manages to reposition our sense of beauty. Also on display are a series of wood sculptures called atelier, in which Koga has carved paint brushes out of a single block of wood. He’s then applied coats of paint to the sculpture so that the brushes appear to have just been placed there, rather than having emerged from the block of wood. “Graphic” is on display through November 26, 2016 at the gallery space “ PLACE ” ( Gmap ) in Shibuya.

The bank merged and became part of Bank of Yokohama in 1941, and was then shuttered the outpost in 1945. But its legacy lived on. The building miraculously survived the war, as well Japan’s penchant for scrapping and building. The building was later discovered by art director Kaoru Watanabe, who recalls his discovery saying that he always imagined the structure as a bar, rather than a bank. Watanabe went on to become a legendary force in the Japanese design and fashion world. He was art director for Japanese Ivy league-inspired clothing brand VAN Jacket , one of the most influential brands in the 1960s and 70s. In the early 80s he established his own agency and directed advertising for Kirin Brewery, IDEE PARCO and CBS Sony, just to name a few. In 2000, Watanabe teamed up with a young architect named Masamichi Katayama to renovate the old bank and turn it into a bar named “The Bank.” It was Katayama’s very first project as an independent architect after establishing his firm, Wonderwall . Katayama,, of course, went on to become a very successful architect. Watanabe ran his bar for 15 years until he fell ill and passed away in 2015. The bar was forced to close but Katayama, who had remained good friends with Watanabe, couldn’t let the project become just a memory. “Till the very end he never wanted to close his bar,” says Katayama , who decided to not only give it a renovation but to renew the lease and take over management too. In November of 2016 The Bank reopened. Old-timers will rejoice when they find that the renovation is really more of a dusting. Most of the original furniture and finishings are the same and have merely been refurbished. The 2nd floor, which was originally used for storage, is now a lounge.

Literally meaning ‘silver mountain,’ the location became famous for its old-Japan look and feel after it was used for the site of the period drama Oshin. Ginzan was originally founded in 1456 as a silver mine, hence the name Silver Mountain. But it wasn’t until 1741 that hot springs were discovered – an unexpected consequences of mining for silver – and the village experienced a renaissance. Ginzan is tucked away in the mountains of Yamagata, Japan. But it’s more of a hamlet than a village. You can walk from one end to the other in 5 minutes. But that’s part of what makes this quaint little nook so fascinating. On a recent trip up north, we visited Ginzan Onsen after a hike in Yamadera . If you’re headed in this direction we recommended combining the two, as they’re only about an hour apart. And after walking up and down 1200 steps, a soak in one of Ginzan’s hot springs is exactly what your body will want. There is a public , or foot bath, for those who don’t feel like completely immersing themselves in water. There are also 2 other public baths for day-trippers and if you’re staying at one of the inns, which look like something right out of the movie Spirited Away, you’ll of course have access to their hot spring as well. But a calming river that flows through this picturesque village of hot springs isn’t the only thing Ginzan Onsen has going for it. There are quaint little eateries, a bar and souvenir shops that carry local wooden crafts. And if you’re up for a little more walking you can even follow the river upstream and explore waterfalls and some of the caves that were old silver mines. There are 12 different inns to choose from and rates range depending on season but are generally in the range of 17,000 yen per person / night. Each inn is unique in structure and despite their old-world Japan charm, they were originally built in a western style, which was characterized by 3-4 storied multilevel structures. But over time they were slowly renovated and took on a more Japanese look and feel. There are some fascinating historic photos over on the official website . The tricky part is getting to and from Ginzan Onsen from the train station. The village is quite isolated and accessible only motor vehicle. If you’re staying at one of the inns, they provide shuttles. But if you’re day tripping you’ll have to plan to take the bus, which only runs every 2 hours. We happened to miss the bus both ways and took a taxi (6000 yen one-way trip… ouch). Ginzan Onsen is beautiful anytime of year, and each season presents a different set of colors. The most popular time is Spring but winter is pretty amazing too . But no matter when you go, plan to stay in the village until the evening because that’s when all the lanterns light up. It really is quite a sight.","post_categories":["Go and See"],"post_tags":["spoon tamago guide","Tohoku","wanderlust"],"date":"November 18, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Interior Designer Shigeru Uchida: 1943 – 2016","content":"We were saddened to learn that Japanese interior designer Shigeru Uchida passed away earlier this week on November 21, 2016 from pancreatic cancer.

The much-anticipated Sumida Hokusai Museum , dedicated to world-renowned ukiyo-e artist Katsushika Hokusai, opened this week. And it looks beautiful. The museum was designed by Kazuyo Sejima, perhaps Japan’s most well-known female architect, who is known for her ethereal forms and high level of refinement that unnervingly capture a site’s social and physical context. Sejima created an angular structure that encompasses and reflects on Hokusai’s own interest in oblique angles and contrasts of near and far; manmade and natural. The 4-storied structure will have permanent but also rotating special exhibitions that display the massive 1800+ collection of Hokusai’s work that’s part of the collection. And the museum’s location is no coincidence. Hokusai spent the majority of his career working and creating artwork in the Sumida Ward of Tokyo. There’s even a map on the museum’s website that lets you explore certain locations of interest. In conjunction with the opening of the museum, residents of Sumida Ward are getting something special: the chance to obtain a custom Hokusai license plate! If you live in Sumida Ward you can apply here . The logo for the museum is also interesting. It was chosen based on an open call for entries back in 2009. The winner, Kiyoji Takase, came up with the unique idea to borrow the lightning bolt that appear’s in one of Hokusai’s more famous works. The logo “has a sharp and strong form,” says the museum, and “makes us feel its intensity and energy.” The spreading of lightning bolts also represents the philosophy of this museum – “disseminating information to the world.” ","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["Kazuyo Sejima","tokyo guide","tokyo guide art shows","ukiyo-e"],"date":"November 24, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"8 Ukiyo-e That Show How Fun Snow Was in Edo Period Japan","content":"Yesterday, Tokyo woke up to their first November snow in over 50 years.

There she encountered a rhino that had been rescued from poachers who prey on the beautiful animal only for its tusk, which to this day, are bought and sold for high prices. “I still remember the kindness in that Rhino’s eyes,” she says , speaking about the encounter, which inspired her to begin making animal-themed artwork. Today, Hitotsuyama and her partner Tomiji Tamai create animals, built to real-life scale, entirely out of used newspaper . Each piece is painstakingly assembled by rolling wet newspaper into small bits and pieces, which help contribute to the realistic appearance. The artist then uses tweezers to attach the rolled up newspaper to the body, which is also fashioned out of newspaper. “More than anything else, I’m particular about the realistic feel of the animals,” says the artist , speaking about her work. “They are living ordinary everyday lives just like us. I would like keep insisting on reality and producing my life-sized work as much as possible in order to convey their lives.” Hitotsuyama Studio is based in Shizuoka, inside an old warehouse where Hitotsuyama’s family used to operate a paper strip manufacturing plant.

When we first moved there in the early 80s hardly anyone had heard of Halloween. My Dad though, being the prankster that he is, found pleasure in dressing up in a white cloak with a Tengu mask and walking around our neighborhood. And at 6 ft 4 I’m surprised no one ever called the police on him.  We would also host small Halloween parties for the local kids, teaching them about jack-o-lanterns and the joys of trick-or-treating. These small gestures, combined over the years, may very well have helped contribute to the spread of Halloween consciousness in our small community. But costumes and disguises have long been a part of Japanese culture, which makes it surprising that Halloween is just now gaining mass-participation. In fact, ukiyo-e woodblock prints from the 1800s reveals that costumes were a very real part of many Japanese traditions. One example is this can be found in a piece by prominent ukiyo-e artist  Hiroshige Utagawa depicting a summer moon festival. Painted between 1841 and 1842, the scene captures a vibrant procession of people. One individual in particular seems to be having way more fun than anyone else. Why? Because he’s dressed like an octopus. There was another popular event during the Edo period called , in which people would dress up as famous actors or historical figures and parade through town. Spectators would often yell “shomou,” meaning “more,” which would prompt an extended impersonation of the character.

Last year the winner was a personal mobility chair and the year before that it was a robotic arm. This year, the grand prize went to a world map . But the map of the world has been around for hundreds of years. So what’s so special about this map? To begin, Tokyo-based architect and artist Hajime Narukawa has a problem with our current map and he’s been working for years to try and fix it. In 1569 geographer Gerardus Mercator revealed his world map and, to this day, it’s the generally accepted image we have of this planet. But it has major flaws in that it dramatically distorts the sizes of Antarctica and Greenland. Narukawa developed a map projection method called AuthaGraph (and founded a company of the same name in 2009) which aims to create maps that represent all land masses and seas as accurately as possible. Narukawa points out that in the past, his map probably wasn’t as relevant. A large bulk of the 20th century was dominated by an emphasis on East and West relations. But with issues like climate change, melting glaciers in Greenland and territorial sea claims, it’s time we establish a new view of the world: one that equally perceives all interests of our planet. AuthaGraph not only faithfully represents all oceans and continents, but the map can be tessellated just like an MC Escher painting. Much in the same way that we can traverse the planet without ever coming to an end, “the AuthaGraphic world map provides an advanced precise perspective of our planet.” Go here to find out where you can purchase posters and globes based on the AuthaGraph project.

For this location, the coffee shop coincidentally chose a spot that Nagasaka was quite familiar with. “It was such a great honor for me to design the renovation of my favorite building that I used to see every day,” said Nagasaka, who explained that for the last 9 years he had admired the building out of his shared office across the street. “It was a three-story steel structure formerly used as an electric factory” which the architects converted into a café but also an office and a training space for baristas. “In order to continue the sense of small scale into the space, floors are divided in a stepped-floor style, while utilizing the existing openings formerly used for loading/unloading and storing.” Blue Bottle Coffee Nakameguro opened on October 28, 2016 and is located along Komazawa-dori ( Map ) and is a 10-min walk from Nakameguro Station. A 6th location, on the 3rd floor of the Atre Shinagawa retail complex, is expected this fall.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["Blue Bottle","Schemata Architecture","tokyo guide","tokyo guide new"],"date":"November 4, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Bake: A Renovated Kyoto Townhouse Turned into a Cheese Tart Shop","content":"Bake isn’t any ordinary pastry shop. Although its roots date back 33 years to a small pastry business in Hokkaido, today it functions more like a tech startup. It has an R&D lab , as well as a web magazine . And with creative side-projects like Pictcake (upload smartphone photo and print it on a cake) and 99chocolate (customize your own chocolate bars) the company is defying many stereotypes associated with Japanese companies. So it’s no surprise that their latest shop in Kyoto blends traditional architecture and woodwork with Lego. Despite its many spokes, Bake’s signature brand and item is their cheese tart, which is sold at a shop called “ Bake Cheese Tart .” So when they were looking to expand into Kyoto they hired architect Yusuke Seki to help craft their image in a Kyoto shopping district. “The layers of Japanese history remain deepest and most wholly intact here,” says Seki , who helped renovate an old kominca townhouse. But at the same time, a dramatic influx of tourists has “modulated” tradition. So the architect decided to take a more experimental approach with the shop. A re-conceptualization of what it means to be “local” led to the selection of diverse building materials. “Cheese tarts, freshly baked in the open kitchen at the back of the store, are soon lined up and displayed on a counter constructed of Lego.” The thinking, according to Seki, is that the universal appeal of Lego will create a shared language between those of different cultures. But to maintain authenticity and pay homage to its locality, the shop employs shitaji-mado, a lattice framework technique traditionally used in the construction of Japanese teahouses. The shop opened for business this summer in Kyoto and is a 5 min walk from Kawaramachi Station ( Map ).

Every 7 years a 200-year old fir tree, one that stands straight as if reaching up to the heavens, becomes the centerpiece for one of Japan’s oldest, grandest and most dangerous festivals: the Onbashira Festival. “What a grand tree,” says an elderly woman who has come to pay her respects to the tree. “Humans can only hope to be this grand.” Measuring 20 meters (65 ft) and clocking in at 10 tons, the fir tree is transported to the top of a hill. Eight days later, hundreds of men will attempt to ride the tree, and the deity that lives inside it, as it crashes down the steep hill towards the bottom. The festival reaches its finale when the tree is then lifted into the air – assuming its original position – and men attempt to climb to the top. In May of this year, 1 man died. During the previous festival 2 men died. In fact, injury – and sometimes death – is a common element in this festival, which only takes place in the town of Suwa in Nagano prefecture. To understand how this unique festival originated, and why it continues to flourish only in this one local region of Japan, we must begin the story 10,000 years ago to the Jomon period when Japan was inhabited by hunter-gatherers. They ate nuts and berries, and also boar meat, which they would dry and preserve. In the winter, they would keep warm by wearing the hides of the animals they had eaten. And so, every part of their lives were closely tied to the forest. And the forest gave them everything they needed. It’s not surprising that they naturally came to believe that the forest was inhabited by deities. But a significant change in lifestyle occurred around 500 – 600 BC when rice paddy culture entered Japan, eventually ushering in what we now refer to as the Yayoi Period. It meant a new, self-sufficient lifestyle. And early adopters were rewarded with power and a comfortable lifestyle that resulted from being able to sell rice for other goods. However, when you look at how rice paddy culture spread throughout Japan, a fascinating insight is revealed. It began in the south and spread quickly north. But as it approaches the Chubu region, adoption of the new way of life comes to a halt. Rice farming culture then bypasses this region, begins in the North and works its way down. This final holdout is where Suwa is located, and represents a resistance to a new way of life. It’s the location where Jomon culture refused to part with the forest that had supported its livelihood for generations. The tale also exists in parallel in the Kojiki, Japan’s oldest chronicle of historical records and myths. As legend has it, the deity Takeminakata, after losing a test of strength, fled to Suwa. But when he arrived, he found that the mountain deity Moreya was already occupying the land. A skilled hunter and in touch with mother earth, Moreya was indeed an image of the Jomon people. Moreya attempted to prevent Takeminakata from entering Suwa but after a long battle Moreya was defeated. But instead of banishing Moreya, Takeminakata asked Moreya to remain and help him rule. And so the Onbashira festival remains as a testament to a time when ancestors lived among the forest and trees. It’s a testament to a time when the transfer of power and culture threatened to shake the very way of life of a group of people. And it’s a testament to resistance: a fight against change and a futile effort to push against the changing tide of time. This article was based largely on an NHK documentary on the subject, which is available above in full.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["history"],"date":"October 17, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Yuki no Okura: A Wintry Snowscape Painted Entirely in Microsoft Excel","content":"Okura is a village nestled deep in the mountains of Nagano Prefecture.

We spent a week in Hokkaido, eating, seeing and chasing around some of our favorite artists, designers and architects. Hokkaido is lush, green, beautiful and large. We barely scratched the surface but we thought we would share some of our favorite spots. Most adventures will begin in Sapporo, the capital of Hokkaido and the closest city to Chitose Airport where we arrived. In the city center you’ll find Oodori Park . If you have kids, like we do, you’ll want to spend a few hours walking up and down the long horizontal park just taking in the beautiful surroundings. I have a particular weakness for cityscapes with mountain views in the background. Around the center you’ll find two playable sculptures by Noguchi Isamu. As we’ve often found, simple forms afford freedom and creativity, and kids can spend hours playing on this small section of the park. While you’re walking along Oodori Park, be sure to stop by Kitakaro , a Japanese sweets shop designed by architect Tadao Ando. The beautiful structure is actually a renovated library originally built in 1926. It houses a large section of souvenirs on the first floor and a cafe on the 2nd floor, which is also where you’ll find this gorgeous bookshelf that pays homage to the structure’s heritage. There’s even a small museum of historical photos and documents next to the café. Around late afternoon, head to Mt. Moiwa . It’s about a 20 min drive from Sapporo and there are also free shuttles. A cable car will take you up to the top and as soon as you get there, grab tickets for the planetarium show (although it’s only in Japanese, it’s still worth it). While you’re waiting for the show to begin, check out the stunning views of Sapporo from above. You definitely want to be there for sunset, but then also hang around until it’s dark; between the sparkling lights of the city and the sparkling lights in the sky you won’t know where to look. Plan to spend an entire day at Moerenuma Park . In 1988, artist Isamu Noguchi visited the site that, which was then a landfill. He’s known to have looked out across the vast trashpile and said, “we’ve harmed this land and it’s my job to revive it with art.”  And revive it he did. Over the next 6 months Noguchi designed pathways, playgrounds and fountains over a vast 190 acres of land. He passed away just 1 month after finishing the plans, making Moerenuma his last major masterpiece. The park didn’t open for another 17 years in 2005 but his spirit lives on in every element. You can rent bicycles for a small fee and easily spend an entire day exploring all the different pockets this sculpture has to offer. Normally we wouldn’t include a cemetery in our guide, but the Makomanai Takinoreien recently welcomed a new addition to their beautiful grounds. Hill of Buddha opened just this summer, making it one of architect Tadao Ando’s latest pieces. And it’s one of the most peaceful and calming places we’ve ever been. In fact, we ended up going twice. Completed in Ando’s signature cement, a pool of water and a pathway leads up to a circular structure accessible by tunnel. 15,000 lavender plants are planted in a circular fashion along the roof of the structure.  As you approach, the head of a large Buddha statue becomes visible, but then disappears again, only to reveal itself once you’ve travelled through the tunnel. It really is a stunning location that can be visited any time of the year.  About 2 hours West of Sapporo by car is Lake Toya and Mt. Usu , a fun excursion and a chance to climb an active volcano, which is always fun and exciting. A cable car gets you about halfway up and from there you can hike as little or as much as you want, depending on your fitness level. At the foot of the mountain there are some fun souvenir shops but definitely stop by the food stands from some amazing grilled corn and fresh melon. So good! Oh, if you’re looking for accommodations along the way, we would suggest either the Midori no Kaze Resort (amazing hot baths) or the Nono Kaze Resort (amazing food and views of the lake). In central Hokkaido is Biei , one of the most beautiful places we’ve ever seen. Rolling hills as far as the eye can see and views of the sky and clouds are so vast it will leave you breathless. Oddly enough, there’s a really famous tree called the “Seven Stars Tree” because it was used in a commercial for Seven Stars cigarettes. Other recommendations in Biei: definitely stop by Biei farm and have some of their delicious milk and ice cream (pro-tip: the milk bottles are super cute and make great souvenirs). Although it’s swarming with tourists non-stop, since you’re nearby you might as well go see the famous blue lake . As long as you keep your expectations low you won’t be too disappointed. In Biei we stayed at an adorable hotel called Bi-Ble . We inquired about the naming and it has nothing to do with the bible. Bi is for Biei and Ble is wheat flour in French. Not only do the rooms have amazing views of Biei’s rolling hills, a huge perk of staying in a hotel that’s also a bakery is that you get freshly baked bread for breakfast. But that’s not to discount the dinner. Consisting of fresh meats and vegetables all locally sourced, it was probably the best meal we had our entire trip. Even if you don’t stay the night we still recommend dining here. If you’re an S&T reader you may have come across North Farm Stock in the past. They make condiments like pickles, jams and sauces all using local ingredients and adorably packaged by local design studio Terashima Design . We’re big fans. And even though their products are stocked in shops around Tokyo, we couldn’t resist the chance to visit the mothership. It was just as beautiful as we imagined. Just days before we visited, the store had completed an expansion to include a beautiful wooden deck where you can sit outside. They also have a café on the 2 floor, but don’t feel guilty about skipping it. It actually wasn’t anything special. After encountering Kan Yasuda’s sculptures in Naoshima a year earlier we were determined to reconnect with the artist and his work here in Hokkaido where he’s originally from. It was raining but the Kan Yasuda Sculpture Garden is one of those places that is beautiful rain or shine; summer or winter. Bibai is an old mining town that almost disappeared in the 70s when the coal mines closed down. A local school and its grounds shut down because there weren’t any children. That same school, and its grounds, has now been beautifully renovated and houses numerous sculptures by Yasuda, who wanted to create a garden where children could come back to play.

Siebold was also a botanist and art enthusiast and part of his collection eventually ended up in the National Museum of Ethnology in the Netherlands. However, the artist behind six paintings, created in Western styles, remained unknown. Until a group of researchers took a closer look at records kept by Siebold’s descendants. The six paintings were created in water color, and in western styles, leading curators to believe they were done by an unknown western artist. However, a group of researchers, led by a prominent expert on Hokusai, examined the paintings recently and decided to investigate further. By cross-referencing records obtained from Siebold’s descendants, the researchers discovered documents that indicated “Hokusai created paintings in our style,” according to NHK . This led them to believe that there is a high likelihood that the paintings are the work of Katsushika Hokusai. The researchers revealed their findings at a conference in Japan on October 22. Five of the six paintings were done on washi paper and depict the landscapes of Edo (current Tokyo) like Nihonbashi and Shinagawa.

Several years ago a young Japanese man working in automobile marketing discovered one such book. “I was fascinated by the traditional techniques of creating strong bonds without the use of nails or adhesive,” he says, speaking with Spoon & Tamago.

But with the help of a decades-old pencil factory in Tokyo, this sakura-shaped pencil has finally blossomed. The original idea for the sakura pencil came from graphic designer Hiroaki Doi in 2015, who entered a design contest sponsored by stationary company Sun-Star. Doi’s design won . But it was an arduous journey actually bringing the concept to market. Apparently, it’s really hard to make pencils in any other non-conventional shape. But now, the concept has finally blossomed. The sakura pencil will go on sale in mid-October. At 394 yen (roughly $4) per pencil, it’s definitely not cheap. But they come individually packaged and make beautiful presents, perhaps for those just starting school. One of the best parts is that the pencil shavings have been designed to look like cherry blossom petals . In fact, Doi’s original concept for the pencil was inspired by its ephemeral nature. In a sense, a pencil whittled down by use is symbolic of a child’s growth. Doi drew on the similarities and connections between pencils and the fleeting cherry blossom to come up with his concept.

And so was the sake that was made from this rice. In order to maximize profits, breweries would water down their sake before they delivered them to sake shops. And, in turn, sake shops would also water down their stock before selling it to consumers. The fraudulent practice became so commonplace that eventually a term was coined to refer to such sake: (goldfish sake), meaning that the sake was so watered down that goldfish could swim in it. But the 250-year old sake brewery Imayo Tsukasa never participated in such practice. In fact, as legend has it, they maintained excellent relationships with the sake shops who appreciated their pure sake. The sake brewery family decided to create a brand of sake inspired by this important part of sake-making history. But instead of goldfish, they took their name from the distant cousin of carp: koi.

And this type of toilet devotion extends to public toilets too. In fact, the Japanese government even awards a highly coveted Toilet of the Year Award to spaces deemed worthy. After all, the government estimates that in our lifetime we spend up to 11 months in a bathroom. So why shouldn’t they be spaces that are clean, soothing and relaxing? So, officials created a pamphlet (PDF) of public toilets they deemed exemplary, and distributed it earlier this year in hopes of elevating the entire public toilet industry. Here are a selection of government-approved public toilets. In the “ShinQs” shopping section of the department store is an oasis of a bathroom. Five women were put on the project team to design their ideal bathroom, which they called “Switch Room” because it serves as a space where you can turn yourself off and back on. A space with plenty of greenery and a separate entrance and exit so those going in never bump into those coming out. The toilets are also strategically placed to make it easy to identify which stalls are not occupied. This shopping mall has always taken a progressive stance to designing their toilets and often reach out to their female employees for feedback. Colaborating with art students from a local university, this bathroom incorporates a rotating art gallery of student work. A bathroom with an emphasis on friendly materials, colors and lighting that incorporates playful touches here and there. At Narita Airport, Japan’s gateway to the world, an art installation-like lineup of toilets greet travelers. Here you’ll find iconic toilet-maker Toto’s latest toilet technology, which is of course available for public usage. We wrote about this project here . At Haneda you’ll find a public bathroom that’s been specifically designed to aid and assist disabled travelers. Universal signage, wide passageways and even a toilet for service dogs makes this bathroom user-friendly for absolutely anyone. Modeled after a gazebo, this public restroom inside Shin-Osaka train station has wide passageways for wheel chairs and a layout that creates a more efficient flow (pun intended) of people. Various design choices were made to this underground public restroom at Nihonbashi Station to contrast the cave-like feel often associated with underground spaces. Highway service areas usually have the grossest toilets. But not at Neopasa, where an oasis of clean and beautiful toilets await tired drivers and passengers. There are more than twice as many stalls in the ladies’ room, compared to the men’s, to combat longer lines. And a large monitor screen at the entrance even tells you which stalls are unoccupied. This is the only service area along the Tomei Expressway that has views of the sea. So the operator decided to build their bathroom on the 2nd floor near the terrace and create a space where people want to go, not just because they have to go.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["toilets"],"date":"October 13, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Send a letter, and an entire galaxy, with Starry Sky Envelopes","content":"Technology is increasingly replacing the need for hand-written letters.

Beautiful but old homes begin to crumble without proper maintenance, creating a vicious cycle of abandonment. One such municipality was the town of Kamiyama (Tokushima Prefecture) with a population of just under 6000. In 1995 the town’s main shopping street was bustling with activity with close to 40 shops. But by 2008 that number had dropped to the single digits. But Kamiyama had something that bigger cities didn’t: lush greenery and a laid back atmosphere where time tends to move a lot slower. And they also had something that big cities did: a robust telecom infrastructure with high-speed internet throughout the town. And people began noticing this. But the big change occurred when two architects who had been studying overseas returned to Japan. Kosuke Bando was originally from Tokushima and had been studying architecture at Harvard University. Issei Suma had completed stints at the Rockwell Group and Voorsanger Architects after completing a master’s program at Columbia. Bando’s first project in Kamiyama happened in 2010 when he completed “Blue Bear Office.” The renovated (traditional tenement house), originally built 80 years ago, served as sort of a pilot program to see if architecture and “creative depopulation” could lead to sustainable community building. The building was used on and off as a temporary workstation or gallery. But two years later another big change occurred. Earlier in his life, Suma had attended college in Tokyo and one of his classmates was Chika Terada, who had gone on to found the business card management company Sansan . Suma told Terada about the town and it’s possibilities. Terada signed on. And in 2012 the company relocated some its staff to Sansan Kamiyama Lab . And once that happened, other companies followed. Kamiyama has since earned itself the nickname “Green Valley.” As of last year, 12 companies had established satellite offices in the town and over 30 new jobs have been created. A bakery, a café, a shoe shop and even a dentist’s office have opened along the old shopping street. Researchers project that by 2035, Kamiyama’s population will be cut in half. But at this rate, they may have to revise their estimates.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["renovation","shotengai"],"date":"September 21, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Japanese Fairy Tale Characters Fight Off an Evil Mickey Mouse in 1934 Propaganda Anime","content":"Mickey Mouse is one of the most popular cartoon characters in Japan, in line with beloved domestics like Totoro, Doraemon and Hello Kitty.

After her 1st and 2nd albums (released in 1999 and 2003, respectively) broke all kinds of records in Japan, the artist unexpectedly announced an indefinite leave from music in 2010 to focus on herself. Since then, it’s been a bit of a roller coaster ride for her with her mother’s tragic death in 2013, her marriage in 2014 and then the birth of her son the following year. And now she’s back with a full-length album and we couldn’t be happier for her. One of the more anticipated tracks (at least for us) is , a collaboration between longtime friend and muse Ringo Shiina. In the space travel-inspired music video (embedded above), the two vocalists hold hands, exchange longing glances and embrace as they sing about a 2-hour escape from reality in a show of support for the LGBT community. It’s surprising how well Shiina’s sultry voice works together with Utada’s more traditional pop style. The collaboration is also noteworthy because Shiina was put in charge of directing Japan’s portion of the closing ceremony at the Rio Olympics, and one could speculate that she’s also going to be involved in the performance segments of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. This puts Utada, a bilingual speaker of English and Japanese, and a position to participate in some capacity as well. We would also note that another track from the new album “ ” is the theme song for NHK’s current serialized TV program ( ).

To this day, even contemporary homes in Japan that are either carpeted or have wooden floors, will have a (Japanese room) that consists entirely of tatami mats. Tatami date back all the way to the Nara Period of the 700s and have always been reserved for flooring. But now, a Japanese company is trying to broaden the possibilities of tatami by creating a line of furniture upholstered in tatami. Major architectural planning and materials company Daiken teamed up with French interior designer Jose Levy to create “ Moving Tatamis .” The line of furniture, which includes a bench, mini table as well as storage units, incorporates the company’s proprietary “ ,” a form of machine-produced tatami that utilizes washi paper instead of the traditional straw. Tatami furniture may seem radical in Japan, which is perhaps why the company decided to release it first in Europe at the prestigious Maison & Objet show in Paris. And Jose Levy turned out to be a perfect fit for reimagining the traditional Japanese elements. Anatole, the designer’s grandfather, founded a company in Japan called and in the 1960s specialized in making martial arts equipment. “An inveterate traveler with an abiding passion for Japan, Anatole took back to France special machines that would enable him to locally produce authentic tatamis, kimonos and bokken.” In 2012, Jose even spent several months in Japan for a residency program, which resulted in an exhibition of sculptures (one made using tatami) and photographs.

And it’s not uncommon for companies to incorporate seasonal themes into advertising. Japanese beer companies, in particular, are known for their proactive development of limited-time seasonal beers. But this super-creative ad by Kirin definitely caught our eye. The Grand Kirin is a craft beer brewed in the style of a Calypso IPA. (Calypso happens to be the name of one of Saturn’s moons) And this Fall, Kirin is releasing a special beer, which celebrates the autumn harvest moon. Specifically, refers to the moon on the 16 night of the month – the day after the harvest full moon, which was yesterday – and is meant to inspire a longingness for the moon, which has begun to wane and rise later in the evening. The ad itself is beautiful in its own right – an illustrated half-moon with similarly illustrated bottles that appear to be watching it rise. But when placed in train cars as they are intended, the glossy ceiling creates a reflection that renders the half-moon as full. As it so happens, today is the 16 day of the month so, this evening, look up into the sky, crack open a beer if that’s your thing, and wait for the moon to rise. As the ad points out, “there’s beauty in a waning moon.”","post_categories":["Graphic Design"],"post_tags":["advertising","beer"],"date":"September 16, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Kengo Kuma’s $80K Silver Tea Set for Georg Jensen","content":"Ever since David Chu took the reins of Danish silverware and jewelry heritage brand Georg Jensen in 2013, he’s tried to re-position the company away from a lifestyle brand and more towards art and design. Part of his strategy in doing this was to actively collaborate with artists and architects. And Chu did not waste any time as the company has since worked with industrial designer Marc Newson, Spanish designer Patricia Urquila as well as the late architect Zaha Hadid. Now in its 111th year, George Jensen has, for the first time, collaborated with an Asian designer: the famed Japanese architect Kengo Kuma . Kuma has designed a lavish Japanese tea set called Kusa – grass, in Japanese – made from silver. Intended to be used for the tea ceremony, the set consists of a (tea cady), (whisk), (tea scoop) and (tea bowl), as well as a tray. The and are made with a reflective mirror finish on the inside and a contrasting oxidized surface on the outside. In addition, the outside surface of the pieces are decorated with latticework of silver that brings to mind grass waving in the wind. Only 11 editions were made and are being sold only through select outposts at an extravagantly priced $80k USD. While the sets are certainly pretty, we can’t help but note that the exclusive price tag contradicts everything the tea ceremony is supposed to be about: modesty and rustic simplicity.

The structure and its interior was designed by architect Toyo Ito and is characterized by an undulating latticed wooden ceiling. Numerous curved globes act and look like giant lamp shades as they filter natural sunlight into the space while also defining the circular “knowledge hubs” they encapsulate. The space is a visual depiction of the facility’s concept: “From roots to branches, may our knowledge grow and blossom as we plant new seeds for the future.” However, Gifu Media Cosmos is much more than just a library. And a signage campaign by Kenya Hara helps make the vast multipurpose facility, which includes a gallery space and community exchange activity center on the ground level, easily identifiable and accessible. “Graphic patterns were applied to the giant umbrellas made of triaxial woven fabric,” says Hara, referring to the hanging domes. This forms “the starting point for spatial recognition.” “We worked to integrate the signage with the building space, including the 3D map providing an overview of the entire space, directional signs inlaid into the linoleum, and signs that can be viewed from any direction.” – Kenya Hara (thanks to Rumi for the tip!)","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["Kenya Hara","Toyo Ito"],"date":"August 16, 2016"},{"author":"Kaori Freda","title":"Take 10 minutes for yourself with hibi incense","content":"All over Japan, incense is used for its meditative and purifying qualities, as well as for its important role in spiritual and ancestral rituals, such as lighting incense before greeting ancestors at the family shrine.

After locals discovered its fragrant properties, news quickly spread to governmental officials, and soon burning incense was all the rage amongst Japanese court royalty. Today, Awaji Island produces more than 70% of Japan’s incense! Since its fabled inception on Awaji Island, various corporations have passed on the torch and have worked together to innovate on an age-old tradition.

Also known as table tennis, ping-pong is a popular competitive sport requiring players to have extraordinary hand-eye coordination and instantaneous reflexes. Have you glimpsed those lovely new ping-pong tables in the Rio 2016 Olympics? San-EI Corporation, a leading Japanese manufacturer of ping-pong tables, had the honour of supplying the tables this year. These tables sport curvaceous wooden legs in lieu of the regular spindly ones, and boasts a new table colour called “Les yeux bleus”, or blue eyes.  In an interview, SAN-EI Corp. President Shin Miura explained how he was inspired by the experience of Japanese immigrants to Brazil, in which table tennis was a frequent source of entertainment in immigrants’ daily lives, to supply tables for the Rio Games. Together with Shinichi Sumikawa (who designed Sony’s Walkman), Miura sought ways to combine Japanese and Brazilian elements into one cohesive whole, while paying respect to the great 2011 Japanese earthquake disaster. In hearing that Japan took home 3 medals (1 silver and 2 bronze) in this year’s tournament, Sumikawa said he felt “elated” and “thankful” that he was given the opportunity to design the  tables. And although he typically doesn’t reveal design sketches, he did share this image below in light of all the media attention that the tables are getting: According to San-Ei engineer Yesao Yoshizawa, when the International Table Tennis Federation first saw Sumikawa’s design sketches for the uniquely shaped legs, they said , “This table’s construction is absolutely unstable.

These transistorized tape players presented themselves as objects of empowerment, tempting their owners with dazzling chrome volume dials that could be ramped up to fill an entire street block with deafening noise with a simple flick of the fingers. Boombox owners would punk-up their stereos by plastering them with stickers of their favourite bands or musical style. On the street, the biggest and most flashy boombox won the most attention from passersby, despite the difficulty of carrying it.

While most of the text is written in Japanese, there is a handy list in the back detailing the production years of each boombox. Scroll down to see more and click here for a whole thread of ’em! In a Japan Times article , avid boombox collector Junichi Matsuzaki explains the boombox’s rise in popularity in the 1980’s and that, although Japan started out by copying products made in the West, boomboxes produced in Japan gradually became more and more creative.  Matsuzaki is particularly attached to vintage boomboxes because they use such high-quality parts, producing seamless sound. He explains, saying “The iPhone, for example, only lets you scroll the volume bar on its touch-screen. Vintage radio/cassette players, on the other hand, are equipped with a sound meter… and a cassette counter, which marks the passing of time.” If you are itching to get your own adorable Japanese boombox or its hulking American equivalent, do keep in mind that replacing broken parts in somewhat impossible- you’ll have to either 3-D print your own part or, as a last resort, reach out to Matsuzaki!

Work to repair stone walls and other damaged properties is expected to take several years given the buildings historic significance: it was originally built in the 1400s but reconstructed in 1960. In early June reconstruction efforts began with one of the most time-sensitive projects: restoring the Iidamaru Gokai Yagura, a five-story guard tower that was at risk of imminent collapse. Seismic shocks caused much of the stone wall supporting the Iidamaru Gokai Yagura guard tower to collapse. As a result, only about 8 stones remained standing , supporting a corner of the 5-ton tower and preventing it from collapsing. It was truly a miracle that the tower remained standing, which earned the stones the name “miracle single stoned wall,” and were likened to the “ miracle pine ” that remained standing after the 2011 tsunami.  Yesterday, photos were unveiled on the Kumamoto Castle Facebook page showing the massive efforts to create a gigantic movable steel arm that would reach under the tower to keep it from falling. The arm successfully slid under the tower so that workers can now begin restoring the collapsed wall. But believe it or not, this was the easy part. Rebuilding the stone walls will be like putting together a huge jigsaw puzzle. Based on photographs and historic documents, each stone – large and small – will be assigned a number. They will then be stacked exactly the way they were in order to ensure accuracy. “Even one mistake will make it impossible to restore the walls,” said Daisaku Hayashi, the president of the local construction company in charge of restoration.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["castles","earthquake resistance"],"date":"July 26, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"What Would Cities Look Like if They Were “Tokyo-ized”","content":"Eiji, the protagonist in David Mitchell’s novel number9dream described Tokyo as “too close up to see.” His experience of the metropolis goes on: “There are no distances and everything is above your head – dentists, kindergartens, dance studios.

This clear material, which allows for unobstructed views throughout the entire office, is made by the same manufacture that produces the wind-resistant cockpits on shinkansen (bullet trains). And Maezawa’s taste for art and design can be seen throughout the space with its eclectic selection of seating – there are apparently over 60 different types of chairs and sofas from Herman Miller to Vitra.

Sato collected twigs of different sizes to create a collection of 2 to 15 mm point “park pens.” He then came up with an adorable logo and packaging, and lined them up to make them look like a selection in a stationery shop.

Couples of birds and frogs sit on the branches while deer and elephants poke their head around the foot of the tree. The tortoise itself grows from a bowl, which sits in the middle of a miniature city. The entire piece, rests on a cabinet, just like any indoor bonsai plant might. The idyllic, almost Noah’s arc-like settings, are part of a new series of acrylic paintings by Japanese artist Takumi Kama . Kama’s new series of paintings include “Giant Tortoise Bonsai,” “Toad Bonsai” and “Small Turtle Kokedama,” as well as the Zen rock garden-inspired “Moon.” Bonsai are carefully manipulated plants that are significant in their simplicity, harmony and age. Kama’s paintings seem to represent nature’s harmonious coexistence with other elements. And yet the paintings remain surreal and mysterious. The abundance of animals is both natural and unatural at the same time, and seem to negate the presence of the human hand.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["animals","bonsai"],"date":"July 17, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Music Monday: Sakanaction","content":"Sakanaction is a Japanese rock band formed in 2005 around and fronted by Ichiro Yamaguchi. He’s joined by the rather rare combination of 2 females and 2 males. The band’s name is a portmanteau of the words sakana, meaning fish – chosen also for the words rarity in band names – and action. A majority of the band members hail from Hokkaido, where they originally met in high school. Sakanaction merges elements of traditional rock with new wave and electronica. Yamaguchi, with his thin-rimmed circular glasses, counts, among others, Japanese folk singers of the 60s and 70s like Wataru Takada and Masato Tomobe, who sang about political and social issues. Later down the road he got more into the electronic sounds of Kraftwerk, Jeff Mills and Tortoise. Action came for Sakanaction in 2010 when their single Arukuaround shot to 3rd on the charts in Japan, exposing them to a whole new fan base. And since then their music has gone on to be fairly successful, which is difficult in a land where charts are dominated by the bubble gum sounds and synchronized dancing of girl and boy bands. “Sure, there’s a lot of crap music here, but there’s a lot of good stuff, too,” he said in a 2010 interview . “Intelligent music is in the minority now, but I believe it will become mainstream in the future.” Six years later Sakanaction is still playing their part. Their latest single Shintakarajima (above) is a catchy, anachronistic track whose music video pays tribute to the variety shows of the 70s and 80s. The title is also a nod to manga genius Osamu Tezuka’s 1947 comic of the same name. Like what you hear? You can find more of their music on YouTube (however, their record label has blocked most of their music videos from audiences outside Japan). Sakanaction is also on Twitter  Facebook and Instagram .

In Japan however, quality stereo sets remained unattainable for most, who then gravitated to a smaller, more affordable gadget: the portable record player. The devices were cheap, mass-produced players that were made, not only by electronics companies, but also toy companies and even industrial companies. Looking back on all the unique designs that came out, each was more groovier than the next. And it’s understandable why Fumihito Taguchi, a record shop owner in Tokyo, took an avid interest in these players and began collecting them. Taguchi’s collection has grown to over 100 different varieties of portable record players. Last year he even put out a photographic book of his collection, accompanied by several essays. In the book (sample pages viewable here ), Taguchi explains that most people couldn’t afford to collect records based on musical preferences. Instead, they played phonosheets that were produced locally or given away as freebies. They were sometimes not even music at all. But that didn’t matter – it was the commodification of sound and people were simply looking for something to play on their portable record players. Taguchi’s collection is going to be on display at an upcoming exhibition in Tokyo at the Lifestyle Design Center . The exhibition opens on July 30 and runs through August 28.

Water causes mold and rotting, which can compromise entire foundations of homes. But one family in Japan saw rainwater not as an unwanted intruder but simply a part of life that, when controlled, can bring you and your home closer in-tune with nature. Completed in May of 2016, the aptly titled “ Puddle ” is a residential home in Matsusaka City (Mie prefecture, Japan) that was designed by architect Masaki Yoneda . His client, a family of 3, had been inspired by their experience overseas when they lived in a villa accompanied by a small pool of water. But the openness of a villa would not provide the type of privacy needed in the dense residential neighborhoods of Japan. So Yoneda designed the home around a large, hollowed-out chimney, which would disperse light into the many rooms of the home. Inspired by the work of artist James Turrell, the architect conceived the chimney as a piece of contemporary art that residents could enter and immerse themselves in. The chimney also serves the primary purpose of bringing rainwater into the home. A round hole cut into the base allows rainwater to drip down into a small space within the home that’s enclosed by glass but also can be entered. During periods of heavy rain the puddle grows in size , while clear skies cause the puddle to slowly shrink. The structure identifies rain as a part of life, just like sun, and should be enjoyed equally. As an architect, Yoneda excels in coming up with unique ways to bring the great outdoors, indoors. He previously designed a home that incorporated a large tree in its center. The puddle home reminds us of this preschool , also designed to accumulate large puddles when it rains.

But one of its more recent reincarnations can be found in all the way in Japan, in the form of a 6-person band called Suchmos . Formed in 2013 by a group of friends, Suchmos soulfully blends elements of acid jazz and R&B with J-pop to create vintage rhythms layered with punchy pop synth. All 6 members hail from the Shonan region of Japan near Yokohama and have stylized stage names like OK and TAIHEI. The lead vocal is YONCE (Yosuke Kasai) whose clean-shaven face and slicked back short hair makes him look like he’s 16. Admittedly, the entire group are young – in their early 20s – but have already managed to find a sound and skin they are comfortable in. YONCE attributes his musical education to an uncle and bar owner: a music lover whose room is filled with records and CDs. This mentor guided him from a young age, introducing him at first to Eric Clapton and The Rolling Stones but later to Nirvana, Otis Redding and Marvin Gaye. YONCE started his first project when he was 17: a rock band called Old Joe. The group stayed together until last year when YONCE decided to call it quits and focus his efforts on Suchmos. And the concentration has paid off. In 2014 the group played Fuji Rock and the following year they signed with Space Shower Music , where they put out their debut album Bay.

But for a select group of photographers in Japan, Summer signals the arrival of fireflies. And for very short periods – typically May and June, from around 7 to 9pm – these photographers set off to secret locations all around Japan, hoping to capture the magical insects that light up the night. But we’ll let you in on a little secret. One popular spot is Senri Ryokuchi Park in Osaka.  One thing that makes these photographs so magical is that they capture views that the naked eye is simply incapable of seeing. The photographs are typically composites, meaning that they combine anywhere from 10 to 200 of the exact same frame. That’s why it can look like swarms of thousands of fireflies have invaded the forest, when in reality it’s much less. But that’s not to discount these photographs, which require insider knowledge, equipment, skill and patience. Fireflies live for only about 10 days and they’re extremely sensitive. They react negatively to any form of light and pollution, making finding them half the battle.

San means he number 3 in Japanese, although it can also mean mountain, which would explain the store’s logo. And 3 grams refers to the optimal amount of green tea leaves necessary for a pot of tea. San Grams is owned and operated by one of Japan’s oldest tea shops Marumatsu , which began roughly 100 years ago. Most teas on the market these days are a blend of tea leaves from different farms. And while each are good and satisfactory, it’s left a vacuum of knowledge around the differences between green tea.

Every project he’s done – from renovations and residential homes to urban planning – has been accompanied by detailed sketches, cross-sections and diagrams, all painstakingly produced by hand. In an age of CAD and computer-generated renderings, Tanaka’s architectural studies stand out as adding a human element to often cold, mechanical renderings of urban architecture. Over the years, Tanaka has conducted intense studies on some of Tokyo’s major train stations, known to be the busiest in the world. How, in fact, does a single piece of urban architecture support, in the case of Shinjuku Station, 750,000 people in and out per day? Well, having 36 platforms, underground and above ground arcades, numerous hallways and over 200 exits does help. And Tanaka has captured them all in this astounding rendering he did in 2005 for a magazine on train stations . Now, Tanaka’s renderings are part of a larger exhibition that just opened in Tokyo at 21_21 Design Sight . Titled “ Doboku – Civil Engineering ” the exhibition examines the infrastructure that makes our daily lives possible. The exhibition looks fascinating! It just opened on June 24 and will be on view through September 25, 2016.

Looking back on the project, each is a unique work of art, inspired by ukiyo-e but produced with a modern sense of whimsy and, sometimes, surrealism. It’s a Tokyo that the edo painters never knew, but one that, for all its pros and cons, is worth commemorating and serializing.

It’s a simple statement but also one that cuts through to the essence of the painter’s work. Sometimes it’s the shape, sometimes it’s the color. But it’s always something simple; something that anyone can easily find – a bottle of detergent, a jar of mustard, a magic marker – that catches the eye of Itadani and becomes the subject of a painting. “It’s sort of like a self-portrait,” he explains. Born in Osaka, Itadani has spent time in Toronto and also London, where he went to art school. He’s currently based in Berlin on a POLA Art Foundation fellowship but has returned to Tokyo where he’s just installed a solo exhibition at the Pola Museum Annex . Keeping true to his passion for things he likes, “ Something Good ,” as the title suggests, is a collection of colorful portraits of things that Itadani likes: a building under construction, a large crane, the boarding bridge to a plane, or even a simple flower. The magic of Itadani’s colorful, playful paintings though is that they make you look at things twice and, the 2nd time, in a brand new way.

And it’s clear that’s not going to change. But according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, plastic waste will outnumber fish by the year 2050. So, clearly something has to change. And that’s exactly what Yavez Anthonio is trying to do. For his graduation project, the advertising student created Umi Hashi : chopsticks made entirely out of plastic collected from the ocean. “With this project I hope to reduce ocean plastic and make sushi lovers all over the world aware of the threat of microplastic,” says Anthonio, a sushi lover himself. Indeed, by visualizing the problem and putting it, literally, in the hands of consumers, it forces each and every one of use to be more cognizant of the dire problems facing the seas. But the project isn’t just for the classroom. Anthonio has launched a kickstarter campaign to turn his prototype into larger numbers of Umi Hashi. And he’s partnered with Better Future Factory to create a scalable, environmentally friendly process to create the chopsticks. But the project goes a step forward to acknowledge another serious problem facing our seas: overfishing. Only restaurants that serve sustainable fish will use the chopsticks “so if you hold these chopsticks, you’ll know you’re eating sushi responsibly,” says Anthonio. It’s great that such an ugly problem like sea plastic can be turned into such a unique, beautiful product.

Can art be utilitarian? Can craft be simply decorative without serving any functional purpose? What ceramic artist Keiko Masumoto wants to do is to take that fine line and crumple it into a ball and kick it around a little. After studying ceramics at the Kyoto City University of Arts, Masumoto spent some time in a residence program at Philadelphia’s University of ARTS. She’s also spent considerable time in London where, her concept of “Kitsch Kogei” came to life. Masumoto transforms ordinary ceramic vessels by literally merging them with other seemingly-random objects she crafts from clay. Octopus tentacles wiggle out of a jug and a daikon radish looks like it’s been stabbed through a tall pot. She even went to the trouble of beautifully decorating a large flower pot with intricate vine motifs. And it would be perfectly functional if not for the large tunnel and cars going through it. “Whether art or craft, I want to offer work that is intensely consciousness of that category, that framework, to explore what I myself felt,” says Masumoto.

In 2011 he presented “Showa 88,” a look at Japan’s colorful and vivacious past, which extends into today. Last year Usui released a follow-up: Showa 92 . The photographs share a similar plasticity: pinkish-hues and saccharine-sweet compositions that shuffle the past, present and future. But in his new series the objective feels more clear. With the Tokyo Olympics approaching in 2020, Usui felt that Japan was in the midst of a “cleansing war” going on. The cleansing war had begun in 2003 under ex-Tokyo mayor Shintaro Ishihara. It was an initiative to clean up Kabukicho, a notorious red-light district in Shinjuku known for money, sex and violence. But with a tourism boom that is expected to continue at least through 2020, Japan is rapidly changing.

There are so many small things you need like calculators, scissors, stamps, bags, cash – and those are just the basics – that it’s sometimes hard to stay sane through it all. Well, Anonunoya is a Japanese online shop that sells a very specific product: tablecloths and aprons specifically designed for selling at craft fairs, or any kind of booth really. The tablecloth itself is named Anonuno (あの布 or literally, “that cloth”) and comes from very humble beginnings. Conventions are big deals in Japan – huge auditoriums and event spaces get filled with anime artists looking to sell their self-published works. The largest of these fairs (and the largest comic convention in the world) is Comiket where close to half a million people show up. In 2014, one such exhibitor asked her older sister to make her a tablecloth and the sister went a little wild. The exterior side had a clear-pocket to place pamphlets for visitors to take. The interior side had pockets for cash, pens and any other items she might need. In awe of the creation, the younger sister posted pictures of it to twitter, where it went viral. Soon she had strangers contacting her, saying they wanted to buy one. And so the older sister decided to open an online shop to sell her creation. And the name she used when she sent the original to her sister, Anonuno, stuck. Unable to keep up with demand, the sister has had to outsource some of the work to a local factory. But each tablecloth is still made-to-order and takes about 2 months after the order is placed. They come in 2 variations, “ Simple ” (2,700 yen) and “ Pocket Detachable ” (3,500 yen), a more complex tablecloth that allows the exhibitor to swap in and out differ central pockets according to their needs. The website lists upcoming dates when orders can be placed (all other times they’re listed as “sold out”) and the next dates are July 9 and then August 10.

Almost 90 years have passed and the underground network of trains has grown to become one of the world’s most complex yet well-working subterranean infrastructure systems. But times have changed. Lifestyles have evolved and, naturally, the values that society looks for in public transportation have also shifted. To keep up, Tokyo Metro enlisted Nikken Activity Design (NAD) Lab to rethink our relationship with public transportation and what a renewal of the Tokyo Metro might look like. The results of this study were first seen in late March of this year when a series of wooden benches and working stations appeared in the concourse, and on platforms, of 3 stations along the Ginza line: Tameike-Sanno, Omotesando and Ginza. The warmth of wood is not a material often associated with utilitarian subway stations. But that wasn’t the only thing that surprised Tokyo’s straphangers. The standing workstations were reminiscent of private phone booths, which had all but disappeared with the dissemination of personal devices. Each desk was equipped with a power outlet, a small mirror, as well as hooks where you can hang bags or briefcases. The wooden half-domes utilize acoustic technology that had originally been developed for auditoriums. They allow for the creation of semi-private spaces where you can talk on cell phones without raising your voice, or having to ask your counterpart to repeat themselves. What looks like a shower head is actually an LED light that helps induce a calming atmosphere. The same attention to detail went into the benches as well. Travelers often ride the subways with large bags or briefcases. The slightly elevated shelves are perfect for resting your bag, or going through it if you need to find something. Hooks underneath the shelves also allow for the space to be used to open up a laptop and finish up that presentation while you’re waiting for your train. “We wanted to create a space that connected the underground with the aboveground,” said creative director and strategist Hiraki Yasuda, speaking with Tabi Labo . The team at NAD specializes in what they call “activity design;” in other words, innovating private and public spaces where society conducts certain activities. Activating spaces, and utilizing them to their full potential, can help make society a better place.

There, you’ll find a peculiar Japanese sweet called . Indeed, it’s a suicide-themed desert that borrows its name the Japanese ritual suicide of stomach-cutting (also known as ) that dates back over 800 years. But for Yoshihisa Watanabe, the 3rd generation proprietor of Shinshodo who came up with the idea, the ominous dessert was more about remembering history than creating sensational sweets. Monaka are traditional Japanese sweets made from sweet azuki bean sandwiched between 2 wafers. Today it comes in many shapes, sizes and fillings. In an interview with Hangame , Mr. Watanabe explains how he came up with his Seppuku Monaka, whose shape resembles an abdomen being sliced open. The original idea came to him 20 years ago when he suddenly recalled an interesting fact about the location of his historic shop. It had been built on the same ground where, in 1701, Asano Naganori was ordered by the shogunate to commit . This triggered a series of events known today as Chushingura , and is one of Japan’s most well-known, retold stories. Watanabe instinctively knew that he needed to create a Seppuku-themed desert. However, he was met with staunch opposition from his wife, his mother and even his customers. In a survey he conducted amongst people in his neighborhood, 118 out of 119 people thought it was a bad idea. Unrelenting, Watanabe pushed on. But he was careful not to invest too much in his idea. And at first they didn’t sell at all. But one day the branch manager from a stock brokerage came into his shop. A stock he had recommended to one of his clients had blown up and he was looking for something to express his apologies. Jokingly, Watanabe told him about the Seppuku Monaka. The manager bought the deserts and returned 1 week later saying his client got a big kick out of it and accepted his apology. The story travelled by word-of-mouth until one day the Nikkei newspaper visited Shinshodo to interview Watanabe about his creation. The story ran with no mention of the historic events behind the dessert, only that it had been used to express apologies. Suddenly, the Seppuku Monaka took off. The nation now had the most appropriate gift to go along with their deep bows of apology. Watanabe sells, on average, 2000 Seppuku Monaka per day. On good days he sells 6000 – 7000.

At least, that’s how we would describe the music of Charan Po Rantan in 5 words or less. The band of sisters, Koharu and Momo, have been rocking out since 2009 but their history dates back to a when elder sister Koharu went to see a circus at age 7. Impressed and astounded by the accordion player, she immediately ask for one too and has never looked back. The duo’s unique sound and style, which blends the festive music of Ashkenazi Jews with theatrical atmospherics of a circus, are somewhat of a rarity on Japan, to say the least. And it’s become a source of attention both at home and abroad. They count Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey as fans, which has actually helped legitimize their unconventional antics in Japan. They made their U.S. debut in 2013 at SXSW and then returned in 2015 to make their NY debut at Japan Society where they performed a crowd-pleasing rendition of the Super Mario Bros. theme song . In 2014 they surprised their fans by signing with Avex, Japan’s biggest recording label. But that hasn’t diminished their sound or style. Their 2nd major album, “Onna no yonju-ropun” (A girl’s 46 minutes) is as eclectic and enjoyable as anything they’ve made, packed into a dense – you guessed it – 46 minutes. Oh and their outfits? They design them, themsleves and then pass the sketches along to mom and grandma, who bring them to life! One of our favorite tracks on the new album is “I can’t be Tailor,” a reference to Tailor Swift that even rifts on the pop-artist’s hit track “Shake it off.” (Here’s an English translation of the lyrics) Like what you hear?

But these miniature models are works of art in their own right. But these models are only occasionally made available to the public: they’re pulled out of storage only when an architect is featured in an exhibition. But finally, Japan is getting its first museum dedicated to miniature architecture models. On June 18, 2016, Archi-Depot will open on Tennozu Isle in Tokyo’s Shinagawa district. Boasting a 450 sq m (4840 sq ft) space with 5.2 m (17 ft) ceilings, Archi-Depot will be lined with over 100 shelves all dedicated to the permanent display of architecture models. According to Fashionsnap , the organization has already secured models made by architectural luminaries like Kengo Kuma , Jun Aoki and Shigeru Ban , as well as a younger generation of architects like Wonderwall and Torafu . And they’ll continue to add to their collection. Each model will be accompanied by a QR code that you can scan with your smartphone to bring up more information like photos of the completed work. The space itself is operated by Terada Warehouse , a company that specializes in the storage of valuables like art and wine. Tennozu Isle, where Archi-Depot is located, was previously an industrial hub for airlines and freight companies because of its proximity to the water and Haneda Airport. But the area has undergone significant redevelopment in recent years in an attempt to rebrand itself as an isle with “ art & heart .” Terada Warehouse has played their part too, repurposing some of their ground floor space.

Several months after the earthquake and tsunami, the Japanese artist, born in Tokyo and based in Ibaraki, traveled to disaster-stricken Tohoku as an artist, rather than a tourist. Although he brought along a camera and notepad, “I refrained from opening my sketchbook and taking pictures,” recalls the artist. Seeing the survivors restoring their communities and wiping away their grief had a profound effect on Kawase. “Rather than illustrating the direct impact from visiting the destruction for myself, I decided to create a work to portray my experience of the disaster, memory of the lost lives, and the optimistic outlook to rebuild.” Yoshihito Kawase was first runner up in the 2016 Ronin | Globus Artist-in-Residence program , for which Spoon & Tamago was a judge.

If the broken pieces of ceramics could talk, some would tell you that they fell off a ship. Others would tell you they were swept away by a tsunami. Some might even simply have been thrown away. But rather than focus on their tragic state of being, and how they got that way, Kamoshita looks to the future; the revival. “I wanted to revive what wave have brought us,” she says.

In order to reign in widespread male and female prostitution, in 1617 the government restricted prostitution only to this area, located just North of Asakusa. To this day Yoshiwara remains both a historic landmark but also an active red-light district, and has gone on to inspire many popular works of cinema and literature. But for designer Yayoi Okano, Yoshiwara was more than just a neighborhood known for its sex trade. It was home. Okano grew up in Yoshiwara where, despite its reputation, people looked out for each other. She recalls her and her friends getting to know the barkers who stood out on the street trying to get male clientele into their establishments. They’d talk to her and her friends, offering them water if they were thirsty. Last year Okano decided to create a brand of Yoshiwara-inspired souvenirs called Shin-Yoshiwara (shin means ‘new’). Together with her friend and designer Daisuke Yokoyama they came up with a fitting logo that proudly represents what Yoshiwara stands for. The pair of female breasts carries the characters of the name inside them, and is simple and classy without being overtly erotic. It’s a brilliant logo that doesn’t run or hide; it stands proud of its heritage. Aside from the logo, Okano designs every item herself. And after a grassroots movement of selling her souvenirs at local shops in the area, she’s finally found a space where she and her designs can call home.

She collected all sorts of memorabilia on her trip from foreign newspapers and ads to magazines. But one observation that had a profound effect on her was the realization that the ocean, and all its treasures, connects the earth. Two years later the traumatic earthquake and tsunami struck the Japanese region of Tohoku. And 5 years from then, Morigo has returned to the subject, looking at it face-to-face in a new series of miniature collages. “The sea creates rainfall and brings water to us, nourishing us with minerals and seafood. The sea supports us through many ways and we would not be able to exist without it,” says Morigo. “That same sea is what took so many lives in the tsunami.” The artist uses a wide range of multimedia – everything from snippets of foreign newspaper and magazine to materials like mineral pigments, powdered brass, powdered pearl, and copper powder – to create collages that illustrate the ocean that connects all. Indeed, the various pigments and languages that appear in each images only adds to a sense of being connected.

Ishihara, who runs a successful landscaping business in Japan, had to arrive with plenty of time before the show. That’s because he travels all over Europe sourcing suitable plants before constructing the actual garden. This year he presented “ Senri-Sentei ,” a garden for an antique car enthusiast “with the planting designed to complement the vehicle.” Garages aren’t typically associated lush greenery and the blend of nature with a motor vehicle was risky but paid off – Ishihara was awarded a gold medal in the Artisan Gardens category, where he typically competes. The two-tiered structure is divided into essential space for the car but also a room for the family to relax. The roof serves as the main garden. Ishihara has been participating in the Chelsea Flower Show since 2004 but he wasn’t always a favorite. Japan, because of its humid climate, has a very special connection with moss. It’s used all forms of gardening from landscaping to bonsai. “It has been difficult to make them understand what moss means to us,” said Ishihara, speaking about London’s flower show in an interview from 2012. “The air in the UK is drier and moss doesn’t grow here, so it is hard to convince the judges that moss is a normal element of a garden.” But Ishihara kept at it.

In 1908 Genthe followed his passion and interest in ukiyo-e prints, sparked by a chance meeting with Japanese art scholar Ernest Fenellosa , and traveled to Japan where he spent 6 months touring and photographing the country . The images, part of a larger collection, were later acquired by the Library of Congress , where they remain preserved, offering a rare and authentic view of what Japan looked like almost 100 years ago. However, photographing Japan the way Genthe did was not easy. As author Terry Bennett describes in his book Photography in Japan 1853-1912 , Genthe was “a natural linguist” and “he had mastered a reasonable amount of colloquial Japanese. He studied, and learned, 300 kanji.” However, methodical preparation on Genthe’s part simply wasn’t enough and a large amount of success can be attributed to luck. Simply by fate, Genthe encountered “an elderly gentleman on vacation with his son and daughter-in-law” and was able to convince them to accompany him on his travels by offering to pay for all their expenses. “Genthe later recounted in his autobiography that their presence meant the he ‘saw and learned a great deal about the real Japan that without my new friends would have remained unknown to me.’ ” Unfortunately, Genthe does not detail his exact itinerary so we have no way of knowing where exactly these photos were taken but he does mention that he visited Kyoto, Shikoku and Hokkaido, spending considerable time with the friendly Ainu people. Here’s another interesting tidbit from Bennett’s book: “He had obtained an official permit to use his camera from the Japanese Minister of War, but noted that this came with a long list of restrictions. Amongst these were a prohibition on photography within a 30-mile (48-km) radius of any fortifications and a ban on photographing any place visited by the emperor. Furthermore, no photographs could be taken without first notifying the local chief of police who would then detail an officer to accompany him. .” I guess some things in Japan never do change!","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["history","Photography"],"date":"May 31, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Bespectacled Rice Made by Farmers With Glasses","content":"In a crowded marketplace, how do you differentiate your product from similar products that are all competing for attention?

Another benefit of elevating the tracks was that you free-up a lot of extra space underneath the tracks. But how should the city utilize all this new space? Shaded from the sun, these dark and sometimes dreary spaces have been turned into bicycle and car parking. Surprisingly, where the sun doesn’t shine turns out to be an ideal setting for a garden.

But it’s a phrase the means ‘entirety,’ or ‘from beginning to end,’ and it’s helpful in understanding the artist, who was born and raised in the mountainous region of Nagano prefecture. His work is inherently connected to ancient concepts of Shintoism but he uses Japan’s rich history of art and culture, not as a crutch, but as a key to unlocking unique and subtle forms of contemporary Japanese art. “Historically the Japanese believed that there existed many gods that inhabited everything around us, holding the ability to hit us with fearful awe-inspiring power,” says OZ. “Similar to water, they have no real concrete form.” OZ summons these gods of nature – a byproduct of his youth spent in the mountains – in creating a diverse body of work that is both surreal and abstract. His diversity is apparent in the fact that he’s been commissioned by several Shinto shrines to recreate large paintings that date back hundreds of years, while also conducting live painting performances, commissioned street art and large murals.

The bags will come in 5 different styles utilizing prints that span 40 years of work: Butterflies (1955) , Flowers (1964), Banana (1964), Cow (1966) and Camouflage (1987). The Andy Warhol randoseru will go on sale at Isetan Department Stores across Japan beginning June 15, and will be priced between 78,840 yen (about $740) and 89,640 yen (about $840). Although the bags won’t be used until next April when newly minted 1st-graders enter school, this is a common time to market randoseru. That’s because summer is often when parents take their children to go visit the grandparents. And it’s an unspoken agreement that the grandparents will then cough up the cash to buy their grandchildren a randoseru!

Looking somewhat like a sleek laboratory, the door had a large orange cross and the window was lined with orange prescription medication bottles. A neon sign glowed with the words “For FREE.” What was being given away for free were vitamins to supplement the nutrients people weren’t getting from eating typical fast-food like burgers, pizza fried chicken and ramen. All you had to do to get your free supplements is bring in a receipt for any fast food purchase, which was not difficult considering the abundance of burger joints, fried chicken shops and gyudon (beef bowl) restaurants in the neighborhood. Lab “pharmacists” would then analyze your intake based on the receipt and give you a bottle of vitamins and nutrients to supplement what was missing. “To fast food lovers, who is also health conscious,” reads the tongue-in-cheek slogan. “No need to worry! Just take our supplements after eating your fast food.” By placing vitamins into the hands of fast food-eaters the entire process was meant to visualize the detriments of fast food. Behind the elaborate yet clever pop-up shop , which was open for just 6 days, turned out to be an unsuspecting and ironic mastermind : a Japanese fast food chain called Dotonbori . Except, instead of Japanese fast food like ramen, gyudon and takoyaki, they offer okonomiyaki and monjayaki: pancake-like foods that are considered a healthy fast food because they often include fresh vegetables. In fact, the punch line comes at the end when the medication bottle for okonomiyaki is presented as being empty. “Looks like fast food. But 0 tablet” We’re not entirely convinced that okonomiyaki are the cure to modern unhealthy eating habits. They’re typically served with heavy sauces and mayonnaise loaded with sugar and fat. However, they certainly provide a more balanced meal than most fast food and this clever campaign, which came to life with the help of design studio Kaibutsu, helps make that point.","post_categories":["Architecture","Interactive/ Technology"],"post_tags":["food","okonomiyaki","ramen"],"date":"May 13, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Rare Photograph of Rainbow Contrails Created by Cloud Iridescence","content":"Earlier this month Japanese CG artist and photographer Yutaka Kagaya ( previously ) was perched atop a hill in the village of Oshino near the foot of Mt.

Going by the moniker talapz , the Lego master created the Himeji Castle replica over a span of 15 months. No other forms of connectors, bolts or adhesives were used: only Legos. It’s mesmerizing to watch the Lego castle rise up and begin to take shape. The most difficult part, writes talapz, was controlling the weight, which clocks in at 12.5 kg (28 lbs).

And if Dr. Okajima has her way, the company could create a never-before-seen light show for the opening ceremony of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. “Astronomy in Japan is supported by large amounts of government assistance,” says Okajima. But she wants to change that by creating a sustainable business model that could generate profits but also contribute to the advancement of scientific research by mixing astronomy with the entertainment business. Okajima and her team are currently developing a satellite that would orbit the earth while carrying 500 – 1000 “source particles.” The chemical make-up of these particles are a well-guarded secret but would serve as the catalyst for the shooting star.The different chemicals would also be capable of generating different colors. The satellite would generate a single shooting star or even a meteor shower at a precise time and location. The company plans to launch their first satellite next year and will begin marketing the service to various event organizers, one of them being the opening ceremony of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. However, the man-made shooting stars don’t come cheap. According to an interview with Okajima from last year, each shooting star would cost 1 million yen (about $9000).

Japanese celebrities have occasionally appeared on camera flaunting their ink, which has helped the art form – once reserved only for ranks of the yakuza – get its foot in the door of the fashion world. But if you look back on Japanese history, there’s a deep connection between tattoos and organized crime, which makes society’s collective disapproval understandable. However, a new form of tattooing, which draws on Japan’s anime and otaku culture, is helping change the image of ink in Japan. The trend can be traced back to 2010, writes Nikkan Spa , when a client came to a tattoo artist based in Yokohama requesting a tattoo of Fate Testarossa , a protagonist in an anime series. After it was complete the customer posted a photo on 2chan and it went viral. “At first people were calling it ‘ ‘ [from the word , which means pain] but gradually it changed to otattoo,” recalls tattoo artist Aki-Bonten . In contrast with traditional tattoos, which tend to be dark, scary and intimidating, otattoos are cute, colorful and non-threatening. It’s one of the reasons that they’re gradually becoming more accepted, even in Japan. Often associated with the rise in popularity of otattoos, Aki began studying the art of ink at age 20.  Two years later he began working professionally as a tattoo artist. In 2004 he opened his own tattoo studio Diablo Art in Yokohama. In addition to tattooing he also plays bass in a band called Days Of Oblivion. Below is some of his recent work. You can follow him on Instagram . Another artist associated with the otattoo movement is Hori Benny, who was born in Minneapolis but moved to Japan in 2002. He settled in Osaka, where he apprenticed under a master for 10 years. In 2014 he opened his own tattoo shop in Osaka called Invasion Club. He also recently co-authored the book Japanese Tattoos alongside Brian Ashcraft, editor at Kotaku .

It’s left in a pile to rot, or turned into sawdust, both of which seemed incredibly wasteful. The wood’s only fault was that it had fallen victim to Japan’s ambrosia beetle, which feeds on wood. The wormy holes left by the beetle deemed the wood unfit for consumers or home builders. But beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And for many at Oyama Lumber, the wormy wood was beautiful in its own right: a result of an entirely normal cycle of nature that rendered each piece of wood unique. Yoshihiko Oyama, the president of Oyama Lumber, wanted consumers to see the same beauty in wormy wood that he did. So he teamed up with designer Yoshiki Yamazaki to create a series of products using wormy Japanese oak. The project was called RetRe (as in “re-tree”) in hopes of breathing life back into trees once considered unusable. We’ve begun carrying two of the  vases in our shop.

The space, which became fully operational on May 1, represents an interesting trend: design agencies opening their own cafes. At Artless Craft Tea & Coffee you’ll find a sparsely decorated minimal space with an emphasis on hand-roasted tea and single origin coffee. Exposed plywood primarily covers the interior, which serves as a stark contrast to the slick, dark counter. At the edge of the counter is a cast-iron kettle that’s used to heat water.

Located in an 7-floor building from the late 60s, the artist created a unique, versatile space that functions as artist studio by day and apartment by night. Here’s a peek inside… The dilemma lay in how to turn a single, modestly-sized space into a working studio that could also function as livable quarters. To accomplish this task the maker of things had to get a little creative. In the back of the room, aligned with the windows, the artist fashioned an elevated platform out of plywood that hides a little secret. “By just pulling out the bed it becomes the best bedroom ever and at day by pushing it back under the living room, it becomes a really nice artist studio space,” explains the artist. During the day it serves as meeting area for discussions or meals but at night a concealed bed emerges from underneath the platform. It’s a really clever way to make the most out of small Tokyo spaces.  The rest of the apartment serves as a workspace for K-NARF and his girlfriend Shoko, who makes pressed-flower art.

The park was known for many things: a lake and rowboats associated with an urban legend that predicted couples who rowed together would break up, a grisly murder , and – for a short week in late March – a multitude of cherry trees whose blossoms turned the park white and pink. Of course this was pre-drone days. And so I naturally knew the park only from a pedestrian’s perspective.

The intent was to create an “exhibition space where visitors can go beyond the page and get a sense of the amount of materials that went into the production of these works.”","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["manga","torafu architects"],"date":"April 18, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"This Minimal Tube Has Everything You Need to Survive a Natural Disaster","content":"If there’s any country that knows a thing or two about surviving natural disasters, it’s Japan. The country has recovered from numerous earthquakes and tsunamis and the recent series of earthquakes in Kyushu have once again highlighted the importance of emergency preparedness. Late last year design firm Nendo partnered with hardware manufacturer Sugita Ace to create this versatile emergency preparedness kit that’s smaller than a standard umbrella. The team set out to redesign the conventional emergency preparedness kit to create something “that includes the bare minimum necessary for a city-dweller to make it to a place of refuge during an earthquake or other disaster,” explains Oki Sato, the head of Nendo. The result is Minim+Aid , a minimal, 5cm wide tube that is waterproof and acts as a floatation device. But don’t let its size fool you. Inside is a whistle (to alert others of your presence), a radio, raincoat, lantern, drinking water and a first-aid kit. It’s slim design can be worn over the shoulder, freeing your hands. And it’s also easy to store – “ just leave it in the umbrella stand or hang it from a coat hanger.”     ","post_categories":["Industrial Design"],"post_tags":["earthquake","Nendo","Preparedness"],"date":"April 19, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"A Creative Music Video Vertically Designed For Your Smartphone","content":"Stop.

And in Japan, these puns are literally everywhere . They’re in dates, they’re in advertising, they’re in business. Japan even built their famous Tokyo Sky Tree to a height of 634 m (6-3-4 can be pronounced “musashi,” which is the old name for the area the tower stands) just so that the tower could be more pun-y. Now, an artist duo are doing the impossible: they’re translating into visual works of art. Last year Photographer Ryo Katsumura and graphic designer Shun Inanuma got together and formed DAJAART , a portmanteau of the words and art. Together, they are attempting to reproduce puns , which conventionally only existed in verbal form, as aesthetically pleasing compositions. Some of these are a bit , but we’ve picked our favorites.

The word is written as 金継ぎwith meaning gold while means to connect, as in connect to the word or connect to generations. It’s the Japanese art of repairing broken ceramics using a special lacquer mixed with gold, silver or platinum. The 400-500 year-old technique seeks to fix broken things not by disguising the break but, instead, accentuating it. Two years ago Shimode and a group of artists traveled from Kyoto to Tokyobike London, where they performed workshops and demonstrated the ancient method. The workshop was documented by Greatcoat Films. “The moment in time when something has been shattered is permanently captured by the painstaking labors of a craftsman,” explains the documentary. “It is this reference to the now that recalls mushin, a lack of attachment to anything, but rather being present in the moment, something constantly available to all.” Kunio Nakamura is another kintsugi artist who has been advocating for the craft and calling on residents of Kyushu, where violent earthquakes have caused tremendous damage, not to throw away broken ceramics that have sentimental value. Family heirlooms are one-of-a-kind pieces that can never be replaced, he says, urging people to keep broken pieces together in a bag so that they can be repaired. Nakamura is the owner of 6 jigen , a bookshop and gallery in Tokyo’s Ogikubo neighborhood. When the Tohoku earthquake struck 5 years ago he helped many people repair their ceramics. In fact, some of those repairs are still ongoing. But thanks to Nakamura’s efforts, public interest in kintsugi has definitely increased, and is evidenced by the fact that a kintsugi workshop he’s hosting this weekend is sold out. Nakamura has also made a commitment to visit the regions of Kumamoto and Oita to conduct volunteer ceramic repairs. If you’re not in Japan but looking to learn more about kintsugi, or possibly try it yourself, you can start by ordering this kintsugi repair kit .","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["Ceramics","craftsmanship","kintsugi"],"date":"April 22, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Music Monday: Okazaki Taiiku","content":"Okazaki Taiiku is not your typical musician. At age 26, he’s chubby with unkempt hair and stubble. His typical uniform is a hoodie and baseball cap, which rests haphazardly on his head. He looks more like he’s been lying around playing video games, rather than making what he calls Basin Techno. It’s an odd look that is a stark contrast with his stage name Taiiku, meaning physical education (his real name is Akitoshi Oka). But looks can deceiving and perhaps that is part of the allure to Taiiku, who mixes humor with addictive beats and melodies while jumping around in his music videos out of breath, looking like he may collapse. According to his official biography Okazaki Taiiku was born in Hyogo, raised in Kyoto and is based in Nara. He’s right-handed, loves ramen and has excellent eyesight. He enjoys watching sports (but not necessarily playing them) and counts EMINEM, Passion Pit, Radiohead and daft punk as major influences. In what is perhaps the most relatable junction of his life, he first began playing music in 2004 on , a Nintendo DS game. After circling in and out of bands – most of them electronic – he began a career as a solo artist in 2012. Last year he put out a record called “Measure,” calling it his major label debut (measure and major are pronounced the same in Japanese). But it turned out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy as Taiku has recently signed on to Sony Music. The new album, which is coming out next month, includes the infectious track “kazoku kosei” (family structure) and could almost be the soundtrack of a game. As the title indicates, the humorous video explains his entire family: father, mother, sister, wife and kid. It’s unclear whether or not actors were used but, judging by their embarrassment I wouldn’t be surprised if each was played by themselves. It’s this combination of humor and relatability that makes Taiiku’s music such a joy to listen to. Like what you hear? You can find more of his music on YouTube . He’s also on Twitter and Facebook .

The winning design, which we previously knew as option A , was revealed to be designed by Asao Tokolo , a 47-year old artist based in Tokyo. The winning “harmonized chequered emblem” references Japan’s , a checkered pattern that became popular in the Edo period. It was created in a deep indigo blue, a traditionally Japanese color that expresses elegance and sophistication. It was composed of 3 varieties of rectangular shapes, representing diversity throughout the Olympic games. In an animated gif above (created by a twitter user whose spent quite a bit of time analyzing the logo) one can see how the Olympic and Paralympic versions inform each other. Previously unknown, Tokolo has now been thrust into the spotlight. So with hopes that a fate similar to that of the previous designer does not befall Tokolo, we took a look the work of the artist whose logo will be appearing everywhere throughout the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Tokolo, by trade, is not a graphic designer. He’s a pattern-maker, obsessed with joining. His work revolves around the theme of “ ,” meaning to connect. And connect it does. By using basic tools like a ruler and compass Tokolo creates individual parts that he then pieces together, creating patterns that can be repeated infinitely. The Tokolo Patterns, as they’ve been coined, merges art and math with Japan’s rich history of adopting patterns that arrived from the west via the Spice Route. In terms of application, Tokolo’s work has similarly infinite possibilities. He’s created refrigerator magnets, patterns for Issey Miyake bags as well 3-dimensional facades for commercial and educational facilities. He’s even designed a carpet for a movie theater. After graduating from Tokyo Zokei University, for 5 years Tokolo apprenticed under sculptor and artist Shin Egashira . He’s held teaching positions at the prestigious Musashino Arts University, as well as at his alma mater. He’s participated in several domestic exhibitions over the years, most recently the Measuring exhibition at 21_21 Design Sight and the Materializing exhibition at Tokyo University of the Arts. Next month he’ll be participating in a joint-exhibition at Aomori Contemporary Art Center.

Case-in-point: the recent live performance that was conducted at the foot of Mt. Fuji with a group of players.  “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” said science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke. That was the quote that inspired the name for these drones, explains creative director Tsuyoshi Takashiro . “I wanted to bring a new type of magic to the sky using drones.” So Takashiro programmed over 20 Sky Magic drones equipped with 16,500 LEDs and had them perform in front of Japan’s majestic Mt. Fuji at sundown. And the Oyamakai ensemble of Shamisen players were asked to perform, creating a mesmerizing light and sound show that’s something akin to a futuristic display of fireworks. Takashiro is a fascinating filmmaker and writer. Unfortunately, his talents have been clouded by his marriage and divorce to actress Erika Sawajiri. But in writing about his latest project he leaves us with some interesting predictions for where drones are headed in the future. “Three years ago if someone told you that cameras would soon be flying through the sky, most would not have believed them,” he says. “So I’d like to say this again: soon monitors will be flying through the sky.”","post_categories":["Interactive/ Technology"],"post_tags":["drone","fireworks","Mt.

Nakano’s deep, soulful vocals and Mori’s dexterous instrumentation create a unique sound that blends elements of jazz, ska, swing but also cabaret music from Japan’s Showa-era that will at once sound nostalgic and modern at the same time. Ego Wrappin’s music is full of atmosphere and emotion. Close your eyes and you’ll be transported to a smokey bar in pre-war Japan. I’d like you to start off by listening to one of their older songs, (Cherry in the beak) because it’s the first song I heard from them. I can guarantee it was sung extensively during many light-night karaoke sessions. But Ego Wrappin have not lost their touch. While staying consistent, and doing what they’re good at, they’ve managed to stay relevant while not sounding dull. Their latest song, , sounds just as fresh and sensual as their music did back when I was a college student.

While what you actually hear is resonance within the cavity of the shell, there’s now a seashell that plays real music. It’s been 90 years since radio came to Japan. So to commemorate that milestone the staff at Japanese radio station BayFM decided to create seashell radios. Now these aren’t just shell-shaped radios.

They then hand-crafted each one to create a simple yet poetic sound piece that can play your favorite radio station while also reminding you of the ocean. The Sazae Radio can be recharged via USB cable but then functions without a cord so as to maximize its shellness. BayFM created 100 Sazae Radios and they’ve set up a raffle.

After sifting through over 14,000 designs submitted in a public call for entries for Tokyo’s 2020 Olympics logo, the committee has revealed 4 outstanding designs that have been shortlisted. Kenjiro Sano’s original logo was withdrawn last year after a controversial plagiarism scandal so the committee has been very cautious, noting  that each design has been vetted for originality and selected in consultation with design and trademark professionals. The creators of each design have been masked and the committee is asking the public to help them decide, because no one wants to take responsibility for making a decision. I think this is our favorite. Classic, timeless and very Japanese. It references , a checkered  pattern that became popular during the Edo period. Expressed in the traditional Japanese color of indigo blue, the pattern “expresses a refined elegance and sophistication that exemplifies Japan.” We’re calling this one “Donald Trump’s Hair.” “This design expresses the connection between the dynamism of the athletes and the joy of the spectators, and the expansion of peace and harmony throughout the world,” notes the committee. C isn’t bad, but there’s nothing really special about it that stands out to us. They were inspired by the Wind God and Thunder God “and seek to convey dynamic movement at the instant an athlete breaks the tape on the finish line.” This may be our 2nd favorite, although we immediately thought “mushroom,” rather than the intended “morning glory.” But now that we see the flower it’s a nice symbol of facing up towards the sky to greet the new day. “The process of the flower growing and eventually returning to seed conveys the sense of expectation for the Games and succession to the next generation,” notes the committee. It seems like everything from the new stadium to the logo has been plagued (ie mismanaged) from that start. And for the record, we think it’s a bad idea to conduct public calls for entries for logos like these, essentially turning the process into a circus. Let’s just hope these new logos break the curse and the Tokyo 2020 Olympics can progress from here.","post_categories":["Graphic Design"],"post_tags":["Tokyo 2020"],"date":"April 8, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Music Monday: Degurutieni","content":"Degurutieni is a musician, make no mistake.

He’d often stay out all night among the riots and red lights, an experience that would go on to inspire his raucous sound and haunting lyrics.

The group, who takes their name from the fact that they often practiced in the middle of the week, are formed around the lead vocal Kom I, known for her eccentricity and slacker vibe. Making up the trio are composer Kenmochi Hidefumi and Dir. F, who plays the role of manager/director. The trio began releasing songs in 2012 on YouTube and slowly started building a following. The group’s sound, which can be described as a poppy mix of house and techno, works nicely with Kom I’s speedy raps. And their comical lyrics, which cover everything from guided bus tours and vampires to the different regions of Hokkaido, have helped them garner attention. Their music videos too, which credit goes to Dir. F, are enthralling. The first track I’m going to suggest playing is one that the trio also recently performed at SXSW earlier this month. Titled “Momotaro,” it’s a contemporary interpretation of the age-old fairytale of the same name, put to a mesmerizing beat. The slightly grotesque style of animation is the work of Otamirams , and is currently one of our kids’ favorites. The illustrators were also tasked with creating the cover art for the JIPANGU album (pictured above). Next, listen to this addictive track called “Saksaynu,” which is basically a chant of places, foods and products of Japan’s northern island Hokkaido. It’s apparently named after ancient ruler of the Ainu people in Hokkaido. Like what you hear? You can find more of their music on YouTube . They’re also on Twitter and Facebook .

Does that mean he’s getting out of retail? Hardly. In fact, he’s doubling down on unique shopping experiences by opening a new select shop called The Park-Ing and it’s located in – you guessed it – a parking garage. Fujiwara recalls an odd experience he once had of parking his car in a garage in Ginza. As he stepped out of his car he was surprised to find a Chinese restaurant right on the same floor. The experience of walking from his car, through the garage and right into a restaurant lingered in his mind and eventually became the impetus for his concept store. On his radio show last year he divulged his desire to open a store in a parking garage. Listening to that show was an executive at Sony, who reached out to Fujiwara with news that several floors in the basement of the Sony Building in Ginza were unoccupied. Fast forward about a year and last week on March 26, 2016 The Park-Ing officially opened for business. The shop is designed by Fujiwara’s go-to architect Nobuo Araki and can be characterized as a bare-bones space with exposed concrete, just like a parking garage. This helps to highlight the selection of shops that are calling the space home, which include some of Japan’s hottest apparel brands. There’s the trendy fragrance and beauty brand retaW , as well as Denim By, a collaboration between Fujiwara himself and Ryo Ishikawa’s Vanquish . A lifestyle retailer, an accessory brand and a record shop will also be included in the mix. Motofumi Kogi of United Arrows, better known as Poggy, will have his own space as well called “Poggy’s Box.” On B3, Cafe de Rope will serve artisanal toast and coffee to those in need of a rest.

Just yesterday the government doubled their estimates for annual number of tourists by the year 2020 from 20 million to 40 million. And one step they’re taking to make Japan more accessible is to redesign the pictograms used on maps to be more foreigner-friendly. Earlier this year the GSI (Geospatial Information Authority of Japan), in an effort to improve some of the country’s pictograms that are only recognizable to the Japanese, announced an initiative to redesign many of them. And now they’ve officially finalized designs for 15 pictograms that will begin to be incorporated into maps. Most of the changes are understandable, but it’s going to be sad to see the postal code sign 〒 become a generic letter. But on the flip-side, the organization decided to leave Japan’s manji symbol 卍 unchanged. The symbol, which indicates Buddhist temples, is often confused for the Nazi swastika and many groups had urged Japan to change it. But a counter movement to leave the symbol unchanged and educate tourists instead took root, which seems to have had an effect on the final decision.","post_categories":["Graphic Design"],"post_tags":["pictogram"],"date":"March 31, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Toyota’s Stunning Concept Car Made From 86 Handmade Wooden Panels","content":"“Wood is not for cars,” lamented automobile enthusiast Jerry Seinfeld, recently. “It makes no sense.” But therein lies the beauty of Toyota’s new concept car Setsuna , whose exterior is made from 86 handmade wooden panels. Although it offers basic vehicular performance like driving, turning and stopping, the Setsuna, named after the Japanese Buddhist word for “moment or “instant,” is not supposed to make sense. It’s supposed to make us rethink our relationship with our car as one that is something more than just an industrial product loaded with the latest technology. Setsuna (刹那) comes from the Buddhist concept of time and is intended to remind us to live each moment to its fullest potential. Toyota’s concept car, which will debut at the 2016 Milan Design Week (April 12 – 17) will have an aluminum meter on the dashboard that counts time in hours, days and years up to 100 years.

And while many scientific examples seem to point to the truth of this profound statement, in this case it’s KAO:S that arose from chaos. By chaos I’m referring to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that wreaked havoc in Northern Japan. And by KAO:S I’m referring to the Japanese band that was founded just a month after the earthquake. Following the Japanese pronunciation of chaos (‘kah-oss’) the band was formed around members Kaori Kawabuchi (vocal/sword dance), Shuji Yamagiri (acoustic guitar/vocal) and Jack (Tsugaru-Shamisen). Kawabuchi, a professional movement actress who assisted in mapping the movement of game characters in major games like Final Fantasy, puts on quite a show wielding samurai swords and moving around the stage in an enchanting manner. What’s impressive is that the group somehow manages to stay away from kitschy performances that tourists visiting Japan might see. They clearly have no interest in being an artifact of history and have established themselves as a thrilling, modern rock band. KAO:S has been a regular at SXSW for the past several years and they were planning to keep the tradition going this year. However, upon arriving at customs they were unfortunately denied entrance into the U.S. It’s unclear what the exact reason was but 2 other Japanese bands who were supposed to play at SXSW were also denied entry . It’s a shame that artists are being denied entry, especially when they’ve already travelled that far. NPR Music’s Bob Boilen joked that perhaps it was their swords that caused the problem.

Taking pity on the farmers, in the early 1600s an Edo government official traveled to the region bringing with him skilled blacksmiths to teach the farmers how to make hand-forged nails to supplement their income. As new forging techniques were introduced, specialized blacksmiths and their products started seeing more demand. The river that once brought havoc now brought merchants and 400 years later Sanjo is known as a “Blacksmith Town.” It’s here that Tadafusa , an esteemed manufacturer of hand-forged knives, has opened a shrine-like showroom. “Knives do not consist solely of blades,” says architect Ysuke Seki , who was tasked with communicating Tadafusa’s philosophy and product into a spatial experience. The wooden handle and cutting board are also integral to the knife and this is where Seki focused his attention. Tadafusa had developed a specialized antibacterial carbonization method for their use spruce, which went into the handles and cutting boards. Seki decided to use that same material to create an attractive display case and central table. By abandoning conventional designs for knife display cases, which are cold, shallow, and locked away behind glass, Seki managed to imbue a more human element. “The sliding glass doors remain, but the ‘case’ itself is meant to be entered, not merely opened,” explains the architect. “The thinned-out assortment of knives is at once both more attractive and user friendly, the horizontal orientation more intuitive.” Tadafusa’s shop sits adjacent to their production factory, and welcomes both beginners and experienced knife users. Tours of the factory can be arranged prior to visiting. They also offer knife sharpening services if you want to bring along a few old knives. The shop is located at 27-16 Higashihonjoji and are open from 9:00am – 6:00pm Monday through Saturday.

Japanese realistic fake food samples, of course, which have become almost as famous as the country’s delectable cuisine itself. Artists have taken aim at the ubiquitous samples that sit outside restaurants, creating jewelry and smartphone cases . But none have gone the lengths of Ayako Fudamoto, a Kyoto-based artist who is currently in the midst of her first solo exhibition. Fudamoto, a recent graduate of Kyoto Seika University’s sculpture program, hand-makes all of her food samples from clay. The imitation food samples – unique sculptures in their own right – are then assembled to create larger sculptures that often manifest in grotesque portrayals of the food industry. In “Beef or Beef,” a large cow appears to be emerging from a wall. One of its front legs is made from various food samples that use beef as an ingredient and the food is wrapping itself around the cow’s body. Another piece, whose title translates to “I can’t sit there,” is made from various chicken dishes and is inspired by an urban legend of a 4-legged chicken. In “Linkage,” a wall-mounted installation of roughly 50 bentos, Fudamoto draws on her experience from working in a convenience store bento production facility. During her shifts she witnessed massive amounts of food being produced, but also discarded, she told Kansai Art Beat , and this went on to inform her work. Our vital need to continue eating, contrasted with our aversion for spoiled food, as well as various problems within the food industry, are overarching themes that permeate her work.

By incorporating art and technology into his practice he’s managed to make revolutionary advances in a series of futuristic ideas that led to accolades from all parts of the fashion and art world. “Issey Miyake’s work stems from a challenging yet elementary question: how to wrap the body, which is three dimensional, with fabric, which is two dimensional, without forgetting that the body is also alive and moving.” Now, a new exhibition at the National Art Center in Tokyo reflects on almost a half century of work by Miyake Issey. “Miyake has always explored the relationship between a piece of cloth and the body,” says the museum curators, “and the space that is created as a result, unrestricted by any existing framework.” The exhibition expands on this this concept, incorporating a surprisingly wide range of artistic problem-solving, by arranging the space into 3 different spaces: Room A, B and C. The spaces themselves have been eloquently put together by long-time collaborators and friends Tokujin Yoshioka and Taku Sato. Designed by Tokujin Yoshioka, Room A begins, aptly, with Miyake’s early works. “For Issey Miyake, the dialogue between body and clothing consists at once of presence and absence, in the sense that the shape of the clothing is created by the body itself, only when it is worn, with the space between cloth and body being of uttermost importance. ” He created a jumpsuit with a tattoo motif that looked literally like a wearable second skin.  Room B, also designed by Tokujin Yoshioka, focuses on the 1980s when Miyake presented his “Plastic Body” collection in Paris. Here, the hand of Tokujin Yoshioka is most apparent, as the designer created a series of manikins using translucent acrylic resin. “As if it overlaps Issey Miyake’s design principal ‘a piece of cloth’, explains Yoshioka, “365 parts cut out from a piece of board with laser cutting technique are composed as a grid structure and create a futuristic human body.”  In Room C, designed by Taku Sato, is Miyake’s most radical work. “Every day, I imagine something new, create something that has never existed, and build a new reality,” says Miyake. With out a doubt, 1 of the 5 collections on display are the innovative “PLEATS.” And each day, from 11:00 to 12:00, staff will give a production demonstration using a pleats machine! It’s a great opportunity to see how the Pleats are made.

But over the last couple of years several food scandals involving imported food, as well as domestically-produced food, has refocused people’s attention on the food they consume and where it comes from. And several restaurants have popped up around Japan, promoting this very concept. Located in Niigata, Japan, PLATE is an idyllic, arcade-like structure that houses various enterprises under a single roof. One of these is A alla Z , a restaurant serving dishes using only locally grown ingredients. This Spring it plans to welcome Pollo Nello, a market selling locally farmed produce and goods. There’s additional space the will be utilized for events as well and the structure was intentionally designed to “retain a sense of ordered chaos.” The concept was inspired by local shopping streets with elongated roofs called gangi-zukuri , which helps unite the commercial district but also serves the practical purpose of dispersing heavy snow. “The same roof links the respective spaces: the market, kitchen and event space,” explains Takuya Hosokai , the lead architect behind the project. “The building is orientated to appear as if it is submerged in the forest,” says Hosokai, “in order to help visitors detach from their everyday lives and experience the forest from the inside.” The dreamlike backdrop encourages visitors to be aware of the trees and nature around them, a reminder of where our nourishment comes from.

March brings warmer temperatures but it also brings new art shows. So why not get outside and enjoy both? We’ve put together a simple map of our top picks to see this Spring for lovers and admirers of Japanese art & design!   ( The Museum of Modern Art – through July 4) We recommend starting at MoMA in Midtown. The recently opened architecture show, “A Japanese Constellation,” focuses on the family tree of architects developed around Toyo Ito, and his many disciples. “Organized through intersecting spaces separated by translucent curtains, drawings, models, and images reveal the structural invention, non-hierarchical thinking, and novel uses of transparency and lightness that link these practices.” This is the only show on our list that requires admission.   ( Christie’s NY – through March 26) After MoMA, walk 5 blocks down to Rockefeller Plaza where, among other things, is the headquarters of auction house Christie’s. Despite popular belief, anyone can enter and see current exhibitions. And right now: a showing of monumental sculptures by Kan Yasuda. “His minimalist, smoothly undulating works in marble and bronze are critically acclaimed in his native Japan and throughout Europe.” But this show is ending soon so hurry!   ( MUJI 5th Ave – through April 24) From Rockefeller Plaza walk down another 8 blocks towards Bryant Park to the new MUJI Flagship Store on 5th Avenue. Here you’ll find a fun installation of a miniature replica of Tokyo made from 10,000 MUJI products. If you own anything from the minimal lifestyle retailer you’ll know that their products are designed to precise calculations and specifications, often with architectural elements, making them perfect for such an installation. While you’re there, take a break. Grab some lunch at Zaiya and eat at an outdoor table in Bryant Park.   ( Chamber NYC – through April 30) Next you’ll want to get out of Midtown and head to Chelsea. Your first stop: Chamber NYC, the boutique gallery of curator-selected presentations. After presenting his self-sustaining bonsai ecosystem here last year, Makoto Azuma (“the flower whisperer”) is showing a larger collection of objects that include his signature suspended bonsai, fungi coated in metal and an astroturf covered bicycle and sofa.   ( Sikkema Jenkins – through April 23) After you’ve gotten your fair share of nature art, and possibly explored the High Line, just a block away you’ll find the postwar pop artist Keiichi Tanaami showing relatively new work at Sikkema Jenkins. The vibrant, psychedelic compositions hardly look like they were done by an 80-year old artist, and are a testament to the decades long career he’s had working in a broad array of mediums. “This body of work contains powerful images drawn from dreams and memories, most notably those from his experiences as a child during World War II.”   (hpgrp Gallery – through April 9) After that psychedelic trip, wind down with some soothing antique porcelain. Head down to Tribeca (35-min walk along the river, if you’ve got the energy) to hpgrp gallery, where you’ll find on display a collection of beautiful early Imari porcelain. You’ll not only see lush colors and detailed drawings but also get a chance to immerse yourself in some history – “Before the 16th century, China succeeded in firing Porcelain and dominated the export market. However from the early 17th century, craftsmen from Korea came to Arita in Saga prefecture, where porcelain was fired for the first time in Japan. With the end of the Ming Dynasty and political chaos that followed, China was no longer able to export This led to the proliferation of Japanese porcelain throughout the world, including Europe, where having early Imari ware to display in the home held a certain status among the wealthy.”","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["makoto azuma","Muji","new york"],"date":"March 24, 2016"},{"author":"Kaori Freda","title":"Ishinomaki Stone Memorial For the Victims of the 2011 Earthquake","content":"All over the country, lives sputtered, flickered, and went out.

The Japanese believe firmly in praying for the dead, to guide their lost souls to a gentler fate and keep them from turning into vengeful spirits.  Each stone memorializes a single deceased Ishinomaki community member. A concave stainless steel plate at the memorial’s center is etched with a map of eastern Japan. Standing before the memorial, visitors can send their prayers out towards the entirety of eastern Japan, honoring deceased family members, friends, and strangers who have shared the same loss.","post_categories":["Architecture","Art"],"post_tags":["2011 earthquake"],"date":"March 7, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Beer, a Bicycle and a Purpose","content":"“I heard about Ippon Matsu Beer from one of my customers,” said Shoji Kobatake, the proprietor of a brew pub in Tokyo. He was referring to the charity initiative inspired by the “miracle pine” that remained standing among 70,000 other trees that were tragically washed away by the tsunami on March 11, 2011. Inspired by that symbol of hope, New York-based designer Kota Kobayashi embarked on a project to raise money for victims by selling his home-made beer to friends and acquaintances. “I was honestly moved by the fact that they are doing what they can to help people that are so far away from them,” said Kobatake. Two years ago Kobayashi held a fundraiser in Tokyo with the help of Kobatake. Import restrictions made it difficult for Kobayashi to bring his New York brew to Japan so Kobatake brewed Ippon Matsu Beer for the event. A charity auction took place with many brands and artists contributing items to be auctioned off to raise funds for Tohoku. One of the collaborators was Tokyo Bike, who donated 3 bikes to the charity auction, and 1 bicycle to be ridden 500 km up to Rikuzentakata in order to deliver the funds. 8 riders took turns and the entire process was documented in a fantastic video that was shown at the 5-year fundraiser that took place in New York last week.

Flowers are an integral part of weddings and a huge business for florists. But now Japan’s acclaimed tech collective TeamLab wants to ‘disrupt,’ if you will, that industry by replacing real flowers with their immersive digital floral environments they’ve become known for. Earlier this week they announced a new collaboration with the Chinzanso Hotel in Tokyo. Beginning this month the hotel will start offering a wedding plan that comes with a fully-immersive digital installation produced by TeamLab . As the title of the work “ Camellia and Butterflies for Eternity ” suggests, the installation includes an opening ceremony of hundreds of butterflies fluttering through the space to welcome the bride and groom. An illuminated walkway and an impressive display of blossoming flowers during the ring exchange are also part of the program, which promises an unforgettable wedding. The introductory cost is 65,000 yen (about $575) for the installation, which is a lot cheaper than real flowers which, on average, people spend $1000 – $2000 on.

The “ Bon Voyage ” mobile depicts a humorous scene of a UFO abducting a farmer, his cow and…one other special surprise. The “ Little Red Riding Hood ” mobile shows a scene inspired by the fairy tale. But in this version the young girl is prepared. She packs a pair of scissors just in case she’s swallowed up by the big bad wolf and needs to cut herself out. With the chandelier mobile , the artist has foregone his humor and focused on beauty. He created several dozen patterns and selected only the ones with the most beautiful shadows to create this elegant paper mobile. All are available in the Spoon & Tamago shop and are sure to add playfulness and humor to any room. Iro Ken was originally an illustrator and manga artist but he eventually began feeling an urge to animate his creations somehow. The moment, for him, came at a Hanaregumi concert where he found himself standing underneath a gigantic sculpture of birds hanging from the ceiling. He remembers being mesmerized by it and looking up at it constantly throughout the show. Days later he had created his very first mobile.

In fact, he hardly had an interest in anything at all. But he did like Andy Warhol, and to this day remembers seeing him in Japanese TV ads during the 1980s. His parents both worked as artisans in the kimono-making process and one day he took note of an applique process his mother employed by cutting out old patterns to create something new. It imbued him with the concept that kimonos and modernism didn’t necessarily need to be at opposing ends and that they could, in fact, be married together. It eventually led to the establishment of his kimono company: Modern Antenna . Using his deep understanding of the kimono, and all their different parts, Hirayama is able to strike a fine balance between craftsmanship and fast-fashion; analog and digital. By employing modern techniques where applicable, and relying on traditional craftsmanship where needed, Modern Antenna produces affordable kimonos that “take up older patterns and rework them, furnishing them with both dynamic color schemes” and geometric devices. Now, for the first time, Hirayama’s creations are on display in NYC in an exhibition titled Kyoto Kool. They’re on view to the public at Globus Washitsu through March 14, 2016.

Working with the train operator’s design team, the architect – one half of the Pritzker-winning studio SANAA – has proposed a concept for Seibu’s “Red Arrow” series that would be one with the environment, melding into the background as it travels through city and countryside. The plan represents a sharp deviation from train designs of the past, which have emphasized a bold, striking look through slick lines and bright colors. In contrast, Sejima has chosen keywords like “friendly” and “soft” to define her new vision for express trains in Japan. An initial rendering shows that a semi-reflective surface will cover the exterior of the train. Sejima has been tasked with designing both the exterior and the interior with an expected completion date of 2018 and Seibu is reportedly investing 10 billion yen (about $90 million) to make this train a reality. There are a lot of differences between architecture design and train design, the most obvious being that architectural structures stay in one place while trains move throughout the land. This is where Sejima has focused her attention, attempting to design a train that would gently be one with its environment as it travels from the mountainous countryside to the city center. This would be Sejima’s first attempt at designing a train, a task typically reserved for specialized train designers.

Tokyo and its park are beautifully portrayed throughout the film as rain and gardens prove to be reoccurring motifs. What’s also stunning is the attention to detail that Shinkai takes in recreating his picturesque version of Tokyo. But the film’s accuracy wasn’t fully appreciated until a series of stills from the film were compared to actual photographs.

The idea was to create an environment that children would enjoy moving through. “This kind of space with different height and the stairs & slide that connect them stimulate curiosity and creativity,” says the architects. An additional benefit, they say, is that the space increases the children’s activity level in daily life. “As the fact that lack of exercise of the children has caused reduction of physical ability is a problem recently, we are considering solving this problem by increasing the children’s exercise volume in daily flow unconsciously.” By raising the school to a multi-leveled space the architects managed to solve two problems at once.

These intricately wrought objects are preserved cultural relics that were all the rage as men’s fashion accessories during Japan’s Edo period from the late sixteenth century to the nineteenth century. In her book called Netsuke: 100 Miniature Masterpieces from Japan , Japanese art curator Noriko Tsuchiya details historically significant netsuke, with selections including a glowing ivory carrier pigeon to a terrifying ghoul carved in excruciating detail. Netsuke is an artform that is still practiced today, in mediums ranging from ivory and porcelain to lacquered wood and hippopotamus horn.  Apparently, during the Edo period, the government was quite strict about what townsmen could and could not wear according to their rank and social status. Tsuchiya explains that although samurai dress code was very strict, men could complement their simple uniforms “with decorative additions, providing that they were worn discreetly or were hidden in the folds of their robes.” These netsuke were fundamentally fashion accessories and aesthetic symbols of social status. To wear a netsuke , a silken cord was attached to it and then looped around the obi, which was a sash tied around the wearer’s waist. Peeking out the top of the obi, the netsuke acted as a fastener to hold a lacquered wooden container, which the Japanese called an in place as it dangled below. Some netsuke were hollow, allowing their owners to secret away forbidden or pornographic items while more ordinary objects were stored inside the .

As the designer puts it: “quietly changing the world with one tiny screw.” It’s been 2 years since Kano originally developed the  screw, along with Komuro Seisakusho, a screw factory in East Osaka, Japan. Here’s Kano: Together with the screw factory, Kano has made the screws and screw drivers commercially available. Buying a screwdriver gives you special access to uploading photos of screws as they’re planted. Others can then use the map to locate and find the screws. The only problem we can see is the price. Apparently, designing and manufacturing an entirely new kind of screw isn’t easy. Or cheap. The starter set , which comes with 5 screws is 6000 yen (about $53). A pack of 5 additional screws is 1800 yen (about $16). However, the project delivers more than just smiles on screws. It delivers smiles on children, too. For each screw sold, one dose of polio vaccine will be given to a child in need through a registered NPO . The project just began and so far there are 34 screws around the world . The majority are in Japan with a few in Asia, Europe and also the U.S. In time, the designer hopes that the smiles will spread  ","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["screws","yuma kano"],"date":"February 22, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Japanese Furniture Designer Creates Tansu Luggage","content":"Have you ever had the urge to pack up your and leave? Well if you play your cards right your will already be packed. And thanks to Yokou Yamaguchi you’ll now be ale to roll your right out of your house and onto an airplane. For those unfamiliar with the traditional Japanese storage cabinetry, originated in the late 1600s to store food and firewood. By the late 1800s the ornately decorated wooden chests were commonplace in almost every Japanese home. Now they’re being redesigned for the jet-setting traveler.  After graduating from college Yamaguchi found a job at a construction equipment manufacturer. However, the corporate environment didn’t work for him and he soon quit his job to return to his hometown: the city of Echizen. There he began immersing himself in local craftsmanship and industry, specifically the art of creating . Now, at age 40, he has his own furniture studio called furnitureholic where he spends his time creating custom-made stools, chairs and other small items. In 2014 Yamaguchi came up with the idea to merge traditional and fashion, creating an entirely new use for the cabinetry. Relying on traditional woods, metallic fixtures and lacquer, Yamaguchi continued to perfect his idea of creating a lightweight, mobile than can be carried onto trains and even airplanes. “I hope this luggage becomes an icon of Echizen Tansu,” says Yamaguchi , who is currently making plans to begin selling his creation. The tansu luggage comes in 2 types, each with a different combination of drawers. And since these are intended to be carried around outside, each drawer comes with a key.","post_categories":["Industrial Design"],"post_tags":["craftsmanship","Furniture"],"date":"February 23, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Vintage Cover Illustrations of Shukan Shincho by Rokuro Taniuchi","content":"Sixty years ago this month Shukan Shincho began publishing their weekly magazine. The inaugural issue’s cover illustration featured a young girl in kimono walking on a breezy shoreline, fighting to keep her paper umbrella from blowing away. Behind her a train with homes as cars puffed along the water with billowing clouds of seashells rising from the smokestack. It was illustrated by artist Rokuro Taniuchi – 35 at the time – who, for the next 25 years until his untimely death in 1981, illustrated numerous covers for the magazine. Taniuchi’s nostalgic, evocative and surreal landscapes (many of the archived here ) became a signature look for the magazine. Dignified and handsome, they helped establish Shukan Shincho as one of the most well-respected magazines in Japan and an essential publication for any waiting room. For its 60th birthday, or , the magazine, whose name translates as “Weekly New Currents,” put out a replica of their inaugural issue. They’ve also made an effort to digitally enhance many of Taniuchi’s old covers, making them available as limited edition framed prints . In keeping with its dignified look, Shukan Shincho was also one of the only weekly magazines ( ) to not feature pornography. It also shuns the standard practice of running a young woman in bikini on the cover surrounded by sensationalist headlines. Unfortunately, and to borrow the words of author Adam Gamble, “don’t judge a shukanshi by its cover.” I feel the need to mention that, unfortunately, Shukan Shincho does not have the best track-record in terms of journalistic practices. Despite plenty of good articles, the magazine, according to author and journalism professor Kenichi Asano, has a strange and nasty habit of slipping in “coverage that unnecessarily disparages or defames individuals and groups” as well as featuring “material designed to support nationalism” by justifying excesses during WWII. Anyway, I hate to take away from Taniuchi’s gorgeous covers so I won’t spend any more time on this but if you’re interested go read Adam Gamble and Takesato Watanabe’s “ A Public Betrayed. ”","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["history","Illustration"],"date":"February 24, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Cotte: a brand of skincare by way of sake and fermentation","content":"In Japan it’s been known for many years that sake brewers, despite their manual labor, have skin that’s soft and moist.

The people behind the places, and the stories they tell, is what makes the place special. At least according to People Make Places , a new initiative that wants to show you Tokyo in an intimate way, like you’ve never seen before. The brainchild of long-time Tokyoite and travel writer Charles Spreckley , People Make Places is a beautiful collection of unique destinations in Tokyo with a focus on the individuals who shape them: “the chef and the restaurant, the designer and the brand, the barista and the coffee shop.” One of the subjects, Hiroki Nakamura, says, “To make good things, I have to start at the beginning – at the origin – with the raw materials. I cannot just add a logo to something that already exists.” People Make Places shares this philosophy when it comes to the places that make Tokyo so amazing. It’s about going behind the scenes of the coffee shop or the club and shining a light on the people – the raw materials – the make the place what it is. People Make Places is available on different levels, for different budgets. As an iphone app it’s available for about $10, allowing you to carry their content on your phone as you venture through Tokyo. If you want something more tangible there’s a beautifully designed book , printed in Japan of course, for 8,500 yen (6,500 yen, or about $58 if you order before April).

Hailed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 2011, these islands are teeming with bright fish frolicking amongst rich coral reefs. The brilliantly colored water and sandy beaches offer visitors a range of activities: from scuba-diving and snorkeling in the rusty remains of a torpedoed ship from WWII, to fishing and sea-kayaking. While the archipelago consists of a handful of small islands, the only populated islands  are Hahajima (pop. 500) and Chichijima (pop. 2000). Chichijima is warm year-around, and in the winter, visitors will often see whales breaching and dolphins lapping after the wake of speeding boats. Believe it or not, but even though Chichijima is more than 1000 miles from Tokyo harbor, it still belongs to Tokyo prefecture. Unlike the rigid social etiquette upheld in the mainland, the laid-back nature of island culture promotes community, sharing, and a luxurious sense of well-being. There are many places to stay on the island, but by far the most aesthetically pleasing hotel is Pat Inn , designed by Kichi Architectural Design . Family owned and operated, these two modernist structures that were completed in 2015 house a total of 13 guest-rooms that range from single, double, and traditional Japanese tatami rooms, a restaurant that serves local delicacies including swordfish, a library, and a hallway gallery. Perhaps the most striking fact about Pat Inn is that it’s owner, Ken Sebori, is the great-great-grandson of Nathaniel Savory, an American, who, in 1830, was one of the first people to call Ogasawara home. (As you may have guessed, the current family name ‘Sebori,’ written as 瀬堀, is a Japanized version of ‘Savory’.) An important historical marker, the hotel sits squarely upon the land where Savory is said to have built the first man-made structure on Ogasawara.

Either way, it’s clear that the character designer and illustrator Yoshitaka Amano touched many colors of the art spectrum. A new exhibition just opened in Tokyo, and spans Amano’s fascinating career with an emphasis on his earlier work. The 63-year old artist got a career boost early on in the 1960s when he was given the opportunity to work on Speed Racer. And within 10 years he was creating iconic and influential characters like Gatchaman, Tekkaman and Time Bokan. By 1982 he had made a name for himself; enough of a name to go independent. Amano’s renown as a character designer was sealed before he even turned 30 when he was commissioned to create concept art for Final Fantasy, a game that would go on to define the lives of kids growing up in the 90s. Over 100 of Amano’s original prints and illustrations are on display at the Yurakucho Asahi Gallery, a space hidden away on the 11th floor of Yurakucho Mullion building.

For his senior thesis exhibition this month he decided to create an automaton, a moving mechanical device that performs a certain task. Kango had seen automaton’s write messages, such as the one made popular in Hugo. But instead of words, Kango thought it would be fun to create a device that wrote out the time. But even Kango himself didn’t know what he was getting himself into. And that his resulting creation titled “Plock” would consist of over 400 wooden moving pieces. The contraption is set into motion by a series of weights that push and pull on the wooden parts – an astounding 407 in total. Minute by minute, the accurate time is displayed, written by four magnetic stylus pens on a magnetic drawing board (like the ones often found in kids toys), which also cleverly resets itself.  Kango posted the above video to twitter on February 7th, which has since racked up over 170K retweets. Kango hand-carved every single one of the wooden pieces, an impossibly daunting task that probably resulted in numerous sleepless nights. But that wasn’t the most difficult part. “It was the friction,” says Kango in an interview on his school’s blog. Eliminating the friction between the cam and the arm was the most difficult. And then of course making everything move, he adds.  When asked if he has any advice for his underclassman he responded by saying that difficult tasks are proportionate to the feeling of accomplishment once the task is done. Oh, and “if you’re tired, go to sleep!” Kango’s fantastic clock, along with creations by the rest of his classmates, are on display at the Tohoku University of Art and Design campus from February 9 – February 14, 2016.

Images of old vessels that hold flowers, or used as tableware, might come to mind. On the other side of the spectrum are computer graphics and digital art, a wholly intangible media that’s made of bits and bytes. Combine these two vastly different fields and you get what artist Toshiya Masuda calls “image gap.” “People tend to judge things based on one’s experiences or acquired knowledge, as one gets older,” says Masuda, a 39-year old Japanese artist. “Since people control feelings based on old knowledge and precedent, many things become common sense in one’s mind without realizing.” The “image gap” that Masuda refers to is what he tries to achieve through his artwork by producing digital imagery using ceramics .  Indeed, at first glance Masuda’s work, especially viewed through a screen like anyone who’s reading this is, appears to be pixilated versions of ordinary objects like sneakers, scotch tape, flowers or a fried egg. Of course, upon closer observation, these are carefully composed ceramic blocks of color.

Inaugurated in August 2015, 599 Takao celebrates the mountain’s rich natural environment and unveils the interdependent relationships and inner workings of the local flora and fauna. The displays are tech and child-friendly, encouraging visitors to cultivate interaction and awe at Mt. Takao’s natural wonders. This stout mountain is home to more than 1,200 different kinds of plant life, wild boars, monkeys, and all sorts of feathered friends. Visitors who venture onto the mountain after sunset may be lucky enough to catchy a glimpse of musasabi, a Japanese giant flying squirrel, soaring overhead.

Both structures are striking reminders of the myriad ways that the living can pay respect to the deceased. Rather than dedicate the space as a religious one, these gestures designate the chapel as a place of inner spiritual reflection, no matter the visitor’s belief. Bathed in sunlight and surrounded by a lush forest of deciduous trees, the chapel offers visitors an unforgettable and breathtaking spiritual experience.  Architectural critic Taro Igarashi expounds upon the purpose of the space, explaining that, although “it is a non-religious contemplative space… [it] resembles a contemporary interpretation of a Buddhist temple and Shinto shrine”. The chapel’s deeply triangular form imitates the ancient Japanese Gassho structure, in which two pillars meet to created an inverted V to relieve the roof of heavy snowfall. The etymology of the word ‘Gassho’, in turn, refers to two palms pressed together in prayer. Moreover, the structure itself is exquisite. The steep triangular roof is clad in 21,000 delicate cast aluminum panels, and supported by more than 250 wooden beams. It is a remarkable feat of architectural engineering. Just next door, you’ll find a lovely community center that seems to float atop a calm lake. Radial wooden beams jut out over the water, while a living tree fills the hollow center of the roof.

The historic street was built in the early 1600s to run parallel with the new Takase River, which was opened to allow small boats to carry wood, coal and other goods to the city center. And because of this surge in economic activity, by the late 1700s, Kiyamachi Dori was lined with restaurants, inns, brothels and small watering holes all looking to cater to travelers and merchants. It’s an intricate network of night alleys, says architect Florian Busch , adding: “any walk here leads to eventual surprises.” However, we’ll stop there because painting an overly picturesque image of the street could be misleading. Kiyamachi and its nightlife remains a magnet for locals and tourists. But anyone who has visited in the last several years in search of old Japan has likely been disappointed. Lax regulations has allowed quick money to flow in, resulting in a major identity crisis that has manifested itself in what Busch politely refers to as “nondescript mediocrity.” In other words, ugly buildings. In a previous life, there was a small plot of land right across from Kamiyabashi Bridge where 12 bars were spread over three 2-story houses. This is where Busch, a protégé of the famed Toyo Ito, was asked to create K8 , a narrow and horizontal 8-levled structure that would reclaim the historic beauty of Kiyamachi Dori. If you imagine the horizontal sequence of sakaya, or bars, that historically occupied much of the street, “K8 is the translation of that experience into the vertical,” says Busch.

We also know that he enjoys turning everyday objects in his house – cigarettes, apples, bread – into dynamic, 3-dimensional works of art that have found an endearing home on Twitter and Instagram , where the artist posts his creations. But more than anything, Shin’s multilayered method of storytelling using paper cups has so far proven to be his most creative use of disposable materials. Shin first draws on and carves into the paper cups, an act made possible only by intricately planned scenes. He then stacks the cups on top of each other and turns them one at a time to reveal a multi layered story unfold. Watch till the end to see how he cleverly uses the inside and bottom of the cup. So far he’s used the classic cartoon character Doraemon, and the more recent One Punch Man as inspiration for his creations. Although acknowledging that its hazardous to his health, Shin also uses cigarettes, and the ash from smoking them, to create realistic portraits of famous characters. After his smoke he’ll meticulously separate the grey ash from the black ash and then use the 2 colors to create grey-scale portraits that include likenesses of Steve Jobs and Johnny Depp. Shin’s New Year’s resolution for 2016 is to stop smoking. Admitting that it’s sometimes out of boredom, Shin occasionally has been known to play with his food too. You can keep up with Shin and his eclectic artwork on Twitter and Instagram .

We certainly do. And while I’d like to say it’s because we all have such keen eyes, there’s something more to it. As Portuguese architect and curator Pedro Gadanho puts it, there’s “a Japanese constellation” of shared architectural themes and sensibilities that travel across generations of architects to create a strong regional identity. It stands in stark contrast to individuality-based “star-system” often found in the West and is the subject of an upcoming exhibition at New York’s Museum of Modern Art. “ A Japanese Constellation : Toyo Ito, SANAA, and Beyond” follows the work of Toyo Ito and the many alumni he mentored, which include the Prtizker-winning SANAA, as well as some of Japan’s most exciting up-and-coming architects. The show presents a survey of architectural production since 2000, and reveals “a network of influence and cross-pollination” which is the mechanism behind us looking at a home and saying, “yup, that’s gotta be Japanese.” Given that we’ve written about each of these architects, we’re definitely looking forward to seeing them all in New York for this show. The show will be on display at MoMA from March 13, 2016–July 04, 2016. Given that it coincides with the 5-year anniversary of the March 11th earthquake and tsunami, and that many of the featured architects have been involved in the Tohoku reconstruction efforts, the exhibition will also reflect how the architecture field is responding societal needs.

The first phase of the project began with redesigned a series of products and souvenirs that were made on the island.   For centuries, Ishigaki Island has “been home to a unique local culture that stems from a blend of the Ryukyu, Japanese and Taiwanese cultures,” say the organizers. The USIO project , which derives its name from the word ushio (潮) meaning tide or sea water, was conceived as an invitation: a project that would invite people to the island like tides of the ocean. It’s an amazing project that seems manageable only with the right kind of driving force (ie: not city bureaucrats).  And that’s exactly what is making this project viable. It’s being run and managed by Loftwork , an unconventional company that leverages its online portfolio site of artists and designers create synergies between design and local industry. Another phase of the project included designing a new website, ISHIGAKI NOW , that helps prospective visitors plan their itinerary.

Hurricanes, earthquakes and flooding were the primary issues raised that put the metropolis at risk. And in alignment with those waterborne risks, global architecture firm KPF has proposed “ Next Tokyo ,” a vision for Tokyo in the year 2045 when a mile-high tower and eco-city floats on Tokyo Bay providing home for half a million citizens and simultaneously addressing city-wide vulnerability by providing coastal defense infrastructure.  Principal architect David Malott is an architect of innovative supertall towers whose portfolio includes 3 of the world’s 10 tallest towers. And his firm, KPF, has been involved in some of Tokyo’s most recent major urban redevelopments like Roppongi Hills and the Grand Hyatt Tokyo, the Merrill Lynch Japan Head Office in Nihonbashi and Otemachi Tower. But Next Tokyo , if realized, will make all his projects look tiny: the plan calls for a 1600-meter tower (1 mile is 1609 meters), which would be twice as high as the world’s current tallest building. There’s always been a gradual increase in height for cities and Malott believes this trend will continue. Malott addresses two of the major issues with superhigh towers, one being wind (“Even in the most seismically active regions of the world, the design requirements for exceed those for earthquakes”) and the other being the distribution of water which, if pumped, could become very costly. Not only is the proposed structure remarkably aerodynamic but energy will be generated on-site through small-scale microturbines integrated at high elevations. To avoid pumping water throughout the structure a combination of harvesting water directly from clouds and rainwater catchment “can completely eliminate the need for an additional source of potable water.” Next Tokyo also plans to leverage next-generation technology currently being developed like Elon Musk’s “Hyperloop” for transporting people into Tokyo, as well as a MULTI magnetic-levitation elevator currently being developed by Thyssen pp.    Sound like science fiction? Or a make-believe story conjured up by those who dream of the future? Sort of. But the plan actually picks up were one legendary Japanese architect left off 55 years ago. In 1961 Kenzo Tange presented his plan for Tokyo Bay (1960) on an NHK TV program. The radical design called for a linear city that stretched 80 km across Tokyo Bay. Following not only in those footsteps but in that same format, Malott presented his plan during a TV program on NHK that aired in 2015. “The global population will likely continue to concentrate in urban areas,” says Malott, “most of which are situated near major bodies of water.” Next Tokyo not only builds on Kenzo Tange’s legacy but it presents a coastal megacity that responds to increasing environmental threats and sprawling urban migration trends. You can read more about the proposal in this white paper , which was published in a journal published by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.

One thing I remember about growing up in Japan was how much my Dad admired Japanese construction worker fashion, especially the baggy Tobi Trousers that the workers would wear. He always joked about buying a pair and I was always terrified that he might actually do that. But apparently he wasn’t alone. Believe it or not, in 2005 German designer Bernhard Willhelm used construction worker fashion as a theme for a fashion show in Paris . And the success of Blue’s Magazine, currently in its 4th edition, is proving that people across Japan are also fascinated by not only the fashion but the entire culture. In addition to largely focusing on the reconstruction efforts in Tohoku, and the workforce making it possible, Blue’s Magazine also shines a spotlight on foreign construction workers who have come to Japan to fill the shortage gap.

He was, of course, looking at the manji symbol (卍), a reverse swastika that could understandably be mistaken for the symbol of Nazi Germany, instead of its intended representation of Buddhist temples. Now, over 30 years later, Japan is taking steps to update and redesign some of its more esoteric pictograms in a move intended to make the country more foreigner-friendly. The initiative was undertaken by the GSI (Geospatial Information Authority of Japan) in an effort to improve some of the country’s pictograms that are only recognizable to the Japanese.

Working ever so quietly and efficiently, overnight workers had given Shibuya’s emblematic Aoyama Dori a new layer of asphalt. And in doing so, the road’s primary markings – cross walks, lane dividers, arrows – had all been replaced by minimalist, provisional “sketches.” Kofler is an architect, urbanist and writer. He’s also the cofounder of MIRU , a website and app that helps you uncover Tokyo’s architectural and urban environment. So naturally he took note and decided to document the rare transition of Aoyama Dori, which had taken on a theater-like role of indicating the position of objects and actors using pieces of tape. It was a scene reminiscent of the director Lars von Trier’s “Dogville,” which was shot entirely on stage with minimal props; buildings represented by chalk outlines. And yet this “less” was entirely sufficient in keeping the road operational. “On Aoyama Dori we were briefly reminded about the artificiality of a city and our role in it,” says Kofler, “choreographed by the rhythmic sounds of the Japanese traffic lights.”  ","post_categories":["Architecture","Interactive/ Technology"],"post_tags":["signage","Tokyo"],"date":"January 14, 2016"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Stay in the Kyoto Moyashi House: a 120-Year Old Renovated Machiya","content":"120 years ago it was an indoor greenhouse for growing koji seeds, a key ingredient in sake as well as miso and soy sauce.

Whether you’re looking for an authentic place to stay or to host an off-site seminar, the large Machiya can serve as a unique backdrop. The perfectly preserved details give you a sense of what life was like in late-1800s Japan. For example, you’ll find that the (or plot width) is incredibly narrow but with plenty of expansive depth, which is the origin of the phrase (a bed for an eel). This was because homes were taxed according to their width. You’ll also find some of the original structures and fittings that were used to grow the koji seeds. In fact, the name of the home is a reference to this heritage. “Seed malt was called ‘Moyashi’, a noun also used in Japanese language describing the growth of flowers and plants,” explains the owners. “Moyashi Machiya, or seed malt townhouse, hence takes after its name from what it has traditionally grown.” The Moyashi Machiya was renovated by 2 sisters and 1 college friend, who gave the structure a new life much in the same way that, 120 years ago, the Machiya give new life to seedlings. And in keeping with this history the owners hope to create “a site for new seeds to grow” by offering it as an overnight inn, a reception or event site or simple a place where people can come together. According to Craig Mod , who recently stayed there, the 2-story home “can accommodate a group of three effortlessly, five pretty easily, and six if you don’t mind sleeping in a row on the beautiful tatami filled first floor.” Rates vary depending on occupants and usage but to give you a general idea, 4 people can stay overnight for 50,ooo yen.

It belongs to the school of Buddhism and has been a spiritual boon to the neighborhood since any resident can remember. But the last time it had any major work done was in 1949, after it had to be rebuilt from damage during WWII. But over the last 60 years the temple had become quite dilapidated so temple leaders decided a facelift was needed to restore the cultural and sacred location to its previous glory. So the temple hired local architect Satoru Hirota to come up with a plan to refurbish the temple, create a new reception hall and also spruce up the central gate and garden. Satoru, whose name coincidentally means “enlightenment” in Japanese, proposed a combination of exposed concrete and charred cedar that would be used to create a minimalist yet organic feel throughout the new space. Tsunyuji Temple reopened in June of last year and is an exceptional work of spiritual minimalism.

Our articles aren’t always the most flashy but we spend a lot of time crafting our thoughts and typing them out. And we hope to keep doing that next year as we inch closer to turning 10. 2015 was an important year for us. While our online shop continues to grow, we also made our first step out of the internet and into real life in the form of a pop-up gallery ! Thank you to everyone who stopped by to say hi. We loved meeting you and talking with you about art and what excites us. Stay tuned for more next year! Wishing everyone a safe and happy holidays. Our most popular post this year was a new pre-school in Japan designed by Hibino Sekkei. What made the school special was that the courtyard was formulated to collect rain water instead of draining it out, creating the ultimate form of play each time it rains. Not only were readers resound in their support of jumping in puddles but the school reminded all of us how important it is for kids to play outside, even if it means getting a little wet and dirty.  At a design conference in Tokyo late in the year, MUJI announced that it would begin selling prefabricated huts for less than the average price of a new car. Starting at just $25K, we will soon be able to purchase small, designer homes that would allow us to live small but think big. The humble abodes won’t begin being selling until 2017 though…ack! One more year!  Another early-education post in the top 5 proves that it’s a topic on everyone’s mind. In this case, two Japanese designers created a paint set for kids that would make them think about color differently. Instead of names, each tube in the 10-color paint set is identified by one or more circles of color: a radical new way of getting kids to intuitively understand color. We stocked them in our shop and they sold out in a matter of days. Unfortunately the company has no plans of producing more.  Early in the year, design studio Nendo created “ Chocolatexture ,” a series of 9 chocolates, all the same size, that represent Japanese onomatopoeic words that describes texture. Words like tsubu tsubu, sube sube and toge toge were used to create chocolate with pointed tips, hollow interiors or smooth surface textures. We’re selective in covering projects from Nendo simply because of the sheer volume: in an interview this year lead designer Oki Sato revealed that at any one time he has roughly 400 projects moving forward simultaneously.  Next on our top 10 is Masayoshi Matsumoto, and artist who we definitely want at our next birthday party. Elevating the realm of balloon art and taking it to new heights , Matsumoto uses balloons of all sizes to create intricate, detailed animals and plants that appear to be made from something – anything – other than inflatable rubber.

Self-proclaimed “Babe Drawer” Kei Meguro impressed readers with her photo-realistic renderings of, well, babes. Meguro’s portraits are striking and alluring alone. But what makes them special is the post-production work of adding bits of color, which she masterfully accomplishes in photoshop.  Meet Saya. She’s not your typical Japanese schoolgirl. Her parents have big dreams for their beautiful daughter. They want her to play a character in a movie they are self-producing. Where will she find the time with all her schoolwork? Not to worry. Saya is only as real as the pixels on your screen . Her soft cheeks, lush, black hair and hazel-brown eyes are all computer-generated imagery.  Landing at number 9 is Japan’s largest treehouse, created by a treehouse specialist and an architect. It was designed around a single 300-year old camphor tree. What’s amazing is that the treehouse in its entirety , never touches the tree. It’s completely self-standing so as to not harm the tree. And good news! The treehouse is for kids and adults alike.  Coming in at 10th was a design that brilliantly captures Japan’s minimalist aesthetic. Created by design duo YOY, the lamp comes flat-packed, like paper normally does, but the cuts and incisions allow it to take form as you use tacks or tape to adhere it to the wall.

The plan is for a stadium that is in tune with the surrounding environment and utilizes the latest technology to create a modern interpretation Japan’s climate, culture and tradition, reads one of the statements. Interestingly, when you look at how both stadiums scored among the judges it was quite close with Proposal A (610 points) winning out over Proposal B (602 points) with a mere 8 points. From a design perspective Proposal B actually scored higher. The biggest delta came from the “shortening of construction period” category in which Proposal A gained 27 points over Proposal B. Clearly the committee was concerned over timing and wanted to ensure that the stadium was completed in time for the Olympic games. However, the original mishandling of the process–everything from the firing of Zaha Hadid to the lack in transparency–has left a bad taste in the mouths of those involved.

A building designed by Kenzo Tange in the 1970s that houses, among other things, a rock garden by Isamu Noguchi, has been partially taken over by design studio nendo’s own offices, as well as a coffee shop produced and managed by the Tokyo and Milan-based design firm. It’s like old world and new world masters being united by coffee. Connel coffee is located on the 2nd floor of the Sogetsu Kaikan in Akasaka, a building designed for the Sogetsu school of Ikebana. Situated across from the imperial crown prince’s residence, it boasts picturesque views of the Korekiyo Takahashi Memorial Park. The name of the café is a play on the word , meaning “to knead” or “to mold” in Japanese. It’s a clever reference that connects back to nendo , which means clay. The café’s logo and branding, also produced by nendo, has been designed by taking the “n” from the nendo logo and bending it to form two “c”s. The coffee shop is, of course, being added to our Tokyo Guide . The building was designed by Kenzo Tange, described by nendo as “one of the pioneers of modern Japanese architecture.” Following in Tange’s steps – his own offices had been located on the 10th floor of the building until his death in 2005 – nendo has recently relocated their offices into the Sogetsu Kaikan. And in doing so, they’ve opened a coffee shop that’s open to the public. Their offices, obviously, are not. In order to preserve much of Tange’s original architectural flavor, features like walls and ceilings have been left untouched. Only the floor and furniture has been redesigned. “The tops of the counters have been finished in a gloss black to match the grey mirror finish of the ceiling,” explains nendo, and the original tulip chairs and tables designed by Eero Saarinen have been repaired for reuse under nendo’s supervision. The Sogetsu Ikebana School, and its sibling organization The Sogetsu Art Center (SAC), played a fascinating role in Japan’s art scene as a major hub for avante-garde activities in the 1960s.

Sushi Police (pronounced sushi-porisu) is a lively 3DCG animated television series inspired by the real-life drama that happened in 2006 when the Japanese government attempted to authenticate global Japan cuisine and prevent bastardized sushi like Los Angeles’s famous California Rolls. On a larger scale, Sushi Police asks a pressing question- what rights does a country have to its cuisine once it has left the border? Cross-cultural culinary pollination can create startlingly delicious new recipes but can also have drawbacks. Back in 2006, officials were especially worried about the low standard global restaurants were setting, anxious that it reflected badly on Japanese culture. In a Washington Post article from 2006, the Japanese agriculture minister Toshikatsu Matsuoka spoke in regards to his “Japanese restaurant authentication program”, explaining “What people need to understand is that real Japanese food is a highly developed art. It involves all the senses; it should be beautifully presented, use genuine ingredients and be made by a trained chef,” he continued. “What we are seeing now are restaurants that pretend to offer Japanese cooking but are really Korean, Chinese or Filipino. We must protect our food culture…We take our food very seriously.” If you’ve ever watched the movie Jiro Dreams of Sushi , then you know the great care and mastery required to create a single slice of sashimi. In Japan, it is a rough reality that good sushi is also expensive sushi. In the story, Japan created WFCO (World Food-culture Conservation Organization) and sent inspectors from the 9th division, known as the “Sushi Police”, to judge whether Japanese fare overseas is authentic. The series features three sly yet somehow lovable inspectors who portray the prototypical Japanese businessman workaholic. These three men in ties and suits are Captain Honda, Suzuki, the brains, and Kawasaki, the android officer.  The game even has a cat called Madam Fuji, who is a snooty looking Persian cat with tiny eyebrows sporting a spotted ribbon and full geisha headgear, including specially waxed hair and a traditional kanzashi comb. With an intriguing cast, roots in reality, and delicious plot twists, Sushi Police promises to be a wild ride. Already, it has won the 2015 Cannes Poster Awards. Its inception marks the 20th anniversary of TOKYO MX. On January 6th, shortly after the Japanese New Year, the animation will begin broadcasting. Sushi Police will show every Wednesday at 1 am on TOKYO MX. On January 7th, it will be distributed on a plethora of platforms including Google Play and Amazon.

And photographers have accepted the challenge, each capturing Tokyo–at its best and at its worst–through their own frame of vision. For designer and photographer Rie Miyoshi , that meant creating complex double-exposure photographs to capture her equally complex city she has come to know as home.  Miyoshi was born in the Malaysia but grew up in Japan. After moving to Hawaii for college she’s now back in Tokyo where she works in media while freelancing as a designer and photographer . For Miyoshi, Tokyo can be inspiring, but it can also be dark and lonely. And she tries to express this dichotomy through her photographs. Writing about “Exposure” (above) Miyoshi says that she encountered a drunk father physically abusing his daughter on the street. “December is a festive month for most of us, it can also be a bad time in Japan,” she says, speaking about the hectic holidays and the many layers of stress. “My heart ached when I saw how many people passed by, looking the other way and pretending like it was any other 7 p.m. evening in a friendly neighborhood.” “Ironically, living in a big city with all its busy-ness and attractions and opportunities for success make it easier to get less involved with other people’s lives and have fewer connections on a personal level. ” Indeed, it’s an important reminder for us all, especially around this time of year, to slow down and look beyond what we see on the surface. 2016 is the year of the monkey, which is often associated with the proverbial principle “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.” But instead of turning a blind eye, let’s all try and reach out to those around us.

Tsuchiya Kaban , a leather workshop located in Nagano Prefecture, has dedicated the Otona Randsel line towards elevating the idea of the school bag to new heights, using only the finest quality materials. These leather knapsacks are created using the Italian Baketta method, producing exceptionally functional and stylish bags. They reference an entire tradition of European backpack wear, but Otona Randsel adds a neat Japanese twist with linear contours and neat pockets. Glowing with natural luster, these lightweight bags are high-performance: not only do they function in day-to-day use but will impress coworkers and bosses alike in a professional setting. Over time, the leather will begin to feel like the hand of a familiar friend, although an inanimate one that you can sport on your back. Adjustable leather shoulder straps and a padded back ensure premium comfort level for the wearer. No two of these leather bags are ever the same, for the soft leather accrues unique markings over time. These bags are a prime example of excellent craftsmanship; their functionality shines through from the meticulous hand-rolled corners to the clever side flaps designed to keep out the rain. Moreover, they are lightweight, require no oil treatment (although waterproofing is recommended) and can easily hold a 13″ laptop, a few books, and any important documents you might need to tuck away.

Taking inspiration from 17th-century artist Tawaraya Sotatsu’s , or Japanese artist Taro Yamamoto has recreated a dramatic standoff between two rivals. Yamamato substituted Star Wars’ Rey and droid BB-8 for Fujin, the Wind God, and the deadly Kylo Ren for Raijin, the Thunder God. Armed with lightsabers, they float on wispy clouds hovering over a stunning golden foil backdrop as they prepare to duel to the death. The screens’ unveiling pays tribute to the 400th anniversary of the birth of the Rinpa school of Japanese art, renowned for its dynamic compositions and flamboyant use of precious materials like gold leaf and pearl inlay. At the screens’ opening, Stormtroopers, in the flesh, stood guard beside a calligraphic scroll by kanji artist Seihan Mori, who is also the temple’s chief priest. The writing on the scroll spells out 覚醒 ( ), or “awakens,” riffing off of the title of the incoming Star Wars movie.

Although only 29, the young artist’s work is currently the subject of a solo exhibition in New York City. Ideguchi’s classical training in Japanese Painting is clear in his craftsmanship and the decorative nature of his work. But what adds to the dynamic and intrigue are the unconventional splatters of spray paint, the masterful compositions and how they work together with symbolisms of life and death. In fact, Ideguchi points to “the hybrid self-identity I carry as a Japanese” in explaining his aesthetic. He acknowledges Japan’s diverse history, especially in the form of religion as Shintoism, Buddhism, Taoism and even Christianity converged. But one Buddhist doctrine in particular, that of (諸行無常), had a great impact on the artist. The concept “teaches that all things are in flux and nothing is permanent,” explains the artist, and that it resonates so strongly because natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis are so tied to Japan’s history.

Finding a shop in Japan which ships abroad is hard enough, but the Casio S100 appears to be sold-out everywhere. Even with the aid of Google Translate, the mission feels hopeless. Enter White Rabbit Express, a Tokyo-based buying service for Japanese products. I’d used them before to buy a Porter wallet , and their bilingual staff are fast, friendly and informative. Over live chat they explain the calculator is on backorder and will be available again in January. I pre-order the item through their straight-forward website. products are a thing of the past.

Faced with a dwindling clientele, the inn recently decided to invest in their most valuable asset, their (or hot spring). LEDs illuminate the space underneath the cypress walls. Water from the nearby hot springs stream from a small copper spigot set into the wall. The inn asked KuboTsushima Architects to redesign their bathhouse in order to “increase the sustainability of a long-established hot spring inn.” The resulting wooden chamber, with gentle light streaming in at angles from slats in the ceiling, creates an welcoming space that invites guests to relax and rejuvenate. The space allows guests to fall into a light and peaceful slumber, immersed in perfectly heated water. The bathhouse sits between two wings of accommodation, and comprises of a large rest area, with the bath below. The high sloped ceilings add a breathe of fresh air to the environment, and make it even easier to relax. Planed raw cedar decorates the majority of the bathhouses’s ceilings and walls, with the exception of the resting area’s aromatic bench. The architects had something really specific in mind here, as they “used Japanese cypress wood,” said Kubo. “It has pleasant aroma, and it makes people relaxed who recline on the bench after bathing.” Few other onsens or natural hot springs offer this sort of cutting-edge immersive environment. As well as being incredibly stylish, the architects have constructed the space with a keen eye for ways to introduce natural light and ventilation. After guests have soaked for a long while, they can rest on a second, more shallow platform within the bath. There, they can sit or recline, with their heads settled upon the uppermost part. The knots in the ceiling’s wood grain offer a mesmerizing place to rest the eyes. Aromatic scents rising up from the cypress bench fill the air with a pleasing aroma, while the floor slopes up into a wall to create a single curved surface,  gently supporting a guest’s back. Guests can head to this section of the bathhouse after having soaked, to sit and enjoy the cool air flowing in.

On a personal note of remembrance, when I was living in Koenji as a child in the early 80s we didn’t own a television. So, as a small white kid in Tokyo, I would make my way through the winding back streets of the dense suburb to a friend’s house and we would watch together. By the time the show was over at around 7:30pm the sun had set and my path home was only partially illuminated by sporadic street lamps. I don’t quite remember if my parents came to pick me up or if I would walk home alone, but what I do remember is seeing Mizuki’s in the dark corners of the path where the street lamps neglected. Strangely, I wasn’t scarred in their presence. They watched over me and protected me from robbers, murderers and all the other chaotic possibilities of life which, even as a child, felt so much more dangerous. But more recently, one of his most memorable works was this powerful illustration (above) that appeared in the NYT just 9 days after the 3/11 earthquake and tsunami. The horrific image depicts a hand desperately reaching out of turbulent currents. At a time when mainstream media was flooded with messages of courage and hope, a 90-year old manga artist was the only one with the strength to grab us by the head and force us to look at the destructive power of nature.

Growing up, the general consensus was that Yoko Ono was the woman who had interrupted one of the greatest musical movements. For many years, the press and the public published scathing commentary on Ono’s public and private decisions. She was criticized for influencing Lennon’s musical choices and her experimental artwork was derided by the greater public. While rumoured to have broken up the Beatles, Ono isn’t just a heart-breaker, and Lennon’s wife, but a renowned artist on her own, with her own band and groundbreaking art practice. Since her retrospective at the Whitney Museum in 1989, and a recent retrospective “ One Woman Show ” at MoMa in September 2015, public opinion of Ono has broadened into an appreciation of the contributions her avant-garde artwork has made towards feminism, human rights, and world peace.  Born in 1933 at her family’s ancestral estate in Tokyo and raised in Japan, Ono studied for a time at Sarah Lawrence College and got her start with the Fluxus conceptual art movement in New York City. Later, in 1969, Ono and Lennon started The Plastic Ono Band, collaborating on experimental music.

The entire land is dotted with site-specific artworks created by 160 artists from all over the world, making it the largest, most ambitious art festival in the world. And each piece is united by a single theme: humans are part of nature. Originally initiated in 2000, the festival recently wrapped up its 6th iteration.

In the same year Kihee Ichizawa was fatefully born. Perhaps a function of the times, Ichizawa grew up loving new things. He wore western clothing, started a band, opened a laundromat and, in 1905, bought an expensive sewing machine and made shirts and bags. That was the beginning of Ichizawa Hanpu , a Kyoto-based canvas bag maker that is celebrating its 110th birthday. And the party is coming to New York. Kihee’s son, Tsunejiro, took over the family business and shaped it, and the company’s bags, into what it is today. He focused on making tool bags for craftsmen. And he invested in an industrial sewing machine he purchased from Singer Company in the U.S. At the time it cost 400 yen: a little less than half of what it would cost to build a home. Thick canvas material could now be sewn, which resulted in a burst of popularity among  carpenters, plasterers, plumbers, pharmacists, liquor shop errand boys, and milkmen, who all needed sturdy bags to carry their tools and products. And the current shape and design of Ichizawa Hanpu’s bags are based on their original function. The 268 is based on the bags that milkmen used to carry milk bottles while the rectangular 93 was used to carry blocks of ice.  But those looking to purchase Ichizawa Hanpu’s bags are met with that discouraging statement we’ve all encountered when trying to purchase from Japan: “Our only shop in the world is located in Kyoto. We are sorry to inform that we do not take any orders from overseas.” But now, for the first time ever, the legendary bag maker will be traveling to New York to display and sell their bags. The event will take place this week from November 17 – 22, 2015 at the Kokage restaurant space in NY ( 39th between Park and Lexington ). Prices range from $65 – $170 depending on style and size.

The story — call it Tokyo’s property parable — has been told many times. But a new iteration is proving that maximized indoor living space isn’t the only key to good quality of life. Completed in April of 2015 and located in the Edogawa Ward of Tokyo, “Little House with a Big Terrace” doesn’t leave much for guesswork. It’s name, which borrows from Laura Ingalls , says it all. In response to a married couple’s request for a generous, outdoor yoga space, Takuro Yamamoto Architects designed a pair of large terraces that channel through the home. The bottom is used as a parking garage while the top is the couple’s large yoga terrace. Together, they’re almost equivalent to the adjacent 2-story home’s living space. It’s definitely a bold a rare plan that proves spaciousness can be achieved in ways other than maximizing living quarters. But that doesn’t mean that no attention was paid to the indoors. On the contrary, because the large yoga terrace reduced available living space, the architects had to work extra hard to put a number of space-saving idea to work. In a design that was perhaps inspired by the adventures of Indiana Jones, movable stairs reveal a passageway to a hidden storage room that’s ben inserted just above the ground floor. Large windows connect the terrace to the living room and the bedroom and act like a respiratory organ to let the house breath.

Fortunately, a society’s growth in close quarters has encouraged that infamous Japanese efficiency and creativity that we all know and love. How do the Japanese propose to solve this problem? Traditionally, many Japanese families have elected to live together, with multiple generations under one roof.

Huge glass windows guarantee you’ll always know what is going on in the street, from raucous autumn matsuri festivals to little capped schoolchildren clutching their bags while they tromp by on their morning jaunt to school. A sleek structure nestled among more conventionally built homes, YUUA’s latest project refreshes the feeling of the area with a modern feel. This architectural style, with its slim form, is reminiscent of tall wooden row houses in Chicago.

Like so many other buildings that were wrecked and created anew after the devastating earthquake, the Rebirth House has held onto elements of the past.  Although, at first, the exterior appears like any old storehouse, step inside and the interior will take your breathe away. The house features a traditional Japanese tiled roof, a delicate lacy mesh outer wall, and an impressive set of wooden doors. Inside, you will find a romantic brick-lined wine cellar, a large entertainment room with a wooden mezzanine floor, and you will feel a light wind that rustles through uniquely perforated window screens. Light will dance and flutter across the walls, projected through lacy screens, and you will be absolutely enchanted. At night, the whole building changes, into a gently glowing structure. As evening approaches, windows that were invisible in the day finally illuminate themselves. Rebuilt, this house highlights the myriad ways we can restore buildings that have been wrecked by natural disasters, and acts as a shining beacon for the future of restorative architecture. Matsui explains, “Inheriting from the old memory and the new behaviour, we hope [the Rebirth House will] become the house that can be loved from generation to generation.”  A beautifully lit cellar room, complete with a well seasoned selection of wines, supplies a more intimate setting for a dinner with friends or family. The brick-lined walls, remnants from the building’s reconstruction, keep the temperature even during all seasons. Residents can sip a hot cup of matcha, or Japanese green tea, while enjoying the light projected through these unique windowscreens.

It was designed by Yota Kakuda and is part of visual design studio WOW’s new product label BLUEVOX! The box that this table comes in reminds me of something a sniper would carry around.

An illustration he did of the movie Star Wars for an obscure Japanese science fiction magazine made its way to the hands of George Lucas, who liked it so much he commissioned Ohrai to create the universal poster for the movie’s sequel: The Empire Strikes Back. Lucas’s nod of approval solidified Ohrai’s reputation in the industry, and the commissions began flowing in. Ohrai created thousands of illustrations, usually in the genre of science fiction and , like the Godzilla series. Although not as popular, Ohrai also created numerous artworks for books and games. He was known as an incredibly meticulous worker who conducted a vast amount of research before going to work on a commissioned piece.

With sparse elegance, seamlessness, and an incredibly postmodern aesthetic all neatly tied together, of course. Meet Mamiya Shinichi Design Studio’s new office space, called Pillar Grove, in Nagoya City. The building’s exterior offers a dynamic break from the surrounding cityscape of tiled roofs. The atmosphere within offers inhabitants a meditative and expansive work space. Mamiya Shinichi skilfully contrasts pillars and slabs to create a refreshing environment that can shift according to staff’s needs. Pillar Grove is an inviting structure that easily holds potential to be a busy bookstore, bustling cafe, or quiet library. This is what happens when one innovative team of Japanese architects put their heads together to solve a design problem. Based out of Nagoya City, and boasting a Tokyo studio, these designers promote urban development through innovative interior and architectural design. Led by Director Mamiya Shinichi and Vice President Nagata Yoshitomo, twelve dedicated designers collaborate and strive to fashion new modes of living. This postmodern building is created entirely with wood and cement. Working with a simple concept: pillar + slab + facade, the architects manipulate form and light to mimic a bamboo grove, producing an ingenious way for people to produce and create inside a building as if they were embedded in nature. Raw wooden pillars shoot straight up at intervals within the room, echoing the aesthetic of being surrounded by towering trees in a Japanese bamboo grove.    The way the pillars and slabs are arranged determines the way the space is arranged within the building while the facade invites passersby to gaze within, (and vice versa). The building is not exceptionally tall by any means, but just imagine the view! At the end of a long work day, it must be pleasant for Mamiya Shinichi staff nestled inside Pillar Grove to peer out onto the sleepy city through those large windows.

But when they did that they also effectively scrapped the other 103 proposals, each created by professionals who spent a decent amount of time and resources perfecting their concept. Now, renowned designer and one of the foremost faces of Japanese design, Kenya Hara, is speaking out. And in doing so, he has released his proposal from the Hara Design Institute . “Removing the curtain from the design competition will help graphic design become more widely understood,” says Kenya Hara, explaining why he decided to publish his team’s proposal . “It will serve as a valuable resource in contemplating our future Olympics logo.” He notes that the Olympics symbol and “Tokyo 2020” have been obscured so as to avoid any copyright claims. Hara’s proposal is one that symbolizes “our planet making great strides,” “a beating heart” and the “summit.” The two planetary logos reference the sun, the moon and an arena where humans can transcend any bickering and come together for the great games. In today’s world of design planning it’s no longer sufficient to simply come up with a beautiful logo. Various applications and forms of communication must also be considered. And in that sense, Hara’s design team has created a remarkable proposal that adaptable to various needs. But in a surprising and rather confounding decision, the Olympics committee has opened up the new round of proposals to the public, allowing anyone over 18 to submit their idea. They’re accepting entries through December 7, 2015. The competition will undoubtedly bulge into a marathon with thousands of runners. We stand with designer Kenya Hara in hopes that this next race, whatever it turns out to be, is more transparent.

That would place Noritake Kinashi (or Nori-san, as he’s affectionately referred to on TV and by the general public), at the top of the artistic pyramid. As one part of the comedic duo Tunnels , Nori-san has had a successful television career and has been one of Japan’s most beloved comedic voices over the past 30 years. At a crowded gallery last Saturday night in Tribeca, Nori-san was dressed in a denim jacket, vest and hat with a plaid tie. He was grinning ear-to-ear, just like he does on television, looking like he was having the time of his life. Except he wasn’t making jokes. He was here to debut his solo exhibition of roughly 30 paintings. It’s no secret that, off-screen, Nori-san had been moonlighting as a painter. In fact, his art career was sparked by a comedy sketch he did in 1994 in which he played the part of a painter who was painting the Seine in France. And supported by his wife, actress Narumi Yasuda, who attended art school, he’s continued painting for the past 20 years. Sometimes abstract, often colorful, Nori-san has said that he likes creating work that makes people happy. Positive, uplifting imagery and text, as well as domesticity are recurring themes in the artist’s work. In 2014 Nori-san embarked on an ambitious, solo exhibition that would travel through Japan. It began in mid-2014 in Tokyo and has now been on display at 7 different museums across Japan. Now, that show has arrived in NYC at hpgrp gallery’s newly relocated space in Tribeca. His paintings are on display through November 11, 2015. Yes, the majority of people were there to see Nori-san the celebrity. But that didn’t seem to matter. Watching Nori-san interact with his fans, and talk about his artwork made one thing clear. For him, art was just another tool he used to achieve what he’s been doing with comedy: making people happy.

That, in essence, is the idea behind Japanese minimal retailer MUJI’s new project: MUJI HUT . Unveiled during this week’s Tokyo Design Week , the concept seeks to provide people with the very basics – a roof over their head – to do the things that city life sometimes doesn’t allow. Enjoy being alone, reading a book, listening to the sound of rain, or appreciating nature, proposes the minimalist lifestyle brand. Or just get lost in your own thoughts. To help you accomplish this, MUJI has teamed up with 3 notable designers to design 3 types of huts that can be easily and cheaply installed in the great outdoors. The first to hit the market will be Naoto Fukasawa’s Wooden Hut. In the pipeline are Jasper Morrison’s Cork Hut and Konstantin Grcic’s Aluminum Hut. All were on display from October 30 – November 3, 2015 at Tokyo’s Midtown Garden . The humble abodes will begin being selling in 2017 and are estimated to go for between 3 – 5 million yen (roughly $25,000 – $40,000). That wouldn’t include the cost of land, but at that price owning a vacation home sounds a lot more affordable! “When I hear the word hut, I’m attracted,” says designer Naoto Fukasawa. It’s not quite a villa but not as simple as a tent. With a small hut you can burrow into the wilderness whenever you want.”  “Whenever I think about going to the country for the weekend, I start imagining a small house with everything needed for a short stay,” says Jasper Morrison. “The dream usually collapses when I think of the complexity of building a new house, but with this project I realized there was a chance to design such a house as a product rather than a one-off.”  “The hut is just a space — it doesn’t have to be a fully functioning place for living,” says Grcic, whose the hut uses the same lightweight technology and fabrication system as delivery trucks. “There doesn’t have to be water or electricity. It is just a space for doing something.”","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["small spaces","Tokyo Designers Week"],"date":"November 6, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Portraits of Workers at the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo by Nico Therin","content":"On a recent trip to Tokyo, French photographer Nico Therin heard that the Tsukiji Fish Market was going to be relocated .

But what makes this photo series stand out from all the others are the faces he captures; the ordinary workers who move the iconic fish market and its 2,000 tons of fish that are traded every day. The market has been in existence since 1935, and with over 2,000 tons of fish trading hands on a daily basis, Tsukiji is the largest wholesale fish and seafood market in the world. It “handles more than 400 different types of seafood,” says Therin, “but is famous for its bluefin tuna auction.” And while all those statistics are impressive, Therin’s photos remind us of the ordinary faces that work there – the tired, the anxious, the ambitious – and are encouraging in the comfort they offer.

Designed by luminary Japanese architects SANAA, the sinuous building takes its name from the way water meanders through rolling terrain. The serpentine structure slithers down a hill, forming pond-like spaces on its way that function as a library, commons, arts center and gymnasium. “Our goal with the River is to make the architecture become part of the landscape,” says the not-for-profit foundation’s president. Comprised of Kazuyo Sejima and Ryuei Nishizawa, SANAA , in recent years, have gone from a highly respected yet obscure firm to globally recognized, Pritzker-winning all stars. The duo are known for their ethereal forms and high level of refinement that unnervingly capture a site’s social and physical context. The River Building is only their 3rd North American project, preceded by New York’s New Museum (2007) and Ohio’s Toledo Museum of Art (2006). “Grace Farms is a welcoming new place…for people to experience nature, encounter the arts, pursue justice, foster community, and explore faith,” says the foundation. And their 80 acres of hills, ponds and open space are open to the public, for free. But what exactly is this idyllic place that sounds too good to be true? Is it a church? Is it a cult? Critics may be skeptical. After all, Grace Farms is backed by Robert Prince, the CIO of Bridgewater . And the world’s biggest hedge fund itself has often been likened to a cult . But representatives will be quick to ensure you that “ it is not a church . It is a place to make good things happen, for people to come and make a difference.” No expense was spared in making this ambitious, 8-year, $83 million project a reality. Aside from SANAA, the team also had sustainability consultants, geothermal engineers and meadow consultants, which I didn’t even know was a thing. Their graphics were all done by design studio Pentagram . In sourcing materials for the structure, the laminated beams were so long that they had to be driven around the continent via New Mexico because the direct path from Canada to Connecticut was too curvy. The permanent art is equally impressive: works by Thomas Demand, Olafur Eliasson, Susan Philpsz and Teresita Fernandez. Grace Farms and it’s River Building elude categorization.

Currently on display is part 2/3 “between space and objects.” This is the one segment for which Nendo has designed a completely new series called “border table.” Responding to the difficulty of envisioning how the end consumer will use mass-produced furniture, Nendo created metal rod contours with small tabletops that wrap around – or in Nendo’s own words, parasitize – the corners and edges of walls. The end of October will signal the final phase of Nendo’s retrospective. For 3/3, the group will display new pieces like their “nest shelf” that was unveiled just a few weeks ago in London.

Where will she find the time with all her schoolwork? Not to worry. Saya is only as real as the pixels on your screen. Her soft cheeks, lush, black hair and hazel-brown eyes are all computer-generated imagery. Computer graphics have improved so drastically in recent years that it’s becoming difficult to tell the difference between real life and renderings.

It was called Heartland and it quickly became the local favorite watering hole in its Roppongi neighborhood. It flourished in the 90s and early 2000s and, in collaboration with major brewery Kirin, even developed their own Heartland Beer . The minimalistic emerald-green bottle bared almost no packaging; only a large tree and roots embossed in glass on the side of the bottle. The bar has since closed down but the beer lives on, and is offered at 100 restaurants around Japan. To commemorate the beer’s heritage a group of designers took on a painstakingly meticulous art project. Led by art director Arata Kubota , the team first began be creating a 3D replica of the famous tree logo originally designed by Ray Yoshimura. The tree was then sliced into 100 cross-sections, which, in turn, became the basis for 100 hand-drawn posters. Once the posters were complete they were framed and gifted to the 100 bars and restaurants across Japan that carry Heartland Beer, establishing an elegant connection that preserves the beer’s heritage. Appropriately titled “ Slice of Heartland ,” the art project took a year and a half to complete. But that doesn’t conclude the project. Once the frames were installed they were then photographed and stitched together to create an stunning stop-motion animation that shows the tree being assembled, 1 cross-section at a time. “We knew that drawing 100 different posters would be incredibly difficult and very inefficient,” says the Kubota in an interview . “But we felt that doing something no one had ever done, and challenging ourselves, was an embodiment of the craftsmanship that went into developing the Heartland brand.” Now that’s love and dedication. There’s a special website where you can see all the artwork and all the pubs where the poster is installed.

With a disproportionately large kitchen, STOCK and all its small details from the furniture to the orientation of offices were designed to bring people together, rather than having them work in isolation. With the proliferation of wework , shared offices are increasingly becoming our generations equivalent of the semi-exclusive restaurant clubs where Italians or Greeks would go to hang out in. In a smart piece titled Social (Media) Clubs , Kyle Chayka calls coworking spaces the new social network. “These are meant as spaces for work, unlike online social networks,” he says. “But their real product isn’t so much an office as it is interconnection, a sense of belonging.” And the same is true for Japan. Even in a country where social interaction with strangers is rare, coworking spaces are gaining popularity. There was The Scape(r) and Midoriso . And the latest to join is STOCK , which is attempting to offer coworking spaces to the food community.

And some breweries are turning to graphic designers to help rebrand and create a more appealing, more impactful product for those who find sake esoteric and inaccessible. Japanese sake packaging has always been characterized by fluid, stylized calligraphy that decorates the bottle’s label. But several breweries are experimenting with a more minimal look: one, they believe, will be more attractive to non-Japanese. “The name SOTO means ‘outside’ in Japanese,” says NY-based designer Joe Doucet , who was asked to help develop a new brand of sake suited for a western audience. “We wanted to invert the obvious interpretation of this by creating fully opaque 360º silkscreened label with a hole through both sides of the bottle which allows you to see the outside world thru the spirit.” Doucet created a highly eye-catching design that incorporates “the beautiful contradictions of Japan:” traditional vs. new; order vs. chaos. The result is an arresting product that stands out from other sake. (Although we’re not quite sure why the macrons were place over the name so that it reads SŌTŌ, instead of SOTO.) Kenji Ichishima, the 7th generation President of Ichishima Sake Brewery , also believes that a redesign has helped his brewery become more globally recognized. When speaking to an overseas client Ichishima recalls being told , “we don’t understand what’s written on the label.” Taking this feedback to heart, Ichishima was convinced that for foreigners who don’t understand Kanji, the calligraphic name was simply a symbol. And one that was hard to relate to. Ichishima decided to call up a friend: the New York-based Japanese designer Etsumi Imamura . Together they came up with a complete rebranding for their sake, which incorporates a graphic logo that replaced the company’s calligraphic name. Ichishima attributes the redesign to a significant growth in sales, not only in the West but in Asia, and even his home country of Japan. In response, the company is now producing their graphic logo on bottles for domestic consumption as well. The label is important, he adds, but for sake to become widely accepted it also has to taste good.","post_categories":["Food","Graphic Design"],"post_tags":["food","sake"],"date":"October 19, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Moon Parka: Outerwear Made From Synthetic Spider Silk","content":"Stronger than steel and more flexible than nylon, spider silk is said to be the toughest material on earth. For the past 11 years a Japanese company has been attempting to harness that strength to create a new type of material with unprecedented versatility. They’ve now unveiled their working prototype: the Moon Parka. The Moon Parka is the result of 11 years of technological innovation and investment, 10 design iterations and 656 gene synthesis designs. The main barrier, says Spiber , was synthetically producing spider silk that was economically feasible. To create their artificial spider silk fiber called Qmonos (from the Japanese word meaning ‘spider web’) the company used a fermentation process that involved microorganisms manufacturing recombinant proteins. This was not cheap. But Spiber has made remarkable progress and the cost is now 1/53,000 of what it was in 2008.

At least that’s what this young family decided to do. “The concern about this project was that 2/3 of the site was under consideration of the city road-building plan,” explains architect Tekenori Miura. The land was located at a small intersection in the Ota ward of Tokyo. And being the 3rd most populated ward in Tokyo, the city assembly had drawn up road expansion plans to relieve congestion. But instead of waiting around for the bureaucrats to make a decision, which conceivably could take forever, the family, who ran a local funeral business, decided to build anyway. “We want to keep running our company in this place, even if we have to give up two thirds of the building,” said the owners. “Even if we can only have a reception desk, we want to keep running our business here, as we have been doing.” So Miura and his firm Starpilots came up with a plan that would allow them to do exactly that. The aptly named “ House Cut ” was completed last year and is a 2-story home separated into 3 parts. Looking at it from the front, the left 2 volumes can be removed, leaving only a narrow office on the right.

Kobayashi’s mountain cottage is nestled deep in Ogawayama, a mountainous region of Nagano that’s often referred to as the Yosemite of Japan. It was built in 2008 by architect Shin Ohori , a good friend of Kobayashi’s. We wrote a short article about it in 2009, but with very little context or information. There are some good photos of the exterior over on the architect’s website , but now fashion label Beams has sent a reporter and photographer to see what the inside actually looks like.

Originally an aspiring painter, Sasamoto was coaxed into the male-dominated field by a friend who thought she had a good eye for imagery. And as fate would have it, Sasamoto found herself covering events like a 1940 German military visit to Japan, the Tripartite Pact sighing (between Japan, Germany and Italy) also in 1940 and the anti-Japan – U.S. Security Treaty demonstrations in 1960. Now, at 101, Sasamoto is still taking photographs with her Leica camera. What keeps her going? “Curiosity.” “Put positively, it’s curiosity,” says Sasamoto in an interview last month explaining what has kept her going all these years. “Even though I’m scared I still want to go; I don’t want to see it, but I do.” I want to capture this world that we live in and show it to people who aren’t aware.” In fact, ‘Curious Girl’ has become somewhat of a moniker for Sasamoto, and is occasionally used on the cover of her photobooks . But that doesn’t mean she’s only been taking photos for the last 75 years. In 1970, when several of her employers when under Sasamoto tried her hand at flower arrangements and tailoring clothes in order to make ends meet. But an exhibition of her photography in 1985 reignited her career. Sasamoto is currently working on a new book of floral photographs that reflects on the friends and acquaintances that she’s outlived. A retrospective of her work will be on display at O Art Museum in Tokyo from October 16 – November 11, 2015 and then again from November 14 – December 13, 2015 at the 21 Century Museum of Contemporary Art in Kanazawa.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["history","Photography"],"date":"October 7, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Awaglass: a mesmerizing hourglass that replaces sand with bubbles","content":"Remember watching those fleeting bubbles as a child and how sad it was when they popped?

The thinking behind the ampersand is that the city wants to encourage individuals and organizations to put their name in front of the logo, thereby increasing various associations people have with the city, and strengthening the brand of Japan’s capital ahead of the 2020 Olympics. Beginning October 16, 2015 anyone will be able to download hi-res versions of the logo and use them for free. The city of Tokyo reportedly paid ad agency Hakuhodo 130 million yen (about $1 mm) to design the logo. Kazufumi Nagai, the CEO of Hakuhodo Design and son of legendary graphic designer Kazumasa Nagai , took responsibility for crafting Tokyo’s new image. “I want to export our brand and establish Tokyo as the world’s greatest tourist destination,” said Masuzoe at the press conference . However, perhaps because of the previous scandal involving the 2020 Olympics logo being all so fresh in the public memory, and also perhaps because netizens have too much time on their hands, people were quick to point out that Tokyo’s new logo bared resemblance to the logo of Plug & See , a French eye-wear brand. Plug & See have already refuted the claim on Twitter, noting that it’s a different color, and that the ampersand is only part of their log. Another instance of similarity also popped up, this one from New Zealand. It was learned that law firm Jones & Co also used an almost identical logo.

But for a particular group of epicureans – and a wider group of tourists – the upcoming relocation of Tsukiji Outer Market represents one of the more drastic changes Tokyo has seen in recent years. And now we have glimpses of what the future holds: a name and rendering of the new fish market, set to open in 2016. After a public call-for-entries earlier this year, a committee selected “Tsukiji Uogashi” (築地魚河岸) as the official name of the new facility. While maintaining the original “Tsukiji,” the name adopts the word “Uogashi” which literally means fish river, but has traditionally been used to mean a fish market that’s located next to a body of water. However, a look at the initial renderings of the new 2-story building make us think that the architects aren’t really going for “traditional.” The shiny new facility looks more like a public library, or a school campus. It’s hard to see how any of Tsukiji’s old-world charm will be maintained in such sparkling, shiny headquarters. The transition will take place almost seamlessly with the old location closing in November of 2016 and the new Tsukiji Uogashi opening just several days later giving the 61 tenants time to move.

It’s telling that a foreign museum , in 2013, was the first to organize a large-scale Shunga Exhibition. But now Japan is playing catch-up. The Eisei Bunko Museum in Tokyo is organizing an exhibition of 122 pieces of Shunga, making it the largest exhibition of its kind in Japan. Running from September 19 – December 23, 2015 the Shunga Exhibition presents an overarching view of some of the most explicit and brilliants pictures of pleasure ever produced. Exquisitely created, the imagery was often intended to be tender as well as humorous. One of the highlights of the show will be the mameban (‘bean size’) which, as its name indicates, were small 9 cm by 13 cm pocket-sized porn that people often carried with them. Admission for the show is 1500 yen and you have to be 18 to enter. As a side note, it’s interesting to compare to the British Museum show, which simply stated “Parental guidance advised for visitors under 16.”   Japan’s first appearance of tentacle porn? The above image of a female diver being pleasured by a large and a small octopus is the one that understandably fascinates people the most. The text surrounding them describes her cries and exclamations of pleasure. A curator at the British Museum had this to say about the bizarre print: And also offers so context as to possible inspiration for the odd combination:  The oldest and most famous Japanese depiction of male-male sexual relations (nanshoku). Again, the curator explains: “This scroll is direct evidence for the practice of affective and sexual relations between mature monks and acolytes, which was quite widespread in Buddhist temples in Japan in the medieval period (sex between monks and women was more strictly forbidden).”","post_categories":["Art","Events"],"post_tags":["nsfw","tokyo guide","tokyo guide art shows","ukiyo-e"],"date":"September 21, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"In Training: A Documentation of the Slow Art of Bonsai Trees","content":"Voss is working with his favorite designer to create a beautiful photography book about bonsai and slowing down.

Over the past 20 years the unlikely location has emerged as one of Japan’s most prominent sites for cutting edge architecture, art and installations that all seamlessly merge with nature. And on the blog we’ve devoted several articles to the 12 islands and their 200+ works of art so we were excited to finally visit. We decided to share our itinerary with you because the multiple islands and ferries are certainly not easy to navigate. We spent a lot of time planning and thought that by sharing our notes with you it would make the islands more accessible. We took an early morning flight from Haneda that got us to Takamatsu airport by 9AM. From there it’s a 30 min bus ride to the ferry terminal. We bought our tickets for the ferry ride and 10 minutes later we were on the high seas! Well, not exactly. The Inland Sea is very calm and despite a typhoon passing nearby we barely felt the waves. 50 minutes later we were greeted by Yayoi Kusama’s red pumpkin at Naoshima’s Miyanoura Port. A shuttle at the port picked us up and took us to the Benesse House , where we were staying. A note about lodging: there are cheaper options but guests of Benesse House get to explore the museum during after-hours, which is quite special! It’s one of the reasons we decided to stay there. We then hopped in their shuttle to the other side of the island to explore the Honmura Area. While the typhoon left our plane and ferry unscathed, it did manage to shutter the Art House Projects. But even though the empty-Japanese-homes-turned-art-installations were closed, the town offers so much character that it was fun just walking around and exploring. We made our way back to the hotel for a 5PM tour of the collection. The tours are only offered in Japanese but highly recommended if you have a grasp of the language.  9:20 AM – Ferry departs from Miyanoura Port (Naoshinma) to Inujima; about a 1 hour ride. The next one isn’t until noon so we made sure we got on it! Inujima is a super-tiny island with a population of around 50 people. But what it lacks in size it makes up with some amazing art and installations. And because it’s so small time seems to slow down the moment you set foot on ‘dog island.’ Ironically, the island has more cats than dogs. It got its name from a large boulder that looks like a dog. We spent the morning strolling through an old copper refinery that had been turned into an environmentally sustainable museum. After that we walked into town and made our way through the art houses – a total of 5 – that had been converted into galleries by art director Yuko Hasegawa and architect Kazuyo Sejima. It was beautiful and meditative. One of the homes at the end thoughtfully comprised an installation of neon hammocks that you could lie down in and listen to the sounds of the island. 3:20 PM – The last ferry back to Miyanoura port departs and we were on it. Once we were back on Naoshima we headed to I ❤ Yu , a psychedelic public bath where we could rest our tired feet. (Note: towels and soap available for purchase but if you’re on a budget you will want to bring your own.) By then we were hungry so we grabed a bite at Café Konichiwa before making our way back to the hotel. The day ended with a guided night tour of Benesse House Park (beginning at 8PM) and a night-viewing of Kusama’s Yellow Pumpkin. That night we moved lodgings to the Benesse Oval House. It was an interesting experience as guests have access to the highest point of the hotel. It’s great for stargazing and the structure itself is gorgeous but the rooms are slightly more expensive and you have to take a cable car to get back and forth from the main hotel. The cable cars move at a snail’s pace (quite literally) and there’s only 1. Which means that if someone got in it right before, you could be waiting several minutes for it to return.         9:20 AM – We boarded the same ferry as yesterday but got off at Teshima (about a 30 min ride) before the ferry made its way on to Inujima. Compared to Inujima, Teshima is a much larger island and walking its mountainous terrain would take forever. Most people rent battery-powered bicycles, which are available as soon as you get off the ferry. The battery allows you to peddle up steep hills at ease (it still requires some degree of physical fitness) and then race down the steep slopes. This proved to be one of the highlights of the island. We pedaled our way to the Teshima Art Museum , one of the most enchanting places I’ve ever been in all my life. And yet on display is only a single artwork: droplets of water. Designed by artist Rei Naito and architect Ryue Nishizawa, the building consists of a concrete shell, devoid of pillars. Droplets of water magically seep out from the floor (watch where you step) and move along the concrete to join larger puddles, eventually trickling back into holes.  Two oval openings allow elements of the world – air, sounds, and light – to enter.If there’s a place where you could go to see our beautiful planet inhale and exhale, this may be it. Still dazed from the the Teshima Art Museum, we got back on our bikes and made our way to the seemingly deserted beach where, inside a small museum, French artist Christian Boltanski has installed “Les Archives du Cœur.” The installation permanently houses recordings of the heartbeats of people throughout the world and is intriguing albeit slightly creepy. After some stone-skipping in the calm waters of the inland sea our battery-powered bikes took us back up and around the mountainous island. As we headed back to the ferry terminal we stopped at Restaurant by the Sea . Sourcing only local ingredients, the terraced eatery makes you feel like you’re eating lunch while floating on the sea. Finally, we made a pit-stop at the Ichigoya ‘Strawberry House’ for an amazingly delicious strawberry shaved ice. 3:55 PM – Board the last shuttle back to Naoshima. That night we splurged on dinner at the hotel’s  Etoile de la mer (The Sea Star ). We had made reservations that morning and timed it so that we could attend the Benesse House Park’s museum tour at 8:00 PM. We had an evening flight back to Tokyo and decided to use our last day for all the leftovers on Naoshima that we hadn’t gone to yet. But that didn’t mean they were any less attractive. Once again (with trusty timetable in hand) we boarded our shuttle bus to the stunning Chichu Art Museum and got there right for 10:00 AM when it opened. Designed by Tadao Ando, the museum is built into a mountain and its facades are only viewable from the air. Highlights included a tiled room that you enter with slippers to view 3 large paintings by Claude Monet. And the James Turrell installation is nothing short of breathtaking. We also had time to squeeze in the Lee Ufan Museum and its profound collection of works. Back at our hotel, with our bags packed and our room tab settled, we spent our last moments wandering the gallery. Perhaps one of the most alluring and enchanting thing about the space, and all the artworks on these islands, is how connected they are to nature. In turn, your experience with them will differ depending on the day of the year and the angle of the sun. We lay on the large outdoor marble bed looking up, our bodies warmed by the emanating warmth from the suns beams the stone had been absorbing. Every once in a while a bird flew by or a dragonfly circled into the cubic structure we lay in.  Finally, it was time to go. As we got up to leave I noticed a small plaque in the corner with the title of the artwork. It was called “The Secret of the Sky.” ","post_categories":["Art","Go and See"],"post_tags":["setouchi","spoon tamago guide"],"date":"September 23, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"A Set of Nameless Paints Wants to Change the Way Kids Learn About Color","content":"The names we assign to colors are restrictive and only serve to impede our minds. The water that comes out of a faucet isn’t “blue.” Leaves on the trees can be “green” but they can be so much more. In Japan there’s even the absurd (skin color), a peachy color that’s so wrong I’m not even going to begin. But now a young designer duo wants to change the way kids learn about color. They’ve created a set of “ Nameless Paints ” whose colors are simply identified by just that – their color. “By not assigning names to the colors we want to expand the definition of what a color can be, and the various shades they can create by mixing them,” explains Yusuke Imai. Together with Ayami Moteki they form the design duo Ima Moteki. Instead of names, each tube in the 10-color paint set is identified by one or more circles of color. For tubes with more than one circle, the size of the circle indicates the proportion of paint that were mixed to create the resulting color. It’s a radical new way of getting kids to intuitively understand color and remove the preconceptions that names like “green” and “blue” create. The set of “ Nameless Paints ” were originally part of the 2012 Kokuyo Design Awards , one of the most interesting design awards in Japan that’s helped commercialize simple yet groundbreaking products like the kadokeshi eraser or the infinite canvas roll table .

Since then the various districts within the city have evolved both culturally and typographically. Navigating the city can be a challange and town block indicator plates (as seen above) were Japan’s answer to street names. But these primary identifiers of location lacked continuity in visual appearance and format. And while, admittedly, they do add local flavor to various neighborhoods, graphic designer Yoshiaki Irobe felt that Tokyo needed a signage system that would strengthen the city’s identity and also serve as a silent guide for the 20 million tourists the government is targeting by 2020. Together with Type Project , Irobe developed “ Tokyo CityFont ,” a typeface that could be used not only on block indicator plates but throughout diverse platforms of information: everything from maps and buses to street signs and banners. “The development of a city font and the application of it in urban architecture and spaces, and signage, catalogs, business cards and all manner of other media give consistency to the overall image of the city,” says the designer. “Not only does this increase convenience for local residents, it contributes to making deeper impressions on visitors and to improving the long-term value of the city.” Irobe and his team underwent various phases and testing which eventually led to a public sign trial experiment in Ginza in 2012. In collaboration with the city, the team created marks, logos, leaflets and signage and installed them throughout Ginza. A lot of thought also went into the typeface itself and what “Tokyoness” means. “We sought a concept that would link Tokyo and Edo with ‘spiritedness and stylishness’ and we set our sights on a typeface that would be endowed with the continuity of history and the distinctiveness of the locality.” Yoshiaki Irobe will be presenting his Tokyo CityFont project as part of his solo exhibition that is currently on view at Ginza Graphic Gallery (ggg) through September 28, 2015.

Once the ink has dried the artist goes in with acrylic, gouache and mineral pigments to add intricate details that reveal animals hidden or camouflaged by the ink. Some require several minutes to spot while others are more apparent. After spending the majority of her life growing up between the U.S. and Japan and travelling extensively in-betweens (Saito counts more than 25 countries) the 30-year old artist has recently returned to Japan where she is staging her 2nd solo exhibition since being back. Opening tomorrow, September 15, 2015, at Wada Garou in Tokyo, Saito will present “ Celestial Crossing ,” a series of paintings and sculptures. At the forefront of the show are her “Animals in Ink” series. Perhaps it’s because of her fast-paced upbringing that eventually led Saito to work with sumi ink, a media that’s been around since the 7th century and one that reminds her of the slow childhood days of calligraphy classes at school. Saito recalls the words of her teacher: “Really pay attention to how you influence the ink through subtle decisions. It’s so sensitive to the body and environment.” Saito’s work often possess the qualities of a Rorschach Test. You see something and identify it, only to then reassess and understand that it was purely abstract. Herein lies the essence of Saito’s work: an in-between realm that exists within the abstract and the super-real. The ultimate goal of sumi ink, Saito reminds us, was “not simply to reproduce the appearance of the subject, but to capture its soul.” Miki Saito’s paintings will be on view at Wada Garou in Tokyo through October 3, 2015. You can follow Saito on Instagram for glimpses into her creative process!

Conservationism and a reverence for the natural world are recurring themes in his movies like Nausicaa, Totoro and Princess Mononoke. Now Miyazaki has announced plans to pass on his love for nature to children in the form of a tangible nature park. The project is being called “The Forest Where the Wind Returns.” Miyazaki is funding the park with 300 million yen (roughly $2.5 mm USD) of his own money. To put things in perspective, the Ghibli Museum , Miyazaki’s first and highly successful attempt at a real-life theme park, cost 5 billion yen (roughly $40 mm USD). So anyone expecting something like the hypothetical Ghibli Land should calm down. But with that said, the park sounds lovely. It will be built on roughly 10,000 square meters of land in the Zendo Forest Park on Kume Island (in Okinawa). There will be no man-made play equipment and instead the park will utilize the trees, boulders and land to create a park where children and their five senses can interact with nature. According to the town of Kume’s local newspaper (PDF), the facility will include a 2-story building with a library and sleeping quarters that can accommodate 30 children from the local town but also from Fukushima. Miyazaki will donate the structure and park to the town of Kume and is sourcing all the talent and materials locally in order to ensure that it is sustained for many years to come. Miyazaki has teamed up with local design firm Kume Creation , who have release an initial rendering of what the park will look like. Construction is slated to begin shortly and the team is aiming to open the park in 2 years.","post_categories":["Architecture","Art"],"post_tags":["Ghibli","island life","okinawa"],"date":"September 15, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"The Work of Graphic Designer Yoshiaki Irobe","content":"The true power of design, says Yoshiaki Irobe , is its wallpaper-like quality of small continuities that line up together to create an uninterrupted wall.

A bright yellow handbook with a cute rhino on the cover. He’s wearing a helmet, carrying a backpack and has a pensive, cautious look on his face. Open the cover and you’ll find the following statement: “It is predicted that there is a 70 percent possibility of an earthquake directly hitting Tokyo within the next 30 years. Are you prepared? This is Tokyo Bousai , the Tokyo Metropolitan Government’s disaster preparedness guide. Just last week Lloyd’s of London released their City Risk Index and named Tokyo as the 2nd riskiest city in the world. The study cited an elevated chance of natural disaster (earthquake, flood and typhoon) but also named nuclear accidents as a high risk, adding that Japan could lose 39 trillion yen ($324 billion) of its GDP to potential disasters over the next decade. And so the government of Tokyo has a clear message for its residents: be prepared. Unlike typical material and publications distributed by bureaucracies, Tokyo Bosai is beautifully designed. It’s the result of a collaborative effort between design firm Nosigner , ad agency Dentsu and the Tokyo Government Disaster Prevention Department . The Guide’s bright color makes it stand out and a simple layout with easy to recognize illustrations not only makes it comprehensible, but actually enjoyable to read. The intuitive guide is separated into 5 chapters that cover earthquake simulation, preparedness and survival tips, the latter which includes many ideas that were aggregated by Nosigner after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami and released under the Olive project . I’m a sucker for attention to detail and I love how the Rhino mascot turns into an animated flipbook in the corner of the pages. Although a hard copy is being distributed to all Tokyo homes – at 7.5 million copies it’s the largest effort of its kind to date – the guide in its entirety can be downloaded online . And yes, it’s available in English to. However, it’s better to keep a hard copy as electricity will likely be out during any type of disaster. Be safe Tokyoites!

But now design firm Nendo has created a seemingly magical nesting bookshelf that appears to emerge outward from another bookshelf. It’s being presented at the 2015 London Design Festival opening this weekend. The trick to Nendo’s “ Nest Shelf ” is an ultra-thin horizontal section (just 4.8 mm) that slides inside the outer shelving. This extreme feat of engineering was made possible by a 3.7 mm carbon fiber that sandwiches a honeycomb material made from a synthetic fiber called aramid. When expanded to its fullest the shelf doubles in size. “Extending the shelf halfway produces a grid shelf-style layout with rows of square shelves,” notes Nendo, which allows the user to customize the shelf to fit the space.

The Kiyono eatery has been serving traditional Japanese food and drink to locals of Kodaira, Tokyo for almost 40 years. But when they decided to renovate, their location proved problematic. The acute triangular plot of land jutted outward to form a most irregular shape. Running northward parallel to the home are train tracks that not only create constant noise but rumblings as well. Architect Kunihiko Nakama was tasked with constructing a 3-story building that functioned as a shop for the eatery but also 2 residences for the family. His bold proposal was to create a structure that fully maximizes the plot of land while also forming walls thick enough to stave off the noise from the trains.

So flat land obviously comes at a premium. But one architect has now gone where others have tend to shy away: into the sloping side of a mountain. Completed earlier this year, Greendo is an undulating 7-unit residential building that’s been carefully inserted into the side of mountain in a town in Takamatsu City, Japan. The sloping site of Greendo (green + do, which is Japanese for earth) had been left untouched for years until local architect Keita Nagata came around. Instead of flattening the land and building upward, Nagata proposed a radical new design in which each unit, instead of being stacked on each other, were delicately pushed into the side of the slope. Not only did the idea relieve stress that would have been place on the land and structure, it yielded an organic structure that seamlessly integrates itself into the landscape. But if this was going to be a home built into the side of a mountain, Nagata wanted to take it a step further. He wanted to create a fully passive home that lived and breathed with the land. Ventilation tubes that connect to the homes travel underground and in the summer the earth naturally cools the air. Conversely, in the winter the air is warmed. Solar panels are also mounted on the roofs, which function as the neighbor’s yard as well. Humidity was a big concern so several layers of anti-humidity insulation were incorporated into the walls. The units range from 66,000 yen (about $530) to 135,000 (about $1000) per month but it appears that all units are already rented or in contract.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["architecture-residential","Green Design"],"date":"July 28, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Makoto Azuma Created a 13-ft Flower Bouquet Floating in the Middle of the Ocean","content":"There are some places where flowers just weren’t meant to grow.

He would create wood block sculptures and toys for his daughter, which eventually led to a fascination with M.C. Escher-like illusionistic art. Fukuda himself was born into a family involved in the manufacturing of toys, which may have somehow contributed to underlying interest in 3D objects.

Shukan Anpo generally consisted of several longform essays, reports on other political movements in the U.S. and around the world, photo-journalistic reports on incidents around Japan and political cartoons.

The Japanese influential graphic designer – he passed away in 2009 – used minimal graphics to voice antiwar and environmental advocacy messages. Perhaps the most well-known, or the one that stands out most to me, is “Victory 1945,” showing a projectile artillery shell heading straight for the opening of the cannon barrel. It was this type of visually humorous yet elusive style that made Fukuda’s posters so powerful. Although Fukuda had a few commercial clients like UCC Ueshima Coffee, the majority of his work was devoted to social and cultural concerns. He “was known for acerbic antiwar and environmental advocacy posters,” wrote design writer Steven Heller, “that distilled complex concepts into compelling images of logo-simplicity.” He did a lot of work for Amnesty International, one of the more memorable a poster showing a drawing of a clenched fist interwoven with barbed wire. In times like this, when Japan prepares to take a step towards a dark path, the presence, or lack thereof, of people like Shigeo Fukuda becomes especially pronounced.  An example of his cultural work is shown above. The official poster for the 1970 World’s Fair in Osaka. Fukuda did, of course, have a few commercial clients. One of them was UCC Ueshima Coffee, for which he designed these playful, repetitive ads. He once told Idea Magazine that “I believe that in design, 30 percent dignity, 20 percent beauty and 50 percent absurdity are necessary.”","post_categories":["Graphic Design"],"post_tags":["political","war"],"date":"July 15, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Japanese Manhole Cover Art Prints by David Robert","content":"It’s no secret that Japanese manhole covers are some of the most intricate and colorful in the world.

When it comes to treehouses, his name is known across Japan and overseas. So when he was approached by the Risonare resort in Atami to create a treehouse for them, Kobayashi had his reservations. After all, he had plenty of other offers. But “the quality of the treehouse is fully dependent on the tree itself,” says Kobayashi modestly. “Encountering a good tree is everything.” That’s why, when he visited the potential site and met the towering 300-year old camphor tree, it immediately fueled his imagination and he accepted. Completed in March of 2014, Kusukusu (it borrows its name from , Japanese for camphor tree) is a marvelous feat of architecture, engineering and technology. Working with Hiroshi Nakamura of NAP Architects, the team came in and 3D-scanned hundreds of points on the tree. Based on that 3D data they then created a steel trellis that threaded through the tree, interlocking perfectly and acting as an architecturally weight-bearing yet visually stunning support system. What’s amazing is that the treehouse in its entirety, never touches the tree. It’s completely self-standing so as to not harm the tree. Leading up to the treehouse is a 120-ft long pathway of lush greenery. As visitors approach the structure there is a large base, followed by a 2nd mezzanine. There is a coffee stand, a picnic area and athletic activities like zip lines where kids can play. It’s worth noting though that the treehouse is only open to guests of the Risonare Atami resort. Resting perfectly like a birds nest, the treehouse is Kobayashi’s biggest undertaking to-date and is also the largest treehouse in all of Japan.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["Green Design","Hiroshi Nakamura"],"date":"July 23, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Revealed: The Tokyo 2020 Olympics Emblem Designed by Kenjiro Sano","content":"In exactly 5 years – on July 24, 2020 – the Tokyo Olympics will open. So today the committee unveiled the official Tokyo 2020 emblems for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. We were happy to see that the emblems were designed by Kenjiro Sano , a graphic designer who we’ve championed on the blog for quite some time. Sano was chosen from an open call for submissions in which a total of 104 designers (4 of which were from overseas) submitted proposals. The emblems are characterized by modern, abstract representations of the letter T. The symbolic letter stands for Team – “When the world comes together for Tokyo 2020, we will experience the joy of uniting as one team.” It also stands for Tomorrow – “for a better world and a brighter future.” And of course it also is the first letter of the host city: Tokyo. We love the shapes and colors and our overall first impressions is pretty great. It’s incredibly difficult to design for the future but this artwork seems pretty timeless. The selection committee was headed by graphic designer Kazumasa Nagai , who noted that the previous Tokyo Olympics in 1964 were represented by a simple yet powerful emblem designed by Yusaku Kamekura (left image). A large round sun at the top dominated the composition. Beneath it were the five-ringed symbol of the Olympic Games with simply “TOKYO 1964” below it. However, its sculptural quality was impactful and meaningful and Nagai believes that Sano’s 2020 design will have the same effect on Japan and the rest of the world.

Over the weekend American designer Thom Browne hosted his Spring 2016 menswear show at a warehouse in the outskirts of Paris. But, clearly, Japan was on everyone’s minds. It’s no secret that Japan holds a very special place in the heart of Thom Browne. In 2001 Browne left Club Monaco to launch his own label. But by 2010, when Browne was still working out of a tiny, appointment-only shop, his sales in Japan were rivaling his biggest success story – Bergdorf Goodman. This, in part, was due to a deal in 2009 in which Japanese apparel company Cross Company acquired a majority stake in his business. Then in 2013 Browne chose Tokyo for his first overseas flagship store . (I actually had the pleasure of meeting him last year when he was in Tokyo for the 1-year anniversary of his shop.) Now, before you dismiss Browne’s collection as simply something “I would never wear,” keep in mind that fashion shows like this aren’t intended to present everyday clothing. Of course we’re not going to paint our face white and go to work tomorrow wearing intricate, Japan-inspired motifs on kimono suits. Fashion shows are meant to be abstract and experimental. They’re meant to push the boundaries of what fashion can and can’t do.

City Halls are stuffy places, with suits and paperwork. It’s where we go to change our address, submit birth certificates and to pay our taxes. The only similarity – if I was to make one – between City Halls and amusement parks would be the lines. But if the Aore City Hall in Nagaoka were an amusement park it would be the 3rd most popular in all of Japan. Completed in 2012, Aore City Hall was designed to be an architectural specimen that would stimulate and reinvigorate the local economy. And that’s exactly what it has accomplished . In a City with a population of 280K people, Aore, as it was called, attracts roughly 1.2 million people per year. That’s about how many people the popular Yomiuri Land amusement park gets. Aore City Hall was designed by acclaimed architect Kengo Kuma who envisioned the structure as a place where people would want to congregate. In other words, the opposite of what City Halls typically do. To pull this off Kuma first focused on the entrance, which had to be inviting. Taking inspiration from traditional Japanese homes, Kuma created a large that functions as a covered yard and is used for daily entry points. This way people could approach the building without feeling intimidated. Another major change that was proposed and incorporated into the building was placing the Chamber on the ground floor. Typically, the Chambers where politicians gather for meetings were thought to be intimidating and therefore were always built on the top floor of the city hall. But by placing it on the ground level and allowing citizens to view the proceedings through 2 large windows the architecture creates an affinity between local politics and the citizens. The suspended wood panels on the ceiling, all sourced-locally, also help create a more friendly, non-stuffy environment. The entire building, in fact, is decorated with similar wood paneling that creates a warm, welcoming feel. It’s become a gathering spot for locals and visitors, even if there are no roller coasters.

You would go to a sushi shop. And if you wanted Italian food you wouldn’t ask your sushi chef to boil pasta. The same thinking, says Taku Hibino, should hold true for architecture. Hibino is one chief architects at Hibinosekkei+Youji no Shiro , an architecture firm and brand in Japan specializing in the design and construction of learning facilities for early education. The Obama Kodomoen (no relationship to the president of the U.S.) is like an interactive museum for kids. Located in Nagasaki, the structure was designed to incorporate the nearby ocean. A hallway that encircles the whole facility makes sure the kids relieve all their energy before they sit down in the art studio (or stand next to the numerous chalkboard walls) to nurture their creative side. The cafeteria boasts spectacular views of the water. The firm dates back 43 years when Japan was in the midst of radical change and development. In the 1970s Japan was miraculously sustaining its economic development, albeit at a slower rate, even sustaining higher petroleum prices despite being a nation with few natural resources. After its 1 baby boom in the late 1940s, Japan experienced their 2 baby boom in the early 1970s, which spurred massive demand for childcare facilities. Between 1972 and 2005 the firm built over 50 educational facilities.  that blow through Kamisu City in Ibaraki prefecture are great for its many wind turbines, it meant that the nursery school had to be designed to protect kids from strong gusts. The architects proposed a courtyard-type structure with an open layout and open cafeteria that actually helped kids conquer some of their veggies that they wouldn’t touch at home. Special emphasis was placed on the bathrooms too in order to rid preconceived notions that bathrooms are dark and scary places. “We have a lot of experience,” says Hibino, “but each time we realize there’s something we could have done better.” Japan is now facing a critical decline in population and startlingly low birthrates. One would expect Hibino’s business to be suffering. But instead, it’s booming. In the last 10 years, since the Youji no Shiro brand has been established, the team has completed over 300 early education facilities. The strong demand for the HIBINOSEKKEI+Youji no Shiro is perhaps due to the amount of empirical evidence that points to overwhelming benefits for early education. But it’s also the current environment, explains Hibino. Early education requires vision and leadership. And when educators in Japan get serious, they know who to call.  is experiencing a sharp decline in population and birthrate. But instead of ignoring the issue the architects proposed to face the issue head on.

It’s no doubt that outdoor play, whatever the weather, is a necessity of childhood. So if there’s any place where kids should be allowed to be kids, without being subject to the cringes and shouts of adults who are overly concerned about wet shoes, socks and pants (don’t even mention the mud), that place is preschool. Usually when it rain, kids aren’t allowed to play outside until the ground is dry. But the new Dai-ichi Yochien in Kumamoto City is designed to make sure the puddles stay exactly where they are. The courtyard of the school is designed to accumulate rain water so that after a heavy downpour there is a gigantic, pool-like puddle just waiting for the kids to come out and play, explains Taku Hibino. The lead architect at Hibino Sekkei designed the courtyard so that on dry days it can function as a badminton or softball court and in the winter it can even be converted to an ice skating rink. Rain or shine, these kids will always be able to go outside. Hibino Sekkei, and their Youji no Shiro brand, specialize in designing early education facilities. You can read more about them here . The school itself was designed with an open floorplan in order to foster a curriculum that’s both flexible and unconstrained. Furniture is used as partitions and teachers are encouraged to mix up different classes. Students are asked to purchase their own desk and chair, which they keep and eventually take home after graduating. This keeps a continual flow of new furniture into the school, which helps in maintaining a fresh and clean aesthetic.","post_categories":["Uncategorized"],"post_tags":["architecture-educational","Kids"],"date":"June 23, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Mikiya Kobayashi Gives Kutani Porcelain a Modern Twist","content":"Kutani porcelain dates back to the mid-1600s and is one of the backbones of Japanese pottery.

I had no idea what that meant, but it sounded cool, so I read on. The project, dubbed “ Fairy Lights in Femtoseconds ” is being officially presented at SIGRAPH 2015 this august. The team succeeded in creating 3D aerial graphics that would respond and react to the human touch. A Femtosecond is a measure of time that’s equivalent to one quadrillionth of a second. How fast is that? One way of thinking about it is, one femtosecond is to one second as one second is to about 32 million years, explains MIT , who pioneered the technology. Practically, Femtosecond lasers are used in micromachining and Lasik eye surgery. Using femtosecond lasers that are safe for human contact the researchers created interactive holograms that can be programmed to respond and change form in reaction to contact. The holograms proposed here are small – about 1cm cubed – but the researchers say the size is scalable, which could make things interesting perhaps in the medical imaging industry but also in visual art. The project was spearheaded by researchers at several Japanese universities and include Yoichi Ochiai, Kota Kumagai, Takayuki Hoshi, Jun Rekimoto, Satoshi Hasegawa, and Yoshio Hayasaki.

And at a certain time in the afternoon sunlight passes through the prism roof and the teahouse is decorated with rainbows or, in Yoshioka’s words, “a flower of light.” Being a sought-after designer, Tokujin Yoshioka has traveled the world for the past several years and at each site he has “been considering where can be the right place for the venue of Kou-An.” In choosing his current site, a temple rather than a garden, Yoshioka placed a lot of weight on the site’s historical significance and mysticism. In 794 a Japanese emperor visited the site and was so inspired that it convinced him that Kyoto would be the right place for the country’s capital. In a sense, it can be argued that this site is where Kyoto, and in turn, various Japanese traditions, originated. “I have determined to transmit the concept of this project to the world, starting out from such a symbolic and historical city in Japan,” says Yoshioka.

Sometimes also called yaki-sugi-ita, the process involves charring the wood to a charcoal-like state. This not only makes it less flammable but also more durable against the elements of nature. In other words, burning it to make it stronger. Taking inspiration from the method commonly employed in her hometown of Okayama, artist Miya Ando has created a tea house-inspired installation whose exterior is made entirely from the charred timber.  The free-standing room titled “Emptiness The Sky” (Shou Sugi Ban) is clad on the outside walls with the charred timber. On the inside are Ando’s signature reflective metal canvases, which create a reflective, immersive environment. “The 84x 84x 84 inch structure is inspired by traditional Japanese tea rooms (Chashitsu),” says Ando, “and is a space informed by memory and quietude.” Miya Ando’s large-scale installation is part of the 56th Venice Biennale’s “Frontiers Reimagined” Exhibiton at Museo di Palazzo Grimani .

So to overcome these differences TOTO, the largest toilet manufacturer in Japan (and the world!) decided to place a toilet gallery in the first place foreigners come to when they visit Japan: the airport. “For Americans here in the US, the biggest issues are personal experience with these products and a major reluctance to discuss bathroom issues or change ingrained habits,” says Steve Scheer the President of a toilet startup trying to crack open this market. “You wouldn’t imagine how many people giggle nervously or say ‘gross’ when we try to educate them about the advantages of the bidet seat, yet these are the same people that are still using paper – a much inferior way to cleanse oneself.” But TOTO is trying to change this perception by getting visitors to experience their toilets first hand at the airport.

As visitors approach, the flowers float above their head, creating a small dome. It’s like the Rain Room, but with vegetation. TeamLab’s exhibition was originally scheduled to close on March 1 but it was extended through May 10, 2015 due to popular demand. The Floating Flower Garden is their newest work – sort of like an encore exhibition – that the designers added to the full lineup. “In this interactive floating flower garden viewers are immersed in flowers, and become completely one with the garden itself,” says TeamLab , describing the installation. According to the designers the piece was inspired by a Zen koan from Nanquan Puyuan (南泉和尚, 748 – 835), the founder of a famous monastery. As legend has it, Nanquan spent 30 years in a mountain retreat without ever leaving. At the governor’s request, Nanquan finally comes down to teach the people on the plain: According to the explanation , “Nanquan seems to be pointing out that the unenlightened cannot fully perceive the flower as it really is, cannot experience it directly and purely. Instead it is approached as an object apart from the viewer, the subject. It is not seen as an extension of his or her own reality.

At night he would come home and work on his passion: a large, incredibly detailed maze. After spending 7 years the creation was finally completed in 1983, at which point it was rolled up and stashed away in an attic where it was forgotten about. But when his daughter unearthed it two years ago and posted it to twitter, Mr. Nomura’s creation was pulled out into the spotlight.   When his daughter asked him if he would create a 2nd maze his answer was quick and succinct. “No,” he responded. “I’ve had enough of mazes.” But late last year she posted this to twitter: “After 32 years Papa has begun drawing a maze again. He says he wants to make it easier to solve, and more beautiful. #ashisdaughterimlookingforwardtoitscompletion #isthisgoingtotakeanother7years” Working in a similar fashion – drawing small portions each day – it took Mr. Nomura about 2 months to complete his new maze. And in our humble opinion, we think it’s actually just as beautiful, if not more. It’s not quite as dense and the crisper lines make it easier to perceive the interesting patterns that the maze forms.

But after WWII the company leveraged its expertise in metallurgy to branch into motorcycles as well, creating a most diverse product range. Today, the company not only makes musical instruments, bikes and motorcycles, but sporting goods and robots as well.  But motorcycles and musical instruments remains their bread and butter and Yamaha’s origins are still reflected today in their logo—a trio of interlocking tuning forks. In order to stimulate innovation within the diverse company, Yamaha recently embarked upon a design initiative called AH A MAY . The naming was derived from Yamaha spelled backwards. But the project itself was one of cross-dissemination, rather than reversal. They asked their motorcycle designers to create musical instruments. Meanwhile, their musical instrument designers were tasked with coming up with a motorcycle and bicycle. Led by Kazuki Kashiwase at Yamaha’s design department, a team of musical instrument designers came up with root , a prototype for a motorcycle. Taking their cue from the focus required from musicians, the designers removed all the dials from the rider’s view “to enable him or her to be a part of the passing scenery.” They then created a wristwatch that would sync with the motorcycle and display metrics like speed and rotations. The graceful design of the seat was “inspired by a horse motif that aims to give a sense of unity among people, nature, and the vehicle.”   A group of motorcycle designers at Yamaha created this wild marimba and named it after the Japanese god of wind, Fujin (風神). Inspired by the image of a 2-seater motorcycle, the designers came up with a layout for two performers that  “allows them to add and multiply their energy.” Whereas traditional musicians move side to side along a horizontal marimba to reach the different wooden bars, Fujin is circular and allows the players to remain seated. A handle lets the players spin the marimba around them creating a “thrill of unexpected swings and gaps.” In addition to the motorcycle and marimba there was also a bicycle and drum set that was created for the initiative. All the pieces were on display this month in France at the Biennale Internationale Design Saint-Etienne 2015 from March 12 through 22.

Ninety percent of falls are the result of people, in a drunken stupor, getting up from a bench they were sitting on and walking straight off the platform. The results are surprising because conventional reasoning and logic assumed that drunks would wander closer and closer to the ledge and eventually fall off. The data, however, showed the opposite. Only ten percent of drunks gradually drifted towards the ledge, while an outstanding majority briskly walked off the ledge as if they knew exactly where they were going. After reviewing the results, JR West is now considering a sweeping reorientation of all platform benches. They have already rolled out a few testing sites to see if a drop on falls can be measured. Incidents involving people falling off the platform have been on the rise in recent years, which is what prompted the study. According to the MILT , in 2013 there were 221 incidents, a figure that has doubled over the last 10 years. And of that, alchohol-related incidents rose 4-fold. The 2-year study, which was conducted in the Osaka, Kobe and Kyoto regions, utilized footage captured from platform security cameras. Data scientists analyzed 136 different incidents captured on camera. “The results were unexpected,” admitted Naoyoshi Tsujino, who helped conduct the study. “We observed a large majority falling [off the platform] within seconds of getting up.” Kensuke Kawakami, a train station planner said “We realized that randomly reminding passengers wasn’t enough and that we needed to come up with a different plan.”*","post_categories":["Industrial Design"],"post_tags":["trains"],"date":"March 29, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Mesmerizing Molten Glass Paintings by Etsuko Ichikawa","content":"Etsuko Ichikawa is a Tokyo-born, Seattle-based artist who creates mesmerizing abstract “paintings” through the art of pyrography.

However, after Spain’s economic downturn he began polishing shoes, and does so to this day, at the Café Central de Málaga in Spain. Javier, lovingly known by the locals as a “quirky diabetic,” has always been tech-savvy. In early 2007, when twitter was just under a year old, Javier joined the fledgling social network under the handle @xabel and was quick to develop the foresight as to what it could become. Seeing that strategically important geographic handles lay unclaimed and vulnerable, Javier tasked himself with grabbing what he could, protecting them, and safely delivering them to their rightful owners when the time came. These included @madrid, @malaga, @rome, @canada, @riodejaneiro, @NY and @japan. Not only was Javier an early adopter but he was also a proponent of selflessness. Much like website domain names, an underground market, while officially prohibited , does exist for the buying and selling of valuable twitter handles. But Javier wasn’t motivated by financial gain. He merely believed that “people everywhere need to be represented by a suitable brand.” He does admit to receiving small gifts for his donations though. The mayor of Rome sent him a book while the Principality of Asturias sent him an assortment of handicrafts and food. By 2014 Javier’s 7-year quest was coming to an end. He had successfully donated @Madrid, @Canada and @Rome. But @japan was proving to be problematic. A heavy bureaucracy and language barriers weren’t helping either. In 2012 Javiar managed to get in touch with Noriyuki Shikata, Director of Communications at the Japanese Embassy in the U.K. He was about to hand over the password when “there was a change of government in Japan and everything stopped.” But Javier remained patient. “There were some attempts to pose as institutions in order to get an account, but I was pretty cautious,” he told the Washington Post. After all, the @NY account had been stolen from him a while back. Finally, on March 10, 2015, the Japanese Government officially took over the @japan account and began tweeting. They plan to use it as a tool for English information on Japan. So what happens for Javier, now that his journey has ended? He’ll continue to shine shoes until he spots the next up and coming social network, at which time he’ll put down his brush and put on his cape.","post_categories":["Interactive/ Technology"],"post_tags":["history","Twitter"],"date":"March 19, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Sculptures of Decomposing Body Parts by Yuichi Ikehata","content":"Japanese photographer Yuichi Ikehata creates realistic sculptures of human body parts using clay, wire and paper.

The retrospective, taking place at the Creation Gallery G8 in Ginza, will feature a selection of Sano’s past work, showcasing the depth and reach that entitles him to a name like Mr. Design.

The plastic-like material is first extruded into a thin film. But when it’s cut into gigantic shapes that cover stadiums there’s a lot of excess material that gets thrown out. And as it turns out, explains Japanese design firm k2m , the material is permeable enough that it can be used for smaller things as well. Seeing an opportunity in the waste created during the process of creating stadium roofing, k2m, a design frim established by two architects and a management consultant, founded katamaku ( means fragment and refers to the roofing membrane). By incorporating an elegant origami-style production, the architects have designed a series of carrying cases – business card holders, pencil cases, document folders – using a single sheet of folded roofing material. And while these types of everyday accessories aren’t subjected to the harsh conditions of stadium roofing, ” ‘katamaku’ will make people realize the beauty in materials that are not usually seen up close,” says the founders.

We dodged puddles of ice as we made our way to Ai Campbell’s studio, where she creates her intricate paintings that are inspired by animal bones, organisms and landscapes. Dark, Rorschach test-like splotches lined the wall as we entered her studio, accessed by a stairway to the 2nd floor. Ai had been testing patterns by dripping ink and letting it organically take shape. She often combines these naturally-formed ink splotches with more carefully controlled lines and patterns.  Next to the ink marks was a shelf with an animal skull, which we would later learn once belonged to a coyote. Born Ai Sogawa, the artist grew up in Osaka where her father, a businessman and jazz musician, was a regional manager at one of the largest jewelers in Japan. “He played saxophone and clarinet,” says Ai, recalling the countless times she heard jazz records growing up. “He still plays in three different bands and at several jazz clubs and is pretty serious.” Ai’s mother went to art school and studied sculpture, jewelry design, and ceramics. She actually worked in the design department of her now-husband’s company, which is how they met. “But I haven’t told you about the biggest artist in the family yet,” said Ai, as if issuing a warning. Hiroshi Hisatomi, Ai’s grandfather, was an industrial designer who owned a design firm in Osaka. Before WWII he kept himself busy by designing bicycles, cosmetic bottles and even golf courses. Somewhat of an eccentric, legend has it that he once telephoned an associate and had him drive his new Volkswagen from Osaka to come pick him up in Tokyo, which raised more than a few eyebrows. But when the war started, Hiroshi was deployed to South East Asia. He served as lieutenant and survived through the end of the war but, in the end, it was cancer that ended his life early before Ai was even born. The artist within lived on, however, and would later have a meaningful impact on Ai’s artistic career. After finishing art school in Japan Ai married an American and moved to the States where she continued her practice. Her style, which began as colorful and figurative, gradually transitioned to stark and celestial. “Abstract is more open to interpretation, which I liked,” Ai explained to us. But the real shift arrived one day in the form of a package from her mother. She opened it up to find postcard-sized prints of drawings her grandfather had made while he was away at war. “As a designer maybe this was his creative outlet,” speculated the granddaughter. “The consistent 5 x 7 inch works contained fine details in the vivid contrast of black and white. Because he passed away before I was born, those drawings were my only interactions with him.” “What books are on your shelf,” I asked, pointing to a cluster of English and Japanese books that sat behind paint jars. Ai reached for a minimal, cream-colored one, pulled it out and paused for a moment. It was “The Art of Margins” (yohaku no geijutsu) by the seminal Japan-based Korean artist Lee Ufan. Ai had encountered Lee Ufan several years ago – at the Kinokuniya bookstore in midtown Manhattan – in a similar fashion; she had instinctively reached for it on a book shelf as if it had flagged her down. Actually, it was the title of the book that had originally caught Ai’s attention. She had recently completed a session with a counselor who was going to help her better compose her artist’s statement. She had been convinced to embrace the Asianness of her work and her use of negative space. The book was an import from Japan and even at $80 Ai felt she had to have it. Not only did she read it cover-to-cover, the book sparked a research project into Lee Ufan – his work and his writing – that, most recently, had taken Ai to Naoshima, Teshima and other islands in Southern Japan where many of Ufan’s work can be found. Here is another quote that was underlined in Lee Ufan’s book:  Ai takes meticulous notes wherever she goes. She hates titling her work and struggles with conceptualizing it, but her notes help her keep a record of her thoughts. She’s intrigued by dichotomies but, specifically, those that aren’t always apparent. “For example,” she explains, “something that appears very clean and calm from a distance but it contains very intense details close up, or looks beautiful in a first look but after taking some time to examine what it really is, it actually looks almost disturbing.” Her work takes inspiration from rocks, geological stratum and other elements of nature that have taken form, layer by layer, over the years. But it’s true what they say about your environment, and how it shapes the way you see. Ai has been in NY now for 7 years and she’s also developed a keen fascination for the build-up of grime and filth on the subway system. Her photos, some of which she posts to instagram, are full of abstract shapes that may very well be stains or grime on train windows and floors. Though still in her 30s, Ai has been thinking a lot about death lately. “I find it amazing,” she says, referring to the coyote skull on her shelf, “that this once had skin over it and was moving around.” When you’re young life seems to go on forever. But looking at the skull “makes me realize that I really need to accomplish what I can today.” She smiles and says, proudly, “I also have a deer skull at home.” As usual, Huey (8) had some questions for Ai.

The packaging design and branding is just as stunning as their interior. There’s plenty to love about Sarutahiko’s new location too. Unlike their original in central Tokyo, the new shop is a lot more spacious. Floor to ceiling windows let plenty of light into the long and narrow shop.

He created woodblock prints of Mount Fuji that, to this day, remain iconic imagery of Japan. Hokusai’s name lives on through both commercial and artistic appropriation. But there’s one part of this narrative that’s often omitted from history: Hokusai had a daughter, Oei Katsushika, who was an accomplished artist in her own right. Although the exact dates of when she lived is unknown, she was thought to have been born around 1800. As legend has it, her peculiar name was derived from おい (Japanese for, “hey, you”), which is what her father called her. Oei established herself as an artist outside her father’s influence. But later in her life she divorced her husband and went to assist her father in his old age after he developed palsy. Only about 10 actual works have been attributed to Oei, but considering Katsushika Hokusai created some of his most famous and brilliant works towards the end of his life – “ The Great Wave off Kanagawa ” was published less than 10 years before his death at age 88 – it seems reasonable to wonder just how much of the work was created by Oei. And rather than start her own school after her father’s death Oi curiously seems to disappear from public record. We, of course, aren’t the first to have been intrigued by the allure of an unknown artist, especially the daughter of such prolificness. Katherine Govier authored “ The Printmaker’s Daughter ” on this exact subject back in 2011 writing, in the afterword, “How is it that a woman known by her peers to be ‘an excellent painter,’ as good as or better than her very famous ‘old man’ . . . can disappear from the record?” We reached out to Govier as we were curious as to what it was like researching the mysterious character for her novel: After spending several weeks in Japan, speaking with researchers, art historians and specialists Govier finally comes in contact with what will be the closest she has gotten to Oei: a letter, written in her hand around 1843. “He reads it to the translator who repeats it in English. And then her voice comes out of the silence, over that long, long distance: ‘We have never met,’ she says, ‘but I trust that you are well…’ ”","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["history"],"date":"March 11, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"The Science of Cuteness: How To Make Hello Kitty Appeal to Different Audiences","content":"Ever since Hello Kitty took her first faltering steps in 1974, she has been the reigning cute superpower.

Males have more blood flow to the left side of the brain while females have more blood flow to the right, hence the designation “male brain” (left) and “female brain” (right), says Dr. Stephen Bavolek ( PPT file ).

And now, let us look at his paintings.” Such is the nature of the enigmatic artist and perhaps one of the reasons the Japanese photographer Hisaji Hara has become obsessed with him to the point of dedicating his own career to photographically reenacting many of Balthus’s paintings. Hara’s photos are all in black and white and the artist has undergone meticulous and painstaking efforts not only to recreate the original paintings, but to make them look like they were shot in the 1960s. They were, in fact, all taken between 2006 and 2011 . But Hara’s photographs aren’t simply reproductions. While tipping his hat (or camera) to the French artist, Hara has added his own characteristically Japanese-ness to them. This often shows through in the costumes – adolescent schoolgirls and boys in school uniform – but also in the overall stylistic mood. Hara has made deliberate choices to alter some of Balthus’ more suggestive, sinister and disturbing scenes. But then again at other times he imbeds his own sense of Japanese eroticism. Danziger Gallery explains:  It’s also worth noting that Balthus’ 2nd wife was Japanese. The much younger Setsuko acted as interpreter when Balthus went to Japan on a cultural mission. The two later wed in the 1960s. I can only speculate, but this connection with Japan may have somehow influenced Hara. Hara spent a lot of time selecting models for his shoots. But in this rare occasion, Hara actually poses to recreate the French artist’s self-portrait.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["Photography","schoolgirls"],"date":"February 11, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"New Wooden Sculptures Made From Recycled Skateboards by Haroshi","content":"Tokyo-based artist Haroshi began skateboarding at the age of 15. But as he amassed interest in the sport, so too did his pile of skateboard decks and broken parts. Skaters will tell you that they go through new decks in 1 – 3 months. Some will even replace their decks every week so you can imagine how quickly these pile up. But instead of throwing them away, Haroshi decided to keep them. One day, when he decided to cut into one of the decks, Haroshi discovered a fascinating wooden mosaic pattern that was a result of the laminated layers of wood. The self-taught artist, now 37, has created dozens of sculptures over the last decade and his latest creations are  part of an upcoming solo exhibition in New York at Jonathan Levine Gallery . “ Still Pushing Despite the Odds ” opens this week on February 19 and incorporates “articles of low-technology from the early to mid-1900s. Vintage items such as neon signs, dental tools and roller skates create a striking textural contrast when paired with the smooth silhouette of the skate decks,” says the gallery. “Throughout their lifespan together the skater and his board get battered, but even so they get up again to face the obstacles in their path,” says Haroshi, explaining the meaning behind the title of his show. Although not always visible, Haroshi incorporates every part of the old skateboard into his sculptures. The metallic, non-malleable parts are often placed in the center as a “soul” of the sculpture. The process mimics a certain Japanese tradition: the sculpting of Great Buddhas. “90% of Buddha statues in Japan are carved from wood, and built using [the same method]” expalined Haroshi. Unkei, a 12-th century Japanese sculptor of Buddhas would set a crystal ball called (Heart Moon Circle) in the position of the Buddha’s heart. “ Still Pushing Despite the Odds ” runs through March 21, 2015.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["Green Design","sculpture","sporting"],"date":"February 16, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Rare Scenes Captured of Tokyo in Dense Fog","content":"When you think of foggy cities, Tokyo isn’t usually the first to come to mind.

However, criminals began covering their penal tattoos with decorative ones rendering the punishment obsolete. This is thought to be the historical origin of the association of tattooing and organized crime in Japan. In the early 18th century pictorial tattooing begins to flourish due, in part, to the development of (woodblock prints) and the needs of popular culture in Edo.

But even before it was a (or, shopping street) the pathway, just south of central Tokyo, flourished as a posting station where travelers heading to Tokyo on foot could rest. But now you’d have trouble even finding the shopping street. And even if you did, it’s hard to imagine its once illustrious past. “It used to be such a lively place with about 38 different shops,” recalls a local . As foot traffic began to dwindle, so did storefronts. And with inheritance taxes so prohibitive that it forced younger generations to sell their properties “now only 6 shops remain.” But a local design firm is trying to change things and breathe life back into the .  Owan Inc is design firm headquartered steps from the . They specialize in web and graphics but their real bread and butter is what they call “creative business design.” In their own words, “Owan’s objective is to create businesses that the we want to be involved in.” And they accomplish this through the tools available to them as designers to create “bowls with creative foundations,” hence the company’s name, which is bowl in Japanese. In 2011 they opened Pedra Branca , a café that was born from the simple desire “to create a space.” It was located along the Miyakawa Shotengai. In 2012, again along the same shopping street, the team launched Mr. Coffee . And now their third venture, an artisanal rice shop called Okomeya has opened for business. Jo Nagasaka of Schemata Architects , who was also responsible for the recent Blue Bottle in Tokyo , was commissioned to renovate a wooden building that used to be a vegetable shop. The space was very small – about 180 sq ft. But “we don’t need a big shop,” said Owan, perceiving the limitations as an advantage, rather than a disadvantage. “We would rather have a modest-sized shop to maintain one-staff operation.” And so became Okomeya, a shop that integrates with the community and finds sustainability in its passiveness. When staff has to leave the site for a moment they ask neighboring storeowners to keep an eye on the shop. “Such ‘small help’ between shops is crucial in maintaining small-sized businesses on local shopping streets,” explains Nagasaka. “these small shops are supported by the shopping street, and simultaneously the shopping street is reactivated by their success.” Pay Okomeya a visit and indulge in some freshly squeezed onigiri, or rice balls. You can, of course, also purchase organic rice and other rice-based products like rice vinegar.

The space combines a roastery and a café essentially providing an all-in-one factory that serves coffee directly from the beans it roasts. “Taking advantage of the light space created by the existing steel structure, we designed an environment that allows complete visibility in every direction,” explains Jo Nagasaka. “This creates a sense of movement between seemingly non-related spaces. We incorporated this movement into the overall design, which heightens the experience factory-to-cup coffee.” Starting February 6, 2015, Blue Bottle Coffee in Kiyosumi will be open from 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM.","post_categories":["Go and See"],"post_tags":["Blue Bottle","Schemata Architecture","tokyo guide","tokyo guide eat"],"date":"February 3, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Hypothetical Tokyo Ghibli Land Created by Japanese Illustrator TAKUMI","content":"Could you imagine a place more magical than Disney Land? The answer, arguably, is yes. And a Japanese illustrator who goes simply by the name TAKUMI has done exactly that. He’s created an illustrated version of Tokyo Ghibli Land, a hypothetical amusement park that incorporates rides and attractions all based on the beloved Ghibli films. The structure of the park is based on the circular shape of the original Disney Land: a circular park divided up into many “worlds” along the side and an iconic castle in the middle. However in Takumi’s version Cinderella’s Castle has been replaced by Howl’s Moving Castle. Tomorrowland, Fantasyland and Adventureland have also been seamlessly replaced by attractions modeled after Totoro, Laputa and Naussica. And of course encircling the entire park is a Cat Bus monorail. The artist has even gone so far as to envision hotel facilities. “Visitors could stay in the Bathhouse [from Spirited Away] or the Hotel Adriana [from Porco Rosso]” wrote the artist. He also added that he plans to add food menus in the near future as well. So could this dream park become a reality? An amusement park of this scale is highly unlikely. Ghibli simply doesn’t seem to have the type of marketing engine to raise fund like Disney or Pixar. They did, however, create the Ghibli Museum in 2001.

While highly influential, the Japanese artist, who combined elements of Dadaism, Surrealism and Minimalism, created works that were conceptual – often cerebral – to the point of turning you off. As part of the collective Hi Red Center, Takamatsu flung the contents of a suitcase off the rooftop of a famous ikebana school’s headquarters. The artist was also charged with counterfeiting – he was subsequently found guilty – for creating one-sided reproductions of a thousand yen note. On display through March 1, 2015, A new exhibition at Momat (The National Museum of Modern Art Tokyo) hopes to shine a light, quite literally at times, on this enigmatic artist. “The exhibition opens with the ‘shadow laboratory’ says Torafu Architects , who were tasked with staging a lofty exhibition space where visitors could wander through Takamatsu’s legacy. Inspired by images of shadows in 19th-century Japanese painting and woodcuts, Takamatsu created his Shadow Painting series in enamel and acrylic. The shadow paintings are surreal and seductive. Curator Yuri Matsuda summed it up best when she characterized the encounter of one’s real shadow with a painted shadow as the “peter pan point.” Visitors are then led into the main exhibition space where structural columns of varying widths delineate the landscape. Finally, visitors reach the last section where a hidden stage is located at the center of the venue. Designed to be reminiscent of Takamatsu’s studio, all the works can be viewed as a collective whole. Quotes from the artist are also displayed. “The size of the stage symbolically echoes Takamatsu’s sphere of creation since its dimensions match that of the studio where he worked during his active period,” says the architects. “ Jiro Takamatsu: Mysteries ” runs through March 1, 2015.

He quickly came to the realization that being unpopular with girls is a class issue. Since then, the group has held several demonstrations each year, all coinciding with holidays that are associated with romantic love in Japanese culture, such as Valentine’s Day, Christmas, and White Day . Kakuhidou’s slogans combine Japanese internet culture with classical Marxism, and its origins in cyberspace can be charted through its choice of language. For example, one frequent target of the group’s admonitions are the so-called “riyajuu” (リア充）, a neologism frequently used in online communities such as 2chan to refer to those who experience fulfillment in their offline lives (riyajuu is a portmanteau that combines “real” with “jyuujitsu”, the Japanese word for fulfillment). The release posted on Kakuhidou’s website for this year’s anti-Valentines parade says “the blood-soaked conspiracy of Valentine’s Day, driven by the oppressive chocolate capitalists, has arrived once again. In order to create a brighter future, we call for solidarity among our unloved comrades, so that we may demonstrate in resolute opposition to Valentine’s Day and the romantic industrial complex.” At previous events, leaders of the group have yelled slogans such as “I hope all riyajuus explode! But we’re still a little jealous!” while wearing shirts that say, roughly, “sex is useless.” Despite the group’s left-leaning tendencies, their official vehicle is a Mercedes-Benz C220. The group is once again planning a large demonstration, but this year in Yoyogi Park (not Miyashita Park like previous years) on February 12, 2018.

But of course they don’t. The Nagasawa Dental Clinic in Hachioji is Matsuba’s latest work and is consistent with his firm’s aesthetic of creating “architecture that feels strange.” And strange it is. When it opened late last year in the Western suburb of Tokyo several residents who drove by had to make a u-turn to come back for a 2nd look. The three blocky structures are a parking garage, residence and dental clinic. The residence sits on top of the garage and clinic, appearing to float in mid-air. The placement of the 3 blocks – the garage close to the road, the clinic as far away as humanly possible, and the home barely resting on the edge – “achieved our two goals,” said Matsuba. “Making the parking space easy to use and emphasizing the presence of the structures.” Kunihiko Matsuba is a young architect, was born in 1979. In addition to running his architectural firm he also organizes a series of events called AKITEN (short for akiteｎpo or,　”vacant stores”).

For all its might and glory, Daikanyama T-site surprised many because, in essence, it was a rejection of digital and a celebration of everything analog – books, magazines and curated retail shops. The big bet on books by media and entertainment giant Tsutaya, which operates the complex, seems to be paying off. Three years later the 2nd iteration, Shonan T-Site , has now opened and is ushering in a new demographic in an upcoming suburb about an hour South of Tokyo. The structure itself, like its older sister, was designed by Klein Dytham Architects (KDa) and there are considerable similarities. As you approach the complex, the first thing you see is a cascading ivy motif plastered across the exterior, a nod to the company name Tsutaya, says Dytham (蔦屋 is literally “ivy house” in Japanese). “This leaf motif complements the iconic woven “T” pattern used in the Daikanyama project.” The layout is pretty straightforward: 3 two-level buildings sit back-to-back, each with their own designations. Building 1 is “Entertainment” (stationary shops, camera supplies and beauty salon) while building 2 is “Food/Life” (bakeries, restaurants and designy shops). Over in building 3 is “Family / Fujisawa SST Square” where you can take cooking classes, shop for kids toys and even rent EV cars. Uniting these diverse shops is an almost 400-ft long “Magazine Street” that cuts through the three buildings like a shotengai shopping street. But one major difference between the Daikanyama location, which is surrounded by embassies and upscale fashion boutiques, is, well, the lack thereof. Besides the fact that the site was near the water, there were really no other major landmarks and context. This posed the challenge of creating a natural, approachable structure. “One major influence was the fact it is located just 2km from the Shonan coast,” say the architects, referring to the laid-back known for its surf culture. “This resulted in a relaxed, informal and accessible dimension to the overall design of the project.” Although in the U.S. shoppers continue to unplug from shopping malls and outlets, in Japan it’s a different story. And that was the idea behind Fujisawa Sustainable Smart Town (FSST), a former Panasonic TV factory site. Again, KDa explains: “The area is currently being developed into a model smart town, with the creation of 1,000 highly efficient solar-powered homes designed to accommodate a modern and connected community. Shonan T-SITE forms the centrepiece of the development.”","post_categories":["Architecture","Go and See"],"post_tags":["Klein Dytham","mall","tokyo guide","tokyo guide shop","tsutaya"],"date":"January 22, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Noma Japan’s Shrimp Are Served Covered In Ants","content":"Chef and restaurateur René Redzepi has temporarily relocated himself and his entire staff to Japan.

The Japanese architect converted Hiroshima’s barren ground zero into a tranquil peace park (1954), housed 13,00 bureaucrats in the massive New Tokyo City Hall (1991), created the iconic Fuji Television Building (1997), and much more. Now, a new exhibition at Gallery MA in Tokyo looks at the architecture through the eyes of the architect. Kenzo Tange, the first Japanese architect to win the Pritzker Architecture Prize, is responsible for over 330 works of architecture in 31 countries. In Kenzo Tange: 20th Century Masters , Paolo Riani wrote that in Tokyo “there were not even the mountains of rubble of German towns; the wooden structures had gone up in flames and smoke.” So it’s understandable why Tange turned to concrete, which, in turn, became the impetus in advancing his Metabolist school of urban design. He once professed his love for concrete by saying, “Just like the stone inspired those of the middle ages, concrete will likely bring contemporary inspiration to the people.” Tange by Tange 1949 – 1959 is indeed a retrospective of the architect. But it’s organized primarily through the eyes of the architect himself. That is, through photographs of his own work taken by Tange himself. The exhibition presents a picture of Tange’s early years through contact sheets of 35-millimeter film images that capture not only his own work but also works of traditional architecture. “They form an elaborate record of his activities… and reveal how the young Tange had been engaging with architecture.” Tange by Tange 1949 – 1959 is on display at Gallery MA in Tokyo through March 28, 2015.","post_categories":["Events"],"post_tags":["Japanese architecture","tokyo guide","tokyo guide art shows"],"date":"January 27, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Kudamemo: Non-perishable fruit note pads","content":"Here’s some non-perishable fruit that won’t go bad in the mail.

But you would have to be stupid not to. And he gives some fairly convincing reasons why the fart is the perfect joke: it comes out of your ass, it smells like poop because it’s been hanging out next to it all day long, and it announces itself with a toot noise when it comes out. Of course, Louis CK wasn’t the first to realize the inherent comedic effect of farts. And since today is National Pass Gas Day , I thought it would be appropriate to recall one of the most epic acts of flatulent artistry. Over 150 years ago a group of anonymous Japanese artists created a 34-ft long scroll titled He-Gassen (屁合戦), literally: “Fart Battle.” The scroll, which was created during the Edo Period (probably around 1846) in Japan, consists of roughly 15 different scenes depicting people directing their farts at other people or objects. There are people farting at each other. There are people farting through objects. There are people combating farts with fans. There are bags of farts being released. Trees and cats get blown away by farts. And the scroll culminates with a divine gust of flatulence knocking over a ceremony and causing complete and utter chaos. So why did these artists create this scroll? Some have argued that it’s a form of social commentary depicting anti-foreigner sentiment as Japan was beginning to emerge from isolation. Others feel we try to read too much into the art and that it was created simply because farts are funny. This scroll definitely isn’t alone in its sub-genre. There were many artists practicing Ukiyo-e – woodblock prints that emerged as a form of low-brow entertainment – who took up flatulence as a way to gain laughs. Several of these prints even resurface at auction houses every once in a while. The scroll in its entirety was digitized by Waseda University and can be seen in hi-res format by accessing their database .

The elasticity of the fabric envelops the dog’s body as the smell and feeling of the fabric sets it at ease. Wanmock is part of Architecture For Dogs , a project invented by architects and designers to create a sincere collection of architecture to make dogs and their owners happy. Co-founded by Kenya Hara (of MUJI fame) and Imprint Venture Lab, the project enlisted 13 luminary architects from Japan and around the world (Shigeru Ban, Toyo Ito, Kengo Kuma and Torafu, just to name a few) to create a doghouse. One of those designs – the Wanmock Kit – is now available through the Spoon & Tamago shop. Simply pull an old t-shirt, sweatshirt or sweater over the wooden frame.

The majority of designs focused on watches and they ranged from the pretty to the ugly. But in the end, the award for best wearable technology went to Jins, and Japanese eyewear maker, and their Jins Meme smartglasses. Looking almost exactly like regular glasses seems to have gotten them a lot of points in the “socially acceptable” category (there’s no such thing – we made that up). The Jins Meme glasses come in 3 different styles and, according to the company, are the first glasses that “look into you.” “Say you’re driving long-distance, and you’re really tired,” explains Jins representative Lilian Wouters, “[the glasses will notice] and your smartphone will alert you to pull over and rest.” In their assessment for awarding Jins Meme with top place, Digital Trends noted that the glasses use accelerometers and velocity sensors to “determine your posture and step count (like any fitness tracker), but it also has electrodes fitted to the nose pads that can help track eye movement and blinking, which allows it to do a lot of amazing things, including monitoring how fatigued you are.” And when it comes to the industry-plaguing issue of looking unacceptably ugly? “Jins Meme does not have this problem.”","post_categories":["Interactive/ Technology"],"post_tags":["glasses","wearable"],"date":"January 13, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Flower Bouquets Frozen in Blocks of Ice by Makoto Azuma","content":"Over the weekend, a factory two hours North West of Tokyo, in a small town in Saitama, was converted into an art gallery. Botanical artist Azuma Makoto and his team were putting on an installation and, when they were done, 16 large blocks of ice stood, lined in columns of three on the concrete floors of the factory. It was like Stonehenge for the ice age. Within the shimmering blocks of ice were exotic flower bouquets, frozen in time. In recent years the perennial botanical artist Makoto Azuma has been interested in observing flower bouquets in unique settings, offering a perspective on the life and death of the plant that is often ignored in traditional flower arrangements. He’s suspended plants in midair using wires, stuffed flower petals into bottles and, most recently, even launched flower bouquets into space . “Flowers will show unique expressions that they do not display in everyday life, by placed under such a different environment,” said Azuma, referring to his Iced Flowers installation. Perhaps it’s something about this time of year when the frigid weather has people thinking about ice. Last month we wrote about photographer Kenji Shibata’s new series depicting flowers in thawing ice . Shibata found poignant beauty in the way ice melts and the flowers, whose beauty could have been preserved, are tossed back into the merciless cycle of time. The artist posted a fascinating video that shows how they mystical cubes of ice were created:","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["flowers","makoto azuma"],"date":"January 14, 2015"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Five Sculptors: an exhibition surveying contemporary Japanese sculpture","content":"Wooden masks hang on the wall.

The cultural revolution against the notion that faster is always better began with food but has since spread to a vast array of sub-categories like slow fashion, slow art and slow education. Now, the Japanese are embracing the cultural shift toward slowing down the pace of life and applying it to taxis. The Sanwa Koutsu taxi company, which primarily operates in and around Yokohama and Tokyo, recently began rolling out Turtle Taxis . If you’re not in a hurry, are pregnant, are feeling queasy, or have any other reason you want your taxi to slow down, simply push the turtle button located in the passenger seat. This activates a turtle mark on the outside of the cab indicating to other drivers that the car is driving slowly. “Drivers have had special training, and provide not only slow driving but also a safer and more comfortable drive than usual for their passengers,” explains the company. The service began in December of last year and so far the taxis have traveled at turtle’s pace for over 10,000 km. The eco-driving, as the company calls it, “is achieved by driving without sudden acceleration or sudden stopping.” It’s better for the environment because it improves fuel efficiency, but it also saves on gas prices. But the company has found that it’s good for business in other ways too. According to a poll conducted by IMJ , the branding and advertisement agency responsible for the campaign, contrary to popular belief taxi riders are not always in a hurry. In fact, 76% of people polled said that they’ve wanted their cab driver to slow down. And the new turtle service is showing up in the company’s numbers too. Sanwa Koutsu reported that they say a 113% increase in call compared to a year earlier. I don’t know about your city, but New York taxis could certainly learn a thing or two from slowing down.

It is the specific location, and the constraints that it poses, the lends power to Asai’s art. After traveling the world and, most recently, staging his first solo show in the U.S., Asai has returned to Japan for “Creating Here,” a three-dimensional installation of organic, web-like branches that deviate from his typically two-dimensional murals. Coloring directly onto masking tape and paper and then stretching them from floor to ceiling, Asai creates a web of organisms and botanical motifs that almost resemble an invasive species slowly encompassing the white walls of the gallery.

Our little blog turned 8 this year (what, is that like 75 in Internet years?) and the newest addition to our family, the shop , turned 1. But aside from just growing older (FYI – not any wiser) 2014 saw some longer-term projects come to fruition. Back in 2012 we wrote about a daring little artist , a puffer fish, who created fantastic “crop circles” on the bottom of the sea to attract mates. The article was easily the most popular for us that year but it also attracted the attention of the BBC, who got in touch with us about shooting the fish for a documentary. We helped coordinate the shoot and are happy to report that, after many months, the documentary finally aired ! Another bit of good news this year is that the Papa’s Maze, which we wrote about last year and are exclusively selling in our shop , got picked up by two Japanese TV  stations , marking our official debut on Japanese television. Heading to Tokyo? This year we launched a new feature to the site: A Tokyo Guide ! We have curated, intimated guides by locals, as well as our picks for art, shopping eating and playing. Thanks so much to our readers, new and old! Happy Holidays and we will each and every one of you a splendid 2015. We’ll now step back behind the curtain as we present to you, the 10 most popular posts of 2014. We covered the arrest of Megumi Igarashi (aka Rokudenashiko), an artist who scanned her genitals to create a vagina kayak (hereon referred to as a vagayak). In the article, and on twitter , we argued that the arrest represented a complete double-standard in a country that sanctions an annual penis festival. Igarashi was released but then arrested a second time earlier this month , reigniting the debate over censorship and women’s rights in Japan. How cool would it be if everyone had a sushi suitcase cover. Imagine what the conveyor belt at the luggage pick-up terminal would look like! How can you improve on something like chopsticks that have been around for hundreds of years? One designer turned to our DNA for inspiration.

And New York’s Mass Transit Authority (MTA) is trying to get rid of it. Early this week they announced a new series of campaigns encouraging polite and considerate behavior on the trains. One of their targets was , the spreading of legs which looks distasteful and takes up too much space. Up until now it seemed as though the MTA was turning a blind eye to the issue, prompting riders to take matters into their own hands and publicly  shame offenders. But surprisingly, Japan, the epitome of politeness, at least in the eyes of the West, has been an pioneer in the field with targeted anti-manspreading campaigns dating back to the 1970s. In the 1970s the graphic designer Hideya Kawakita created a series of humorous and highly eye-catching posters to encourage better manners on the train. This one above was inspired by Charlie Chaplin’s “The Great Dictator.” In 2010 a campaign was created that featured minimal pictograms of people behaving properly and rudely on trains. Note the two with tilted heads, in utter shock at seeing such inconsiderate manspreading. Interestingly, it was created in collaboration with Japan Tabacco, who had created a series of campaigns aimed at proper smoking etiquette. In 2011 the Tokyo Metro ran a series of campaigns that used adorable cats and dogs to subtly and cutely remind us that we’re not animals. The title reads, “I’ve seen someone like this.” A 2012 poster featuring a fuzzy teddy bear (?) unable to understand why this dude’s legs are spread so wide. In 2013, the Odakyu Line in Tokyo licensed several characters created by illustrator Yusaku Hanakuma to try and promote proper train etiquette.  Several dudes with afros sit together taking up too much space while the man standing is thinking, “that seat should fit 7.”","post_categories":["Graphic Design"],"post_tags":["manners","trains"],"date":"December 25, 2014"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Tokujin Yoshioka Designs Transparent Firefox Smartphone","content":"Some Christmas presents are large.

And while the “brand-new transparent smartphone” doesn’t represent the diaphanous mobile future that movies like Minority Report had us dreaming of, it’s still an attractive device that aims to recapture the smartphone market that Japan has lost out on vis-à-vis Apple. In order to express the openness that Firefox stands for, Tokujin incorporated a design that captures and exposes the beauty of the mechanical insides. “The Firefox logo is placed in on the home button to identify the originality through the front design of the body,” says Yoshioka. “This will be a model that symbolizes a new stage for Firefox OS smartphone.”","post_categories":["Industrial Design","Interactive/ Technology"],"post_tags":["mozilla","Tokujin Yoshioka"],"date":"December 26, 2014"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"A Designer Ramen Bowl Exhibition","content":"It says something about the popularity of ramen when there are design exhibitions dedicated solely to its vessel. And such an exhibition just opened in Tokyo: the “ Mino Ramen Bowl Exhibition .” 25 unique ramen bowls have been designed by some of Japan’s most well-known artists, designers and architects such as Junya Ishigami, Taku Sato and Tadanori Yokoo. The exhibition, produced by the Japan Design Committee , brings together craftsmen from Mino City, one of Japan’s largest pottery centers that also happens to produce about 90% of all ramen bowls. Ramen shops in Japan are at a historic high without 35,000 shops throughout the country serving up salty soup and noodles. I don’t have the numbers to back me up but here in New York I’ve noticed a precipitous rise in ramen shops in the last several years. An unofficial search on Yelp yielded 1568 results for “ramen.” For historic data, a chronicle search in the NYT would indicate a rise. I think it’s fair to say that, alongside sushi, ramen has become one of Japan’s most well-known ambassadors (despite its Chinese roots). So it makes sense to use ramen to telegraph Japan’s design sensibilities as well.

Apparently, Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance, who was celebrating its centennial the next year, saw the painting as an appropriate birthday present to itself. The purchase not only made the company famous but it also set off an art-buying craze amongst Japanese companies who were at the top of the world thanks to an overheated economy and  rapid acceleration of asset process. No one saw the cracks that would burst Japan’s bubble just 4 years later. The top of the market may very-well have been 1990, when Japan imported more than $4 billion in art as they gobbled up almost half of all Impressionist art put on the market. Ryoei “wild fellow” Saito, Chairman of the Daishowa Paper Manufacturing empire, paid $160 million to acquire the world’s two most expensive paintings–a Van Gogh and a Renoir. Fast-forward to 2014 and Japan looks a lot different. Many of those corporates who bought up art are bankrupt and – even more unfortunate – a lot of that art is missing . Saito caused a global uproar after reportedly telling friends he wanted the paintings burned as part of his cremation so his heirs could avoid inheritance tax. This probably didn’t happen but, none-the-less, much of the art remains MIA. However, there’s one place where the art and the company that owned it survived: Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance. Although the company has gone through several changes and is now known as Sompo Japan Nipponkoa , their museum , housed on the 42nd floor of their corporate headquarters, remains. The collection boasts well-known classics like the aforementioned Van Gogh, a Renoit a Cézanne and a Gauguin, but also a respectable amount of Japanese painters from the 30s – 60s. In fact, one of their most well-represented Japanese painters is Seiji Togo, who became famous for his surrealist artwork depicting women, but also for his tempestuous love affairs . He made blaring newspaper headlines in 1930 when he attempted to commit suicide with 2 different lovers, two years in a row. Just recently in September the insurance company’s museum rebranded itself as the Seiji Togo Memorial and adopted as its logo one of Togo’s most well-known works of art: “Surrealistic Stroll.” Auguste Renoir ”Young Woman with a Hat” (1910).

A gigantic balloon was painted in the likeness of a local ojisan (old man) and then inflated to create “ The Day an Ojisan’s Face Floated in the Sky ” (おじさんの顔が空に浮かぶ日). That day was December 13, 2014 but for those who missed it there’s another date scheduled for this weekend. The nonsensical installation is based on a dream that artist Haruka Kojin – 1 of the 3 members of art trio – had when she was in junior high. To make the nonsensical dream come true, last year the artists set up a booth on a crowded shopping street and asked locals to submit their face for consideration. Of all the candidates, 1 ojisan was selected and his face was printed onto a gigantic balloon using pointillism. It took 2 months and over 67,000 dots. The project was nicknamed ojisora . Once it was inflated the face was 15 meters high and 10 meters wide. For those who missed the first launch, there is one more launch this weekend (December 20, 2014).

The uncommon band consists of the Basscar with a Dubstep-like sound, the Glitchcar that aims at reproducing computer-like sounds, the Melodycar, Arpeggiocar, and the Drumcar to add rhythm to the composition. The Color Chasers are just one of Suzuki’s many music-related projects. The artist has been exploring the shapes that music can take for a while, leading him to collaborate on will.i.am’s Dreaming About the Future earlier this year.

Please don’t throw them away after a single use. Or 10 uses. Or 100 uses. The tm series of tableware by Japanese design firm ideaco was carefully designed to mimic the look and feel of disposable paper plates. By brilliantly using bamboo powder the design team managed to achieve practically the same weight and texture as disposable paper, making them ideal for both indoor and outdoor eating. We’re proud to be able to carry the sustainable and environmentally friendly plates , bowls and cups in our shop! Why bamboo? Bamboo clocks in as the fastest growing plant on earth. A pole of bamboo can regenerate to its full mass in just 6 months (compared to conventional wood which takes 30-50 years). And bamboo can be grown sustainably on land that can’t be used for food crops. Bamboo is also just a strong and durable as wood, if not more… In recognition of the tm series’ emphasis on design and sustainability, it was awarded a 2014 red dot design award .

In a new series titled “ Locked in the ether ,” the Osaka-based photographer creates flower ice cubes and then photographs them as they are thawing. Time and the perpetual present is beautifully yet painfully forced onto his lens as clocks begin to tick away once again.

The artist pockets half of the revenue while the company takes the other half.

Her hobbies, she says, include napping, arts and crafts and collecting masking tape. “I own about 450 rolls,” she told* a reporter earlier this year , referring to her ever-growing collection of making tape. “Whenever I find a color or pattern that I like I end up buying it.” So it was only a matter of time before Funahara turned to her massive collection for creative solutions too. That time came when Funahara decided to use some of her tape for a school assignment. And she knew she was on to something. After displaying her work at a school festival and receiving overwhelming feedback she began creating a series of masking tape artworks that replicate famous paintings like, Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring and Van Gogh’s Sunflowers. Each work is fairly large – about the size of a tatami mat, she says – and takes about 1 week to complete. Funahara works from an image of the painting in front of her but primarily uses freehand to cut and paste the bits of masking tape as she builds out her creation. You can see more of her work on portfolio site Loftwork . Those familiar with Japanese names are probably curious about Funahara’s first name Nasa which, by almost any standard, is not a typical Japanese name. “Both my parents worked in the aeronautics and space industry,” explains Nasa. “On the day before I was born Mamoru Mohri went into space on the Space Shuttle Endeavour. To commemorate the occasion my parents named me Nasa.” It’s interesting to see masking tape evolve from a behind-the-scenes tool to an actual material used to create art. Masking tape was originally used to mark off areas where paint wasn’t desired. But in Japan in particular the tape, which is often made from washi, has evolved into a decorative tool that comes in a dizzying array of colors and patterns.

Thanks to a motion sensor, the facing turns on when the user turns his wrist to look at the watch, and then fades out. But the team does not intend to stop there. According to TAKT PROJECT, the watch facings will be editable by FES users, and the studio plans to mass-produce the object earlier next year. The first batch of watches has already been successfully backed on Japanese crowd-funding site Makuake.  But they’ve recently reopened the project allowing those who are interested a change to purchase the watch. The team is also working on other project with Fashion Entertainments, and aims to release new designs that explore the relationship between technology, physical objects and people.

On my roof?” That winning question could be yours if you lived in “Secret Garden,” the latest home designed by architect Hisanori Ban . It all started many years ago when the current homeowners went camping with the family one summer. They stumbled upon a ravine and decided to venture down into it where they discovered a beautiful yet secretive spot tucked away from the other swarms of campers. After the trip the family returned home only with memories of the distant spot. Never would they think it would be reincarnated into their home. The fairly large plot of land, located in Komaki City (Aichi prefecture) was located on a busy street, explained Ban , and was used as a primary commuting route for a nearby elementary school. The architect spoke with the family and learned about the concerns they had about privacy and the need for a secluded space. During their conversations he also learned of their camping trip and decided to give them their long lost secret ravine on top of their home. Ban was able to take advantage of the sloping plot of land and create a garden that slopes up towards the sky. The concrete wall shrinks as the garden rises, creating privacy where needed but also allowing for a sense of spaciousness.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["architecture-outdoors-in","architecture-residential","garden"],"date":"October 28, 2014"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Kimono Artist Hiroko Takahashi’s New Studio and Gallery Space","content":"Discontinued and abandoned factories in Japan are being given a second life. Large companies like Toshiba and Fujitsu have been converting obsolete semiconductor factories into indoor gardens where they hope to turn lettuce into cash. But it’s not only major corporations who can play this game. Earlier this month artist Takahashi Hiroko , a textile artist who has been broadening the boundaries of kimonos by incorporating geometric, black & white patterns into the traditional wear, announced that she had relocated into a renovated steel factory in Tokyo. Located two minutes away from Oshiage station and situated nearby Tokyo Sky Tree, the new space officially opened on October 17. However, before it could open, several structural issues needed to be addressed. The original building, which was hastily constructed in the early 70s, was based on “quantity over quality,” explained Jo Nagasaka of Schemata Architects . “You can see various gaps and distortions all over the building.” But instead of trying to fix all of the imperfections the artist and architects decided to accept the factory for what it was. “We intend to transform these gaps and distortions into unique spaces where one encounters unexpected experiences.” The result is a lovely interval between new and old and is quite fitting for an artist who is working with a traditional craft form in a new and exciting way. Through November 15, 2014 Takahashi will be hosting “ Renovation ,” an exhibition of her latest kimonos there were inspired by her new space. Once the exhibition closes the showroom will resume normal hours and will be open to the public on Fridays, Saturdays and Holidays 11:00 – 20:00.

With a cremation rate of that’s nearly 100% , Japan and their corpse count, or lack thereof, would seem an ideal place to to ride out a plague of the undead. In the text that follows I would like to analyze the pros and cons of the East vs. the West, so that each of us can make informed decisions regarding our own contingency plans for the impending zombie pandemic. First, when we model out the spread of a zombie pandemic the most essential question is its origination. If the zombie outbreak first originates outside of Japan, and there are no signs of lengthy incubation periods, an initial assessment of the situation may justly lead many to flee to Japan as soon as possible. With very few corpses lying around in the ground, and an ocean surrounding the country, Japan seems to be ideally positioned as a place to not get your brains chewed out. However, in an entirely different scenario, where the outbreak occurs in Japan, one can easily imagine the devastating consequences of being in the land of the rising dead. In a previous essay , Jim Hawe makes some excellent assertions that question the core of Japan’s safety profile. First of all, the geographic make-up of Japan could be tragically disadvantageous. Densely populated urban areas serve as ideal feeding grounds. And very little land to actually run to, coupled with the likely probability that other countries would deny you entry due to fear of contamination, certainly raises questions about Japan’s zombie outbreak preparedness. The lack of guns and other heavy artillery has served Japan well in maintaing a safe, civil and peaceful society over the years. But, just as equally, this will be a crippling weakness as the unaffected desperately search for means to fend off their attackers. Although popularized as an ideal weapon in the Max Brooks novel “ World War Z ,” in reality any type of samurai sword would prove much more problematic than one might imagine. “Bladed weapons in general are not ideal because they will inevitably get stuck in things and become dull,” said Matt Mogk, founder and head researcher of Zombie Research Society (ZRS). There is an important component that often gets overlooked when analyzing the fundamental zombie preparedness of Japan. And that is the cultural, and I would argue, genetic, differences between eastern and western zombies. For those who are not familiar, allow me to introduce the kyonshi (殭屍), the Asian zombie. Claiming ancestry in China, the kyonshi (which terrified the sh*t out of me as a child) have several noteworthy characteristics that, I would argue, make them less competitive compared to their Western counterparts. Currently the only known way to quiet a zombie is to bash their brains in. This is a task that is as difficult as it is gruesome, and only slightly easier if aided by a shotgun. However, can be sedated by tactically placing a small scroll with buddhist inscriptions on the forehead (as pictured above). Also, (and this helps in assisting the first objective) are legally blind. They detect human presence from the smell of our breath, making a cornered escape realistically possible by simply holding your breath. are also known to have hardened joints, rendering their arms and legs inflexible. They mobilize their bodies by hopping, extending their arms in front of them to maintain balance. While this can serve as an initial disadvantage, it is worth pointing out that, over time, their joints are known to soften, allowing them to walk and in some cases even run. There is scientific literature that backs up the claim that hate mirrors and being pee’d on. So as long as you have your vanity and stay hydrated you have several choices for defense, without resorting to shotguns and crowbars. This leads me to my final point. Despite their obvious non-competitive traits, should not be taken lightly. As Sun Tzu famously wrote in Art of War, “know thy enemy.” So store this information in an accessible location. It will undoubtedly serve you well as you seek survival.","post_categories":["Events","Interactive/ Technology","shop"],"post_tags":["halloween","Preparedness","zombie"],"date":"October 31, 2014"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"The Single Stroke Artwork of Kazuhiko Okushita","content":"Film director and animator Kazuhiko Okushita creates unique artwork using a technique known as – one of those great Japanese words that doesn’t really have an English equivalent.

When the last train rolls into the station it’s usually quiet with the exception of a few drunk salarymen stumbling home. But on this particular night the station was buzzing with activity.

Taking the word pan – bread in Japanese, derived from the Portuguese word pao – and combining it with the word lampshade (why wouldn’t you?) yields the Pampshade . It all started back in 2006 when Yukiko Morita , a teenager at the time, got a part-time job working at a small bakery in Kyoto. It was there that she discovered her passion for bread and yeast. “I love bread. Bread is cute,” she says. “I want to display it in my room and stare at it.” However, bread’s (and all food, for that matter) decompositional properties kept her from doing this. So, Morita began working on a bread prototype that could double as interior design. Morita enrolled in art school in 2008 but after she graduated she once again began focusing her efforts on the pampshade. And now, at Tokyo Design Week, her labors of love were on display in a series of lamps made from loaves of bread and then covered in a layer of resin. The ingredients for her creations, says Morita, are “Bread flour, salt, yeast, LED, batteries,” and some other secret ingredients she won’t share.","post_categories":["Industrial Design"],"post_tags":["Lighting","Tokyo Designers Week","tokyo designers week 2014"],"date":"November 3, 2014"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"A Tokyo Apartment With a Built-In Cafeteria","content":"When the Chairman of a local shopping street and his son decided it was time to tear down their old building, they didn’t want just another condo in its place.

But now the former facility that manufactured semiconductors is turning over a new leaf . Workers at the plant have undergone a major career change and are now using state-of-the-art technology to raise crops like lettuce, baby leaf greens, spinach, mizuna and herbs. It’s quite a shift, you might think. But there are actually more similarities between semiconductor production and farming than you might have imagined. What has become one of the world’s largest indoor farms, the project reuses a sealed, bacteria-excluding “clean room” to grow organic vegetables, cut them and package them for distribution. But that’s not the only thing being reused. Long-wave fluorescent lights, an air-conditioning system that keeps the temperature and humidity at fixed levels, an infrared surveillance system and a sanitizing system that sterilizes packaging are all optimal for producing semiconductors but also for growing salad vegetables. But what’s a farm without buyers? Enter Nendo , the renowned design firm led by Oki Sato. Taking advantage of the hydroponically produced salad’s long shelf-life (since it has no contact with insects or bacteria) Nendo created a fun packaging container that looks like a smoothie cup. “We named the project ‘1 Week Salad,’” explains Sato, to emphasize its natural freshness. They also “designed internal paper packaging that riffs on the ‘best by date’ sticker found on all food products. Each of the 31 days uses different colors and typefaces for the stand-up numbers so that the products’ shelf experience is fresh and constantly changing.” Faced with stiff competition from neighbors like Korea and China, Japan, which once dominated the world with their electronics, has been losing share. But it looks like company management is finally getting creative.

But he’s not the next savior. He’s Yasuhiro Suzuki, a young Japanese artist who has a penchant for re-envisioning the ordinary as extraordinary. Suzuki’s big break came early in 2001 when the artist – still only 22 – created an installation for the NHK TV show Digital Stadium. Suzuki filmed children playing on a jungle gym during the day and then projected the imagery onto that same jungle gym at night, creating a haunting yet arresting perspective. This not only won Suzuki national attention, but also the trust he needed to pull off grander installations such as a large funnel that would spew hundreds of leaves into the air. The leaves, which had images of eyes wide open on one side and shut on the other, would appear to be blinking as they fluttered to the ground. Another memorable piece was a zipper-shaped boat that steered across a lake creating the illusion that water was being unzipped. Now Suzuki’s artwork is the subject of an exhibition at Art Tower Mito in Ibaragi, an hour and a half Northeast of Tokyo. The show, which runs through October 19, will feature a mix of new and old work that will make you look at your surroundings differently. Suzuki’s subject matter is often banal – a traditional toy, a zipper or a tree stump. In the most literal sense, his work is devoted to the design of daily life. The exhibition space was designed by Tokyo-based Wonderwall . “The spaces are partitioned with walls so that the line of flow converge and cross each other as one advances through the exhibit,” says lead architect Masamichi Katayama. “This has allowed us to effectively display the artist’s signature large-scale works, such as ‘Perspective of the Globe Jungle,’ ‘Balloon Being,’ and ‘Blinking Leaves.'”","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["tokyo guide","tokyo guide art shows","Wonderwall","Yasuhiro Suzuki"],"date":"October 14, 2014"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"A Cubic Rubber Band That You’ll Never Want to Throw Away","content":"Natural rubber bands have been around since the 1600s and they were patented (and formally institutionalized) in England in 1845. But despite their long history, they’ve always pretty much remained the same shape, which is, of course, circular. This is only natural as the circle shape seems to be most fitted for holding objects. And the only criticism people seem to have is that they are overly expendable. Leave it to the Japanese to reinvent the un-reinventable. Tokyo and Milan-based design firm Nendo have designed a cubic rubber band as part of a series of designy stationery items. “The geometrical shapes make the bands easy to find in a drawer and easy to pick up,” says Oki Sato, the lead designer. The cubic rubber bands are incredibly stylish and would make a great desktop accessory. Also, a pack of 3 retails for 1080 yen so these are definitely not rubber bands that you would toss after a single use!","post_categories":["Industrial Design"],"post_tags":["Nendo","stationery"],"date":"October 14, 2014"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Seasonal Steel Paintings by Miya Ando Seek Balance Between the Man-Made and Natural","content":"Miya Ando once told us “I think of myself as a person who works with light.” And light is certainly crucial in viewing her works. But take the modest statement with a grain of salt because, when creating her works, the part-artist, part-alchemist is usually armed with a breather mask, heavy gloves, a blow torch, sandpaper, grinders and a slew of pigments and chemicals that would make any chemistry teacher jealous. The petite Ando – some of the steel canvases she works with weigh more than she does – uses these tools to transform surfaces into subtle graduations of color that capture moments in time. Her new exhibition, titled Kisetsu (seasons in Japanese), are a series of paintings and installations that “are about finding harmony and balance between the man-made and natural.” Ando’s exhibition opens tomorrow at Sundaram Tagore in Chelsea (NYC) and will remain open through November 15, 2014.

The properties of the chemical then cause the objects to gradually transition from a solid to a gas, illustrating a fleeting and almost destructive sense of time. We wrote about her back in 2009 but she’s come a long way since and recently landed a site-specific installation at Liverpool Central Library’s Picton Reading Room. In collaboration with White Rainbow gallery Miyanaga created Strata, an ever-evolving series of objects like books and keys made from Napthalene. “Instead of disappearing into air, it is continuously crystallised through the conditions of temperature and humidity, and even the breath of the visitors.” These objects, constantly in flux, are contrasted with a series of cast naphthalene keys that are embedded in resin books and hence remain dormant, “waiting to be awakened.” The installation was on display last month in September. Here’s a statement from the press release: “Miyanaga’s work connects with a larger whole, a stage in the continuous cycle of the elements – it is an apparatus that asks us to pause, to look beyond the present and to wonder with serendipity.”","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["installation","science"],"date":"October 1, 2014"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Arata Endo: the architect who carried on Frank Lloyd Wright’s Legacy in Japan","content":"Famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright discovered Japan through the same method as many in his time: ukiyo-e prints. “I remember when I first met Japanese prints, I’ll never forget it,” Wright once said in a filmed interview. “Japanese art had a great influence on my feeling and thinking.” Wright first arrived in Japan in 1917 and that same year he met Arata Endo – 27 years old at the time and fresh off the team working on plans to construct Meiji Shrine. Like Wright, Endo had also risen to notoriety after publishing a scathing criticism of architect Kingo Tatsuno. The two architects bonded – both “had an infectious wit, no tolerance for mediocrity, and a belief in the sanctity of architecture” – and Wright hired Endo as chief draftsman on the Imperial Hotel project. As fate would have it, Okura & Co., whom Wright attributes as his first encounter with Japan 20 years earlier at the World’s Fair in Chicago, financed and built the hotel. However, ballooning costs for the Imperial Hotel project – it climbed to an extraordinary $3 million – put pressure on Wright. It’s unclear whether he was fired or resigned ( wikipedia states he was fired) but Wright left Japan and his primary protégé Endo oversaw the completion. Endo also continued to oversee projects that Wright had begun, like Jiyu Gakuen, the Tokyo school for girls, and the only surviving Frank Lloyd Wright residence in Japan: the Yodoko Guest House. As an architect and disciple of Wright, Endo can be easily criticized for never fully emerging from the shadow of Wright’s hegemony. His most important architectural contribution is, arguably, the Koshien Hotel, which was heavily influenced by Wright’s Imperial Hotel. Currently there is an accelerating revival movement to rediscover the work of Endo. This fall, for the first time ever, the Heritage Houses Trust is opening one of Endo’s private residences for public display . The Kaji Villa in Hayama was completed in 1928 and is significant in that Endo designed not only the home but the lighting and furniture as well. For a limited time only (October and November of 2014) the owner is allowing a public viewing.

Instead, he sources pigments found in local mud and sand, producing, what could very well be, the truest “site-specific” mural. We’ve followed him around the world – India, Tibet, Japan – where he’s created intricate, nature-inspired murals not only on the walls of galleries but in classrooms too. Now, for the first time, Asai’s work is on display at a gallery in the US: at Rice Gallery in Houston, Texas. Working with a team of assistants, Asai worked day and night – “sometimes working from 10 am to 3 or 5 in the morning” – for just under two weeks. He covered the walls and floors of the gallery with pigment made from soil that was collected locally. The final mural, titled “yamatane” (mountain seed), is a detailed world of dense landscape and imaginary creatures; “a living universe and ecosystem,” in Asai’s own words. “Dirt is by nature very different than materials sold in art stores,” says Asai, explaining why he chooses to work the way he does. “Seeds grow in it and it is home to many insects and micro organisms. It is a ‘living’ medium.” Yusuke Asai’s “yamatane” will be on view through November 23, 2014, at which point it will be washed away. But Asai accepts the ephemeral nature of dirt as medium. In fact, he embraces it: “Once dry, paint cannot be wiped away, but with the addition of water dirt can be removed from a surface,” he explains. “There is a desire for artwork to be permanent, but to try and keep it forever would mean that my painting would become unnatural.

It typically sits on a portable stove and people gather around it together, keeping warm and enjoying a nice hot meal. One evening in early December of last year, Masanori Kono , who works at a purikura company and runs a flea market in Nakameguro on weekends, decided to have a little fun and get creative with one of the ingredients: grated daikon radish. Kono sculpted the grated radish into the shape of a polar bear, added a bit of seaweed for eyes and nose and plopped him in the center of his pot. Coining his creation “Polar Bear Nabe,” he posted a picture to twitter, which quickly went viral. Shocked by its popularity, and surprised that no one had ever thought of this first, Kono decided to publish the recipe on CookPad . He also followed up on his creation with other variants that included panda bears, lambs and other white animals soaking in the hot bath. His online popularity has now landed him a book deal.

So to help raise awareness for condoms in Japan, and close the gap between producer and user, Japanese authorｓ Kyosuke Kagami and Opanpon have co-written a book that incorporates condoms into one of Japan’s most beloved customs: cooking. The new condom cookbook, which was just released today , is titled tsukutte agetai condomu gohan , which roughly translates as, “I want to cook condom food for you.” And to prove that this isn’t some elaborate prank, the authors have enlisted cuisine researcher Yuka Haruya to oversee production and ensure that all recipes are practical. The condom is, of course, utilized as a cooking tool, not an ingredient. The authors came up with 11 different recipes that utilize the condom’s durability and flexibility to create dishes that range from condom cookies and condom curry pilaf to condom oshi-zushi, which is featured on the front cover.

The White Rose English School will offer English lessons to preschoolers and elementary schoolers. The design for the new building, which just opened in April, came from female architect Naoko Horibe ( previously ), who turned to fast-food drive-thru systems for inspiration. Although drive-thru systems don’t conjure up the most favorable of imagery, it actually works quite well in this case. School buses and parents drive into the driveway and kids are dropped off under the school. This makes things easier on rainy days and it also keep the road from becoming congested during peak drop-off and pick-up times. “We set up two gateways which allowed cars to smoothly drive into the school premises and out, and also reducing the road congestion,” said Horibe. “The facade is designed with semicircles instead of complete circles, showing children’s potential in learning English.” But fast-food drive-thru systems aren’t the only thing that led Horibe to create her unique school. Located directly adjacent to the spot where the great Takatsuki Castle once stood, the site is steeped in 400 years of history.

To this day the land of the rising sun is still proud of its powerful auto, metal and glass industries. And no one is prouder than the City of Hamamatsu, “a major industrial hub based around textiles, musical instruments and transportation equipment.” City representatives describe Hamamatsu’s history : To commemorate this heritage, designer Yuma Kano created an installation of 36445 screws, screwed into a large board and installed at Mannenbashi Park Building where Design East was being held. The seemingly obscure number of screws actually indicates the number of businesses that operate in Hamamatsu, while the screws symbolize Japan’s industrial strength. Kano is actually the creator of a rather unique smiley face screw . For the installation he playfully hid just 1 of his smiley screws within the installation and challenged visitors to find it!

Yasuhiko Hayashi and Yusuke Nakano of Paramodel certainly do. Both born in the 70s, the duo began using the iconic toys as a basis for creating their sprawling installation art. And now their very first exhibition in the U.S. has opened. Hosted at the University of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA), “paramodelic-graffiti” is meticulously designed and crafted using Plarail tracks, toy cranes, small animal figurines and other artifacts of childhood to create a fantastical miniature world. Curator Natsu Oyobe explains that “There are many aspects of Paramodel’s work that resemble children’s play. In paramodelic-graffiti, the artists draw inspiration especially from the open-endedness of how children play—the way in which a block construction or a chalk drawing can infinitely expand as long as time, energy, and resources permit.” The exhibition is up through January 4, 2015 but if you can’t make it to the Museum you can check out more pictures on their flickr site .

Window House, constructed in 2013, is a modest – if ideally positioned – home in Kanagawa that sits on the edge of Sagami Bay. It’s tiny, even by Japanese standards, occupying a plot of land just 10 x 26 feet. The single-room home was designed for a single resident to be used as a weekend home. And, surprisingly, the thoughtful design is mindful not only of the client but of the surrounding neighbors. “It seemed difficult to avoid blocking the view of the neighborhood behind,” explains Yoshimura on his website, so he designed 2 large windows creating a see-through wall that doesn’t block views of the sea.

So when Japanese architects are given a wide lot on which to design a building, what’s more natural than dividing it into four narrow, vertical units? This is the basis for the unique project carried out by Be-Fun Design architects in Matsumaya, Ehime prefecture.  The idea driving the design of SPIRAL house was to create “a house where you can invite friends over” — something pretty unusual in Japan, where space is scarce and people value privacy more than elsewhere. The verticalness of the apartments is actually a clever solution to both of these constraints. It allows for a dedicated living room that is fully separated from the living quarters, protecting the privacy of the owners when guests are around. If you like the design — and don’t mind going up and down the stairway several times a day — a few units of the SPIRAL house  are actually available for rent from 48.000JPY (460USD).

The 33,000 sq ft building, shaded by a facade of woven wood strips, represents an extension to the institution’s current facilities. The glitzy city of Aspen, which boasts even its own reality TV series inspired by its wealthy, upper class demographic, might seem like an odd match for Ban, whose humanitarian practice has been called “an architectural iteration of Doctors Without Borders.” But Ban will be quick to point out that “many of the houses around here cost more” than $24 million museum. Unsurprisingly, the structure itself was inspired by Aspen’s breathtaking views and culture as a hub for skiing. Instead of entering on the street level and working your way up through the galleries, visitors climb an external staircase to arrive at a rooftop garden where they take in the views. From there they descend through the museum much like skiers climbing a ski lift, arriving on top and the skiing down. When asked if Ban had multiple designs for the Aspen museum, Ban said, “No… I only do one design… If I do three, obviously one is going to be the best. You’re only going to want the best, so I’m only going to show you one.” Where most museums, with their particular needs for climate and moisture controls, are notoriously energy inefficient,  Ban’s museum created many work-arounds that try to mitigate this. One is what the architects call “the thermos.” “The concept is to put the most demanding spaces at the center of the building and surround them with circulation space.

As hermit grabs grow they repeatedly swap the dwellings they’ve outgrown for bigger homes, tossing aside old ones for others to use. That’s why the Japanese name yadokari (宿借) is so much more appropriate. It literally means home borrower. But such behavior must surely be limited to animals. Or so thought Japanese artist Aki Inomata , who was surprised and inspired to learn that people, and countries, can behave in similar manners. Under a unique agreement between Japan and France, the land for the French Embassy in Tokyo changes hands between the two countries every several decades. “The same piece of land is peacefully transferred from one country to the other,” observed Inomata. And further exploring the idea of nationality, cross-border mobility and migration, the 31-year old artist, who often incorporates animals into her work, decided to craft 3D-printed hermit crab shells each architecturally modelled after different cities. Inomata then placed the empty shells into a cage and allowed the hermit crabs to pick and choose which one they wanted. “Though the body of the hermit crab is the same, according to the shell it is wearing, its appearance changes completely.

But even though their design is as simple as it gets, not everyone is able to use this standardized tool. This led Fukui-based craftsman Katsuyuki Miyabo to start using his woodworking skills to help people suffering hand disabilities. His chopsticks for the physically challenged are spring-operated and require minimal action to be used — their user simply presses on them to grab food, and they spring back in open position once the pressure is released. They also sport a custom-made, thick grip that lets its user get an intuitive, solid grip on the chopsticks. In the process of making each pair of sticks, Miyabi goes through a series of meetings and adjustments to make sure that the fit is perfect for each client. To save the cost and time of making new prototypes every time, the client usually starts out by choosing a base design, which Miyabi will refine using precise hand measurements to create an ergonomical shape. But most importantly, his face-to-face encounters allow him to gain insights into each client’s disability, understand how it affects them in his or her daily life and fuel his own motivation to keep going with the project.

In between its wings lay a man – an artist, inventor and operator of the glider – who gracefully floated his M-02J through the air by adjusting his body weight before landing it softly on the ground. The test flight was in preparation for the Summer Sky Fest 2014 , where, on July 27, hundreds of spectators would come to see numerous flying mobiles . However, the majority of visitors were there to see one thing: artist Kazuhiko Hachiya’s M-02J. And many of them were anime, rather than flight enthusiasts. Hachiya’s M-02J was modeled after the iconic jet glider Möwe flown by the protagonist and heroine of Hayao Miyazaki’s 1984 tour-de-force Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind . Nausicaa, a courageous spirit and a lover of nature, wind and sky, holds a special place in the hearts of those who grew up with Miyazaki’s films, or discovered them later in life. Hachiya too was a fan of Nausicaa and saw her uncanny rapport and devotion to all living things as a model for citizenship. In 2003, alleging that Iraq was in possession of weapons of mass destruction, the U.S. invaded Iraq and dragged Japan into their war. At the time, Hachiya saw many parallels between the current situation and Miyazaki’s film, which tells the story of a peaceful town that gets dragged into conflict between warring nations. “I couldn’t believe the Japanese government was participating in this war,” recalls Hachiya in an interview . “If Nausicaa was our prime minister she would never do that.” Quixotic? Dreamy? Perhaps. But it was those thoughts that led to Hachiya to turn fiction into reality. It took him 10 years and 4 prototypes but he finally developed M-02J. “I’m not Nausicaa,” he says, but at least I can try to create her jet glider as a symbol of peace.","post_categories":["Industrial Design"],"post_tags":["Ghibli"],"date":"July 29, 2014"},{"author":"Ginisty Gauthier","title":"Diorama artist creates miniature worlds from everyday objects","content":"  Making simple train replicas was not enough for Japan-based model artist Akihiro Morohoshi .

It was, you might say, a most un-American party with platters of sushi, vinegar-seasoned rice, vegetables simmered in sweet soy sauce and a dizzying array of Japanese beers and sake. But the most memorable fixture was an elaborate nagashi-somen contraption. It had been fashioned out of several pieces of interlocking bamboo chutes that were cut in half to create aqueducts. A water pump allowed for a continuous flow, which, much like a water slide, carried cold noodles as they zipped through and down the bamboo chutes.   The contraption had been designed and hand-made by the host of the party, Makoto Aoki . And as it turns out, Aoki makes it his business to build such mechanisms, often with the water pumps but without the noodles. Aoki, who leads the Brooklyn-based firm Swell, specializes in model-making and special effects for print ads, TV commercials and films. When PepsiCo needed to create a Mountain Dew ad, Aoki was called upon by the photographer to rig a contraption that would spew the beverage (actually green-tinted water) through the cracks of the bottle.  When Pringles wanted a tower of chips that appeared to be karate-chopped in half, Aoki went through boxes of Pringles, sorting the nicely shaped chips and gluing them together. When Money Magazine wanted a shiny dollar-sign-puzzle-piece to grace the cover of their magazine, they turned to Swell.

There, under the direction of Hirotsugu Aoki, the special effects director on Back To The Future, the younger Aoki learned the intricate craft of model-making and special effects rigging. “I was basically a servant boy,” jokes Aoki. “I was doing all sorts of odd and ends for like $100 a week.”   And although Aoki went off on his own, and now employes anywhere from 3-6 freelancers at a time, his job description hasn’t changed all that much. His hands-on approach has him involved at every stage of the process from idea sketches to delivering the final product to the photographer or ad firm. That’s also part of the reason why he has gained an impressive roster of faithful clients. Swell has recently added CGI to their list of offerings but for the most part models and props are all made by hand. And Aoki doesn’t see this changing anytime soon. Despite advancements in computer graphics, there’s an authenticity and beauty that’s only achieved by shooting real things, especially if they are miniature models or enlarged props. And as it turns out, there’s a reason why he’s based in New York and not Japan. “There really isn’t much demand for this type of work in Japan,” explains Aoki. The country has tendency to use celebrities in ads, rather than models. “It’s a very different culture.”  Aoki approaches each project with the same methodical precision and accuracy. Which is why he struggles with questions like, “what was the most difficult?” Although each project is unique and different, through a calculated process of reverse engineering Aoki manages to churn out each project within several days. And there’s a certain Japaneseness to his work ethic.  “I try to exceed expectations of the client,” he says. Sometimes that means creating multiple versions of each order in case the client has a change of mind.       “What was your most successful project?” is another question that Aoki struggles with. But it’s not just his methodical approach to his work that obstructs an answer. Aoki doesn’t often receive feedback, nor does he bother asking for it. But when pressed, he told us that a project he did for Guinness in 2012 was probably up there. “We don’t get to travel much in our line of work” but for this project the team took their models to Olympic Park in Washington. They were staged and shot by photographer Nadav Kander. As a result, there was almost no post-production wizardry that needed to happen.     As usual, Huey (7) had a few questions for Makoto. Makoto was kind enough to offer a recent model he creating to 1 lucky reader: a fake Dove soap bar that was used in a commercial (“we never use real soap because the bubbles don’t stick to it properly”).

But what if we gave similar attributes to letters like B or N which are never used as expression forms?” The result, as you can see is a disturbingly realistic serious of mouths, lips, teeth and tongues, all hand-crafted from clay and mounted to a wooden frame.

On a recent TV show that aired June 30, 2014, cameras followed Matsumoto and documented one of his “classes.” He was teaching the 2000-year old logographic characters known as Kanji, which make up Japan’s writing system. But as Matsumoto showed, with deft and humor, they don’t just represent words. Upon closer observation they’re infused with values and wisdom passed down from our ancient ancestors. You can watch the full clip above but I’ve translated and summarized a few of Matsumoto’s primary examples:  逃  to run away  the kanji is made up from the radicals 辶 (meaning road or path) and 兆 (meaning dawn, horizon or sign of change). If you’re scared or sense danger it’s ok to run away. It’s ok to change course. Your destination remains the same but you’re just taking a different path to get there. 幸 and 辛  fortunate and painful  The two kanji are very similar. The addition of just 1 line turns pain into fortune. If there’s something missing in your life you’re in pain. But once you find it you’ll be fortunate. 吐  to spew (negative thoughts or words)  the kanji is made up of the radical口 (mouth) and the ± (plus/minus symbol). When something goes wrong and you’re in pain you think negative thoughts; you say negative things. But those who succeed are those who manage to stop thinking negatively. Once you remove the minus symbol from the kanji you get叶(to come true, as in dreams or aspirations). 難  difficulty  A life without difficulty is a life not worth living. When you combine the kanji 無 (none) with 難(difficulty) you get 無難 (not interesting, stimulating, or significant). But when you combine the kanji 有 (to have) with難(difficulty) you get 有難 (blessed) because without difficulties how do you appreciate life? : 命  life  the kanji is made up of the radicals 人 (person), 一 (one) and 叩 (hit or beat). This is life. When you’re asleep or when you’re awake, that one beat – your heart – over and over again, is all that sustains life. 始  beginning  the beginning of all life comes from women; from your mother. The kanji for beginning is made up of the radicals 女 (woman) and 台 (platform or foundation). The foundation of life are women. And your mother risked her life to bring you into this world. Treasure your mother. And when you get out of here, get back to living your life.","post_categories":["Interactive/ Technology"],"post_tags":["kanji","TV show"],"date":"July 9, 2014"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"WORK WORK SHOP | a new experimental workplace in Tokyo","content":"“Today is the future,” says the ifs future laboratory , an initiative started last year by itochu fashion system (ifs).

In a country where the female anatomy is “overly hidden,” she “did not know what a pussy should look like.” In order to demystify the vagina, Igarashi has embarked upon various other artworks she calls “Deco-Man.” “Man,” is short for the Japanese word that equates to vagina (manko) while “deco” is an abbreviation of “decorated.” “The goal is to make “pussy more casual and pop.”","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["3D printing","Megumi Igarashi","nsfw","penis","vagina"],"date":"July 14, 2014"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Motion Silhouette | a storybook of light and shadows","content":"Motion Silhouette is a fascinating little storybook designed by 25-year old designers Megumi Kajiwara and Tatsuhiko Niijima.

When you think about it – and it’s evident that Tamai has done plenty of that – a painting, on a microscopic scale, is just multitudes of fibers stained with ink. And that’s how Tamai approaches her canvas: in pursuit of “the finest lines that are the smallest unit of painting.” And it’s not just any type of paper that Tamai is deconstructing. “This is the world’s thinnest handmade paper,” she told us recently, holding up a delicate piece of washi paper that looked like it was about to burn off like morning fog. We were standing in her makeshift studio at the Japan Society in Manhattan where Tamai is in the midst of a summer residency program. The paper was the work of another artist, a Japanese Living National Treasure, actually, named Sazio Hamada. “I consider my work a collaboration between myself and Hamada-san,” she told us. Cyoko Tamai was born in Kochi Prefecture and grew up in a family of music-lovers. Both her brother and sister played an instrument. So when Tamai went to college she enrolled in Tokyo University’s Department of Musical Creativity and Environment, which combined one of her other passions: film. “I really loved movies, especially the old black and white films of Hiroshi Inagaki,Keisuke Kinoshita and Mikio Naruse.” Actually, It’s not too much of a stretch to see the connection that black & white films had on Tamai current love for white paper and black ink. However, making music was not where Tamai would end up. “I was always interested in visualizing the invisible,” says Tamai, explaining how she transitioned from music to painting. After obtaining her BFA she pursued an MFA in Japanese Painting, from which she just graduated this year. Cyoko is currently working a several smaller works – she she committed to completing one a day – and a larger scroll, all of which will be showcased at the end of her residency program. There is an upcoming open studio event this Saturday (July 19, 2014) where anyone can go visit her and see her work. Tamai describes a rather coincidental discovery in which she learned of a legendary craftsman in her hometown of Kochi. It was Sazio Hamada who, in 2001, was declared living national treasure for his skilled craftsmanship in creating Japanese washi paper. ( Here’s a video of the grandson, who has now taken over, demonstrating the craft) She decided to make a pilgrimage down to visit Sazio Hamada. “I showed him my work and he was like, ‘why don’t you try using this’ and he handed me a big wad of paper. That was when I first started using his paper.” I was surprised to learn that Tamai approaches each blank canvas with an equally blank state of mind. She has no preconceived ideas as to how the piece will turn. But once she sits down and begins picking away it’s as if she’s entered a trance-like state. Her body is at ease but the process is a violent one, reminiscent of a tattoo artist rupturing the skin with needle and ink. As she picks away, one is keenly aware of constant, steady beat created by her pen. The pen moves around her canvas. Sometimes she is doing the moving while other times she rotates the canvas. It was an odd scene to observe and one that begged the question, “how do you know when your finished?” Tamai pondered this for a moment and then replied, “I just sort of know. It’s like the music suddenly stops.”","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["Japan Society","painting","sumi"],"date":"July 15, 2014"},{"author":"Maddie","title":"Our Favorite Japan-Related Instagram Accounts to Follow","content":"@instagramjapan These days I find myself clicking on link after link and # after# on Instagram , losing complete track of time.

These are all ingredients for an awesome party but not something you would find in an office or cubicle. Unless of course you’re talking about “Desktop Fireworks,” a series of fun lights and noisemakers concealed as ordinary stationary supplies you would find on a desk. Conceived by UK-based Japanese designer Tomomi Sayuda , the party is only activated by pressing the big emergency style button, which releases an orchestra of light, music, bubbles, confetti and thus relieves stress at the workplace. “The button should only be pressed at times of extreme stress,” warns Sayuda. Although seemingly all fun and games, the project actually presents a dark cautionary tale. “This is dedicated to my father Kenichi Sayuda, who committed suicide on 8th July 1995 – aged 37, due to his stress at work,” says Sayuda. Japan is perhaps one of the only countries that has a specific word for occupational death – karoshi (過労死) is literally “death from overwork” while karojisatsu (過労自殺) is “suicide from overwork” – and is also one of the few that has the need to report it in statistics as a separate category. According to government data ( PDF ), in 2012 there were 285 reported deaths in Japan attributed to overwork. This actually represented the first decline in 3 years after rising to a peak of 302 in 2011.

It’s a simple question with a seemingly simple answer. But how do you prove that a single drop of water, when accumulated by the millions, will actually sound like rain? Digital mastermind Yugo Nakamura ( previously ) set out to prove this in a video titled “ Amaoto no Yurai ,” or The Origin of The Sound of Rain. The designer set out by recording the sound and motion of water drops falling on different objects – everything from soil, rock, tree and leaf to brick and skin. As expected, each sound was unique and didn’t even come close to what we recognize as the sound of rain. But when the sounds were combined – first 2-fold, then 4-fold and exponentially larger – the result seems to speak for itself. But be your own judge and have a listen.

The exhibition, which took place in Shibuya’s Hikarie last month, featured buildings by four architectural firms from Japan: Shuhei Endo,  Ippei Takahashi, Murayama + Kato Architecture and Kentaro Ishida.   But in addition to your traditional scaled models of homes, the architects asked various artists to create works of art inspired by the homes. The artworks helped us see a new side of architecture and opened the door for a new type of viewing, explained participating architects Murayama and Kato.

However, what if the paper itself became the table? What if we were suddenly allowed to scribble on tables and floors? This is essentially the idea that Kobe Ishou Sourenjo (神戸意匠操練所), a group of 3 young designers, came up with. The genius of Roll Table lies in its ability to transform a roll of paper into an actual drawing table. I know it sounds simple, but indulge me. While many art easels come with a roll of paper, it’s hidden from sight. By bringing it to the foreground and making the infinite qualities of a roll of paper more salient and perceptible – not to mention interactive! – Roll Paper manages to imbed a new dynamic into the act of drawing.

But its evolution became particularly pronounced relatively recently with the introduction of formal schooling, which allowed for the establishment of the common trope we have come to know as the school girl. Modern printing technology also allowed for the creation and dissemination of various print magazines, which took it upon themselves to define what it meant for women to be beautiful. But, in particular, what have the Japanese required in depictions of beauty, and how did we go from bijinga (beautiful women) in the Edo period to bishojo (beautiful young girls) today? That question, and many others, is the subject of a new exhibition at the Aomori Museum of Art . “ Bishojo: Young Pretty Girls in Art History ” will run from July 7 – September 7, 2014 and will feature more than 300 works that span over 300 years, all categorized under various sub-themes like “musical girls” and “magical girls” to “girls having fun.” Works shown below are samples that aren’t necessarily part of the exhibition. The eastern counterpart of Girls Gone Wild? Not exactly. The bishojo motif is first thought to have begun during the “Early Modern Genre-Painting” when young girls were depicted having fun and generally enjoying life. The motif has continued to live on today. It’s around the early 1900 when the beauty of cherubic innocence and purity begins to take on as prominent imagery in art. We also begin to see a cuteness emerge that is reminiscent of what we have come to understand today as “kawaii.” A popular game that emerged in the late 1800s to early 1900s was sugoroku, a board game that featured illustrations that players had to traverse by rolling dice. A common genre were illustrations that featured young girls in various moments of their life: playing, going to school and other day-to-day activities. Sugoroku was often included as a freebie that came with magazines. If formal schooling allowed for the creation of the shojo and schoolgirl trope then it was shojo magazines – beginning with the pioneering Shojokai, which began publishing in 1902 – that was steering the imagery. The schoolgirl image, which has been nurtured since the early 1900s, begins to change in a post-war Japan. A look at another common theme in Japanese painting: young girls depicted along in intimate settings like their room or yard. Music and spirituality have always shared a tight bond. So it’s not surprising that the girls interacting with music is another common motif found in art history. And following it leads to one of Japan’s most recent art/musical hybrid sensation: Hatsune Miku. The 16-year old popstar who never ages and is never caught up in drugs, alcohol or any other scandal because she’s a digital avatar. Before they dressed up as anime characters, costume play (or cosplay) was much more reserved. Artists would depict their subjects wearing intricate patterns or acting out a certain job. Active, strong and resilient girls are a trope that appeared relatively recently. They’re brave, kind and have strengths that aren’t always evident. But they’re also risk takers that appear to be more complex than their male hero counterparts. Perhaps in reaction to the many depictions of young girls offering comfort and pleasure, there appeared those who suffered from pain that wasn’t clearly evident on the surface. They began to appear in the girl magazines and quickly garnered support from those who shared in their pain.","post_categories":["Go and See"],"post_tags":["Anime","girls","history","kawaii","manga","schoolgirls","tezuka osamu"],"date":"June 24, 2014"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Takashi Murakami Responds To Sexist Heckling With Portraits of Ayaka Shiomura","content":"In case you haven’t heard, all of Japan has been embroiled in a political scandal since last week when assemblywoman But in a swift and hasty move now Takashi Murakami, perhaps one of Japan’s most well-known artists, is throwing in his two-cents.

The country lost 244,000 people in 2013 and faces the prospect of losing an entire third of their population in the next 50 years. But instead of the simple solution, which is to allow perfectly capable nurses and other workers to enter the country, Japan has, instead, elected to spend billions of yen and decades of research trying to perfect humanoid robots that will one day replace Japan’s shrinking workforce. But why? Many will attribute Japan’s enthusiasm towards robots to a systemic xenophobia, coupled with non-robophobia. While the typical Western science fiction plot involving robots has them developing rebellious, sinister tendencies, Japanese robots (Tetsuwan Atomu or Doraemon) are usually portrayed as helpful, friendly and benign. British photographer Luisa Whitton recent spent several months in Japan, shadowing Hiroshi Ishiguro, a high-profile professor and director of the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory . Her resulting photo series “What About The Heart?” documents Japan’s rapidly progressing humanoid robotics industry. As the title suggests, it presents the future faces of technology while asking, “what does it mean to be human as technology progresses?” Whitton’s photos are uncanny as they are, but, but made even more unsettling by the blaring omission of any actual humans in the photos. Interestingly, in 1970 a Japanese robotics engineer named Masahiro Mori published a paper called “The Uncanny Valley.” In it he argues that we will accept a synthetic human that looks and moves realistically, but only up to a point; our satisfaction drops precipitately once the resemblance becomes close enough to nearly – but not quite – fool us.

Blue jeans and white T-shirts. Cartoons and Saturday mornings. Matsumoto and Hamada. And, of course, there are traditional Japanese food pairings. At long last, scientists have gotten around to confirming what countless generations of Japanese chefs and chowhounds have known in their guts to be true: certain dishes, like our personal favorite beer and edamame, are just plain meant to be. (Even molecularly.) Read on as we serve up the new science behind some of the oldest Japanese food combinations. No pairing in Japanese cuisine, perhaps, is as famous as sushi and its loyal sidekick, wasabi. Not only does wasabi pack a mighty wallop for your taste buds, but it also serves as a powerful anti-microbial agent, making it a perfect partner for raw fish.  But, hey, sometimes you need your fish well done. Blackened even–like the traditional platter of chargrilled . If so, it’s best not to skimp on the customary side of diced daikon radish. Cancer-fighting glucosinolates in the daikon work to counter the carcinogens in the charred part of the fish. And the daikon is really tasty.  You’re probably thinking: the seaweed wrapped around my onigiri already acts as an exceedingly convenient method of conveying sticky rice to my mouth. What more can I ask of this–this superfood? Actually, a lot. It turns out that this wrap, called a laver, holds the amount of Vitamin B necessary to convert all those rice-born carbohydrates into energy. Fuel for thought.  The next time you’re tempted to bypass that heap of cabbage on your plate and go directly to those tender, golden strips: don’t. Raw cabbage excels at delivering the little-known Vitamin U. This (slightly mysterious sounding) compound protects against a whole host of tummy-aching disorders, including acid reflux. The important lesson here: cabbage will allow you to eat more delicious meat.  Let’s hope you took that cabbage advice, because our next combo is also a meat-heavy one–pork-curry and pickled shallots. Pork is loaded with B1, a vitamin essential to maintaining regular cellular function. Shallots burst with the amino acid allysine, which promotes absorption of B1.

But in order to make his models accurate he needed drawings or photographs of the areas that once served as post-war Japan’s industrial engine. Faced with high fences and no trespassing signs, Iwasaki decide to take matters into his own hands. Or rather, Google’s hands. Going onto Google Earth, he sourced all the satellite images he needed to recreate old oil refineries, natural gas generators and gantry cranes. Using cloth fibers, human hair and dust Iwasaki assembled his cityscapes which, he admits, were inspired by Katsuhiro Otomo ’s background imagery. But why does he insist on using limited resources? At an artist talk at the museum Iwasaki revealed that he was moved by a well-known story about Sesshu (1333 – 1573), a celebrated Japanese ink painter. As legend goes, young Sesshu was studying to become a Zen monk. One day his master punishes him for ignoring his training and, instead, being preoccupied with painting. He ties Sesshu to a pillar but when he comes back to check on him he finds a large mouse at Sesshu’s feet. Afraid that Sesshu will be bitten, the priest runs over to shoo the mouse away. But when he arrives he’s astounded to find that it’s a unbelievably realistic painting drawn by Sesshu using his toe as brush and tears as paint. From that day on Sesshu is never discouraged to paint ever again. [06/17/2016] it was announced that Iwasaki was selected to represent Japan at the 2017 Venice Biennial. He will present a series of new works based on his “Out of Disorder” series.

Tokyo city dwellers will often travel all the way to Kyoto just to sample the revered gardens housed within local shrines. Another source of relaxation – enjoying Japanese sweets – doesn’t necessarily go hand-in-hand with rock gardens. But combining these two modern-day pleasures in an elegant design is the Shinan-ji Temple Rock Garden. Named after a fictional temple, the miniature rock garden is actually made from entirely edible ingredients that include black sesame cubes (shaped like rocks) and a bed of sugar (resembling sand). The unique collaboration is the work of art directors Tomonori Saito and Shohei Sawada, who enlisted Japanese artisan Motohiro Inaba to help make their sweet garden a reality.

It’s actually one of the few places which are funded to do this. Other galleries are often seeking fresh talent but many artists still struggle to produce work and often have full or part time day jobs. Boasting three centrally located spaces (Shibuya, TWS Residency and Hongo) it also runs residencies, organizes symposiums and is an all round good egg of the Japanese art scene. The current show Tokyo Story 2014 ends June 8 and is part one of a two part concept rousing on artists responses to Japanese identity. To briefly summarize, 6 artists occupy 3 floors in a kind of pyramid. Floor one is a hotchpotch of installation and documentation and features the work of three of the six, Ichiro Endo , Chikara Matsumoto and Daisuke Nagaoka . The top is the focal point and features only the work of Yoshihiro Yamamoto (photographs and a delicate and heart breaking video work about Fukushima). The middle features two artist Saiko T. Kase and Mamoru Okuno . I want to focus on his work. I met Mamoru in 2007 at Bank Art space in Yokohama. I later found out more biographical detail (he had studied music in the U.S. before switching to “sound art” due to a tendon problem). His early work sampled sounds, looped them, re-integrated them into performances that combined the immediacy of the voice with the notion of sound physically resonating within space so that pre-recorded moments could simultaneously exist within a new space, functioning much like memory. Over the years his work developed and his numerous performances in gallery and non gallery spaces utilized everyday materials such as straws, (cup) noodles, tea, coffee. Some might say his work has a Japanese sensibility in that it is stripping the moment of the unnecessary to draw attention to what is there but his sensibility is one of space and sound.  Sounds of plastic wrapping, of coat hangers, of people sharing an experience. This idea has been developing and deepening and the current work “ ” (the 4th Movement; 19 June 1874) which is a delicate synthesis of multiple elements – the musician and his musical score, the actor and his stage for performance, the reader and his created world. The piece is based on extensive research of the work of B.S. Lyman, an American geologist employed in the Meiji period by the Japanese government to survey Hokkaido (then called Yesso/Ezo). He found that it was rich in coal, a fact that, along with silk, helped form part of Japan’s major industrial exports. Mamoru poses the rhetorical question: “Is it possible to hear a sound that one has never heard before?” His piece, The 4th Movement, is based on a seminal scene in which Lyman finds coal pebbles on a sandy beach of the River Yubari. Entering the slightly darkened space you see an empty stand, to your right is a framed geological map, to your left some text, and a small shelf. The walls are black, on the floor in the shape of the map are color copies of an old journal. Sitting on the shelf are two musical scores, one written in Japanese, one English and a compass. Your are instructed to place the score on the stand. You read and as you read you imagine the sounds. The act of reading is something we do without thinking, reading it as a “score” in this way brings a heightened awareness of both the act of reading and the sounds which you imagine. The whole work is a synthesis of the notion of evocation and poses a question – where do we actually “hear” sound? Is it the vibrations of the air, or is it within our brains as we “receive” this external sound. Looking at this work I was reminded of reading a poem, reading a letter, researching an essay, performing at a concert. The presentation itself is understated not showy but the work, like the story of Lyman leaves a viewer/listener/reader with much to ponder about Japan and about the nature of perception.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["Hokkaido","old japan","sound","tokyo guide art shows"],"date":"May 30, 2014"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Sprouting Life in the Forest | A New Classroom Mural Painted in India by Yusuke Asai","content":"After creating his sprawling mural for the Niranjana School in Bahar, east India, back in 2011, the Wall Art Festival invited Yusuke Asai back to India for another project.

After decades of untrammeled expansion in their home market, Japanese bicycle makers set their steely sights on an even bigger prize: American roadways. Starting with the introduction of Nichibei Fuji’s S10-S model in 1971, Japanese bike manufacturers rushed to meet a historic spike in America’s demand for road bikes. The big makers, with names both still relevant and lost to time, included the aforementioned Fuji, Miyata, Nishiki, Bridgestone, and even Panasonic. Yes, that Panasonic. Japanese bikes garnered glowing reviews for their innovation, construction, and competitive pricing–Fuji even managed to snag first place in Consumer Reports Magazine three times in their first decade in America. (Full disclosure: we would have given it to them too, if only because they had a model called “Fuji’s The Ace.”) At the height of the 1970s bike-mania, Japanese manufacturers exported about a million bikes to the States per year.  The 80s ended all that. In the middle of the decade, fluctuating currency rates and a shift in taste towards mountain bikes conspired to end the era of Japanese racers. Many of the American subsidiaries declared bankruptcy and shuttered operations. But, if the presence of these enthusiasts shows anything, it’s that, in some places, Japanese bike-mania rides on. images: flickr , Panasonic Bike Virtual Museum , Classic Fuji Bike Museum","post_categories":["Industrial Design"],"post_tags":["Bicycle","fuji","panasonic"],"date":"May 16, 2014"},{"author":"Ginisty Gauthier","title":"The Most Comfy Cup of Tea | Texture Cups by Cement Design","content":"s you drink your tea or coffee, you may feel the touch of Japanese craftsmanship along with the cup’s unique texture.

Even by the 1920s the bicycle in Japan had achieved ubiquitous status with the government, in 1927, declaring November 11 to be “Bicycle Commemoration Day.” At the time, government officials noted that Japan had become “the foremost bicycle riding country in the world.” And while the bicycle itself has evolved, its status as a mainstay has little changed. Recent reports indicate penetration to be at 1 bicycle for every 1.5 people, one of the highest in the world. Residents and visitors will agree that the bicycle is one of the best ways to get around dense cities like Tokyo. As I wrote over in Design Made In Japan , now a new organization is looking to change the way we get around. Calling themselves the Walking Bicycle Club , a group of designers have debuted a piece of equipment called the walking bicycle (we’ll call it WB for short). Not unlike an air walker you might see at a gym, the WB – “the world’s first,” claim the inventors – can achieve speeds of a normal bicycle simply by moving your legs the way you would walk. And it’s classified as a bicycle, which means you don’t need a license and it can be used on all the same roads as bikes. It’s a nice medium for those who like to walk, but also need to cover significant distance.  The WB also comes with an impressive pedigree. It was designed by Shuwa Tei , an architect and designer known for works like HOTEL CLASKA and United Cinemas Toyosu. Accompanying him is Kenya Hara , the man behind the MUJI aesthetic. And it’s manufactured by Katayama Industries, a key player in the global bicycle parts industry. But will the WB have legs? It’s hard to say but at a price point of 290,000 yen (about $2900), it’s also hard to see it having mass-market appeal.

Many of his photographs were hand-colored, which is why they appear more realistic and modern than the black and white photos. This photo above is actually one of my favorites.

The architect, who won the Pritzker Prize in 1995, constructs his buildings almost entirely from concrete. But don’t call him a minimalist. Ando creates subtle compositions of masses and planes that play against light and, often, against natural elements like water and plants. The self-taught architect had a stint as a professional boxer, which may account for the intense physicality of his buildings. But when a wealthy family in Monterrey, Mexico asked Ando to design a family home for them – they first had to go through the Japanese embassy in Mexico to reach him – the Japanese architect was hesitant. Despite a huge cement industry, “there was no company in Mexico that could match the quality Ando would expect,” admitted the client. But perhaps William Burroughs was on to something when we wrote that “in Mexico your wishes have a dream power. When you want to see someone, he turns up.” In the end, the family managed to woo Ando to Mexico on one condition: that two experts on cement be brought from Japan to train workers, and that a new construction and cement company would be formed. In early 2011 “House in Monterrey” – Ando’s first residential project in Mexico – was completed. The sprawling 4,900 sq-ft home, wedged into a mountain slope, looks like a little slice of heaven. It sits almost 3000 ft above sea level and looks out on the Sierra Las Mitras mountains. Amongst other luxuries, the home boasts a cantilevered infinity pool, a double-height library, a wine cellar, gym and, of course, a gallery. But Ando didn’t let his new import end at just one residential home. Early last year he completed “Gate of Creation,” a monolithic structure that is now home to the University of Monterrey, Mexico’s art, design and architecture department. The six-story concrete block, which features a huge triangular void at its center, was not without public controversy. Several critics were upset that a Japanese architect had been chosen to design a building that, in fact, celebrates the existence and vitality of Mexican design. But the building stands and, apparently, has left more than another Ando-designed masterpiece in the region. “this building has elevated the quality of the construction industry in the whole region,” says a local architect who worked with Ando. “safety standards have been raised, contractors’ bidding has become more detailed and precise and, of course, knowhow of high-quality concrete was increased.”","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["architecture-residential","Concrete","mexico","tadao ando"],"date":"May 23, 2014"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"The Snapshot Photography of Muga Miyahara","content":"Twenty three years ago the photographer Muga Miyahara began taking snapshots of people, places and friends.

The “ Tunnel House ,” as it was aptly named, was designed by Makiko Tsukada , a 53-year old female architect, who created the cavernous space for a couple and their three cats. But something tells me the cats are getting more use out of it than the humans. The tunnel begins right at the street, where a carved out section of the home forms a parking lot. The tunnel then extends throughout the home, dividing and linking spaces with openings that lead into the bathroom and bedroom, as well as a small courtyard. A pair of stairs – one which actually brings you on top of the tunnel – leads to a 2nd floor dining room and kitchen. “There’s a certain feeling of comfort one gets by walking through this space,” says the architect. Well, I’m not sure about comfort but it would certainly keep the day interesting.

But 38-year old architect Kentaro Yamazaki ( previously ) will tell you, without shame or resignation, that his latest creation is an “unfinished house.” Located roughly 1 hour outside Tokyo, in the residential suburb of Kashiwa, is a home for a growing family. The design of the home is pretty straightforward: surrounding a central hub are “4 boxes, each box divided into 2 layers,” describes Yamazaki. The first layer of each box has a functional use like a kitchen, bathroom or office. But the second layer has intentionally been left blank, or unfinished, to allow the residents to create their own space.“Particularly the children’s room should be left up to the child to design.” Something else that’s also been left out – intentionally, I might point out – are the very fabric of modern-day families: walls. As the pictures adequately portray, each “box” is left exposed so that the entire space is, in effect, connected. In a way, it’s a return to the shared living concept of several hundred years ago when family members all roomed together. It’s a beautiful house with a free space, but is it too free? It’s not a stretch to imagine some pretty awkward moments, especially if you have kids who are growing up. It certainly gives new meaning to “no secrets.”","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["architecture-residential","privacy","yamazaki kentaro"],"date":"May 5, 2014"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Do Not Kill | a brief history of the korosuna Japanese anti-war ads","content":"Over the weekend a bold, 2-page spread appeared in the Asahi Newspaper, a politically leftist publication and second largest behind the more conservative Yomiuri. Amongst a typographic sea of colorful words rose the letters – all in black – (殺すな, do not kill). The letters themselves, revealed by a closer look, are comprised of the names of everyone supporting the message. It was a stunning ad, albeit rather audacious, and, unsurprisingly, seemed to offend many of Japan’s netizens. It was as if a rock had been thrown at their window, shattering glass into their peaceful world. The ad had been paid for by two  organizations , both run by anti-war activists, and timed to run on Constitution Day. On the left in bold reads “Our responsibility for the future. Maintain Article 9.” On the opposite side: “The right to collective self-defense is the path to war.” It was in protest of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe being increasingly bent on altering the pacifist Constitution. But the ad wasn’t new. It’s roots can be traced back to 2003 when a similar ad ran in the Mainichi Shinbun to protest the Iraq war, and Japan’s involvement in it. In both cases it appears that the magnificent layout was the work of graphic designer Suzuki Hitoshi. However, to trace it back to its origins we have to travel back almost 50 years to the lobby of the Tokyu Hotel in Ginza where, on a cold winter night in January of 1967, a group of people sat around a table discussing a potential ad that would run in the Washington Post. Amongst the group was the historian and philosopher Shunsuke Tsurumi , the composer Rokusuke Ei and artist Taro Okamoto , all members of Beheiren . Despite the target audience being predominantly English speakers, it was Tsurumi who came up with the idea of having Okamoto draw korosuna in Japanese characters as an attention-grabber. Okamoto immediately agreed and quickly drafted up a design. Three months later the conspicuous full-page ad ran in the Washington Post. It took another 6 years for the Vietnam War to come to an end and, with it, the disbandment of Beheiren. But it’s fascinating to me that a word, and it’s powerful message, has lived on. For those willing to see the word (殺すな, do not kill) for what it is, accepting the violence it denounces, will gain a deep understanding of Japan’s history.","post_categories":["Graphic Design"],"post_tags":["activism","history","okamoto taro","political","typography","violence","war"],"date":"May 6, 2014"},{"author":"rachel carvosso","title":"down side up | the calligraphy of artist Shoko Kanazawa","content":"Interested in calligraphy and outsider art?

Founded in 1993 by Sandy Smith but taken over by former art dealer Andrew Edlin of Wide Open Arts, it builds on the idea of Art Brut (Raw Art) a movement formalised in 1947 by Jean Debuffet. Born with Down Syndrome, Kanazawa’s talent was discovered aged five, when her mother Yasuko, herself a calligraphy student and later teacher, started teaching her at home. Nurturing her daughter’s talent with encouragement and training, by the time Kanazawa was a young adult she had progressed to exhibiting in temples in Kyoto (Kenninji), Kamakura (Kenchoji) and Nara (Todaiji). In 2011 Japanese TV giant NHK commissioned her to create the opening titles for their primetime 2012 historical drama “Taira no Kiyomori”. Her work is often large scale with distinctive bold brushstrokes and her live demonstrations draw wide crowds in Japan. Joining this four day festival allows a unique chance for fans of Japanese culture and those interested in outsider art to experience her works.

The structure itself is quite simple – a study in minimalism – but it’s the details that expose the workplace to the outdoors. Various plant life were carefully chosen for the interior based on functional criteria – vegetation for shielding the sun, flowers to exude aromas and herbs for cooking. After the studio’s completion in early 2011, Fujino set up a camera in the office to record daily life of staff, the growth of all his office plants and how the two interact. Exactly 3 years since the completion of his office, Fujino has compiled a time-lapse of the video.

When it comes to reinventing the world’s favorite sweet, Japan does it best. From planetary chocolates to a chocolate-filled paint set, here are our favorite creative innovations using chocolate. Nendo created “ Chocolatexture ” a series of 9 chocolates, all the same size, but each representing a Japanese onomatopoeic word that describes texture.  Japanese illustrator and designer Akihiro Mizuuchi decided to do something special for loved ones. He created his own chocolate LEGO bricks and then built chocolate LEGO teddy bears with them. Now that’s love!   Last year Fab Café in Shibuya held a workshop where participants – using a 3D scanner and printer – created a chocolate replica of their own face. If you’re heading to Tokyo’s latest landmark, Tokyo Sky Tree, you’ll also have a chance to satisfy both your sweet tooth and your design tooth by making a pit-stop at 100% Chocolate Café . The cafe features an open kitchen that would make even Willy Wonka proud. Visitors can watch the process of sweets being made through a display of glazed boxes containing ingredients of 56 different types of chocolate. Combining astronomy and good eats sounds too good to be true. But the Righa Royal Hotel sells a chocolaty solar system that includes Mercury (coconut mango), Venus (cream lemon), Earth (cacao), Mars (orange praline), Jupiter (vanilla), Saturn (rum raisin), Uranus (milk tea) and Neptune (capuccino) – sorry, pluto is no longer considered a planet. For the inner-artist in all of us, design studio Nendo created this entirely edible set of chocolate oil paints. The limited edition paint tubes, created in collaboration with lifestyle magazine PEN last year, are made from chocolate while the insides are replaced by various syrups. Rewind several years and you’ll find a somewhat-similar project in which the designer created a set of chocolate-shaped pencils. They were commissioned by top-chocolatier Tsujiguchi Hironobu. The pencils are served with a pencil sharpener to grate chocolate onto the desert. Japan’s Ginkaku-ji in Kyoto is probably the most famous temple in the country. In the hands of artist Yasuhiro Suzuki the “Temple of the Silver Pavilion” gets a silver wrapping and a sweet filling.

It is, of course, most commonly associated with Japanese bondage fetish in which bodies are tied up in visually intricate patterns using hemp rope. The technique originated as a way of subduing prisoners but, at some point in history, the rope split and one end took an artist, albeit rather erotic, turn. Artists like Nobuyoshi Araki, Jim Duvall and Hikari Kesho lead shibari’s NSFW exploits in photography. But now Jo Nagasaka ( previously ) has made the jump into perhaps what is shibari’s first foray in the world of furniture. At Milano Salone this year the designer who leads up Schemata Architects has unveiled SHIBARI, a series of black and white foam seats that take their bulging shapes from being tied up by rope. Visually, the tight ropes provide a counterpoint to the smooth curves of the rubber. The pieces of furniture are finally dipped in a rubber coating, alluding to the full-body latex suits commonly associated with the fetish.

So it comes as no surprise that the cinematographer Takao Inoue has designed a household lamp around the dandelion. OLED TAMPOPO consists of an actual dandelion – harvested, carefully, during Spring – that is sealed into a clear acrylic block. A miniature OLED light is embedded into the stem. “Fragility is expressed by an illuminated wavering TAMPOPO,” says Inoue. “It reminds us of our old memories of picking up dandelion’s puff.

The two visual designer have a radical message: they want their audience to understand that watching TV, playing video games or browsing the web are activities that are usually performed while forgetting one’s own body. Illustrations, on the other hand, are exclusively consumed in the material world. And by touching an illustration, instead of staring at a screen, viewers can connect with the physical world. To prove this, the designers created a series of printed illustrations containing empty spaces for the viewer’s fingers. After placing one’s index or thumbs in them, the graphic suddenly feels like it includes the viewer as a part of the scene, and the image takes a whole new meaning. The feeling that the printed image changes and interacts with the viewer is at the core of the Putting Finger exhibition experience.

Each week the family-themed show revolves around several households across Japan and the small, intimate inner workings that make them function. One of the segments is called “Family Treasure Hunting,” a sort-of-reverse Antiques Roadshow in which hosts randomly go up to strangers and ask them what their household’s most prized possession is. The show’s producers were expecting to find small mementos of deceased family members, but they ended up finding much more than what they bargained for. On last week’s episode the comedy duo Viking were interviewing residents in Yanaka, a neighborhood just north of central Tokyo, asking people to share their family’s treasure. “I have a letter from Sakamoto Ryoma,” offered Yuko Hata, a middle-aged Japanese woman. Laughter ensued from both the show’s hosts and Hata herself as no one truly believed that such a valuable historical artifact – from a major figure in Japan’s transformation from feudal military rule in the 1860’s – was lying around someone’s home in Tokyo. And lying around it was. Upon visiting Hata at her home, the comedic due found that the document in question was haphazardly stored away in a box underneath the family’s coffee table. With Hata’s permission, the show’s staff whisked away the letter to have it officially verified, first at the Sakamoto Ryoma Memorial Museum . “I’m extremely surprised,” said head curator Natsuki Miura, confirming the letter’s authenticity. There are about 140 letters written by Sakamoto in known existence and “each year we get several inquiries regarding letters, but rarely have any turned out to be real,” added Miura. Upon closer observation, scholars discovered that the letter was written to Shojiro Goto, a samurai and politician, and detailed Sakamoto’s visit to Echizen Province (currently Northern-Fukui) to recruit Hachiro Mitsuoka into their new government. The letter, it turns out, was written just 10 days before Sakamoto’s assassination in 1867 and may be the last known letter before his death. At the Shimonoseki Museum , which houses 11 authentic letter – the most in all Japan – by Ryoma Sakamoto, the show’s producers received additional confirmation. A side-by-side comparison revealed identical strokes and tendencies in characters. Proceeding with caution, the show’s producers finally delivered the document to researchers at the Kyoto National Museum . “It’s almost a miracle,” exclaimed researcher Teiichi Miyakawa. “Discoveries likes this happen only once every hundred years.” Not only did the letter back up various speculative historic claims but it also detailed Sakamoto’s hopes and expectations for a new government. According to Hata, the letter was purchased by her father roughly 30 years ago. He paid 1000 yen (~$10) for it at an antique shop. The show’s producers asked appraiser Masaji Yagi how much he thought the letter was worth. He assigned a value of 15 million yen (~$150,000). And just like that, in incredible discovery. And all they had to do was ask. The letter is currently on loan, from Hata, at the Sakamoto Ryoma Memorial Museum for all to see.","post_categories":["Graphic Design"],"post_tags":["samurai","TV show"],"date":"April 16, 2014"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"the best spots to take pictures of Mt.

A knit cap slouched over his head, a sweater draped over his shoulders and his eyes lay focused on the small turntable in front of him. “This is my Dad,” we were told. Apparently we weren’t the only ones who had come to visit Meguru Yamaguchi , a Brooklyn based artist who has made a name for himself by incorporating modern day technological idiosyncrasies like copy & paste, Instagram and Facebook into his artwork. These contemporary promulgations have a tendency to be viewed as self-indulgent, narcissistic and artificial. And yet, at the core of Meguru’s work – and himself as an artist – we find something that is incredibly pure and honest. It was a frigid morning in February and Meguru had met us outside. In a t-shirt. He introduced us to his father Katsuzo Yamaguchi, a retired fashion designer who was previously creative director for Ozone Rocks , the now defunct high-end label for fashion house Ozone Community. “Being in the fashion business we were constantly surrounded by art,” says Meguru’s father, who always insisted on the culture being a large part of his family’s lives. This helps explain why, at the age of 6, Meguru took oil painting classes where he first encountered a Van Gogh. “Our teacher told us to try to recreate the masterpiece,” Meguru recalls of his younger, smaller self, toiling away in front of a small post card of “Sunflowers.” When asked who his favorite artist is, to this day Meguru will tell you it’s Van Gogh. Meguru is 30 years old but when he was 15 (actually if it weren’t for his carefully trimmed facial hair he wouldn’t look a day older) the young artist had the opportunity to see the one of Van Gogh’s Sunflower paintings housed in the office building of a major insurance firm. It’s certainly an odd place for one of the most expensive paintings in the world, but also somehow fitting as part of the series was destroyed by fire during an air raid in 1945. Everything about the painting astonished Meguru but what really left an impression was how real and alive it looked compared to the postcard he had studied as a child. It was an important distinction between virtual and reality that would go on to impact him as an artist. Meguru grew up in Shibuya, Tokyo a hot bed for street culture, which was blossoming in the late 90s and early 2000s. In art school he met the NY-based artist Tomokazu Matsuyama , who encouraged him to visit New York. On a whim Meguru took the plunge and never looked back. “At the time Matsuyama-san probably thought he lured in a real pain in the ass,” joked Meguru. But pain in the ass or not, Meguru ended up spending 5 years working for Matsuyama as his assistant. In New York, Meguru continued to paint. His style was a hybrid: part memories from classic manga like Dragon Ball, part legacy from Tokyo’s graffiti and street culture, and part influence from the colorful work of his boss. Meguru recalls an incident in which Matsuyama went away on a business trip but let him use his studio. “Just don’t get the floors dirty, he told me.” So to play it safe Meguru decided to lay plastic film sheets for protection. Sure enough, he spilled. As he was cleaning up Meguru noticed that the paint he had spilled peeled off, revealing parts the resembled puzzle pieces. This, as he would later come to realize, served as a starting point for what would become his signature style of collaging pieces of paint together. Like all artists, Meguru’s style is a portmanteau of masters that came before him. And his enthusiasm in revealing his artistic SparkNotes shows a deep respect for the techniques of others. Gerhard Richter and graffiti artist Swoon in the way they cut out their subjects. Eric Carle in the way he paints many tissues and leaves them to dry for later use. Jackson Pollock and his undisguised actions. And, more recently, Ryusuke Fukahori in the way he layers resin. It’s a melting pot of styles, just like Tokyo and his adopted home of New York.   Today, Meguru’s work, aside from the abstract streaks, are mostly portraits. And understandably so given the proliferation of selfies on social media. Indeed, many of his subjects come from photos he unintentionally sees on facebook, twitter and instagram. “I guess one of my friends ‘liked’ someone else’s photo and so that showed up in my feed,” recalls Meguru. “It was a photo that belonged to someone completely unknown to me and I was intrigued by the way this landscape appeared and then disappeared right in front of me.” But there’s nothing momentary about Meguru’s paintings. He takes his time on each piece, often putting them aside to let them “ferment” and then returning to them. This one in particular took 2 years, practically a lifetime in social network years. Meguru wandered off into a corner and returned with several trowels. “I started off with this,” he said, referring to the small one. Then he held up a large industrial-looking one. “But now I use this. It takes two people.” He was referring to his paint streaks, which are made by starting off with large puddles of paint and, in a single swoop, spread across a protective film that lay strewn across the studio. Once the paint dries, Meguru painstakingly removes all the parts, small and large, that do not contain paint. This can takes several days but once complete it is then sealed with a coat of resin. The resulting piece – an almost violent swipe of color – can be installed on walls and building facades. In fact, a similar piece was installed on the façade of the Japanese-owned East Village bike shop Chari & Co. last year. Landscapes – a historically classical subject in art – is important for Meguru. Some of his most daring and exciting aspirations have to do with the urban landscape of New York. “I would love to be able to paint an entire building facade,” he says, with a child-like naivete. And yet his sincerity may very well pay off. Amongst potential upcoming projects is a mural on the side of a building in Harlem, as well as a collaboration with the fashion label Rag & Bone to display his work on their walls. But public art also means throwing yourself into a sometimes-merciless pack of critics and vandals. When a previous piece was in the Lower East Side was damaged Meguru attempted to return to the site to restore it. But instead of blaming others he carries the burden himself. “If the artwork is powerful enough, no one will mess with it.” As usual, Huey (7) had a few questions for Meguru. Meguru was kind enough to offer a piece of his art to a lucky reader. To qualify all you have to do is leave a comment below and 1 person will be selected at random.

But that wasn’t the case just 100 years ago. Cartographers had to actually go out and explore their subjects, taking precise measurements and making difficult calculations. One of these artists was Hatsusaburo Yoshida (1884-1955). Born in Kyoto and raised by a single mother, Yoshida originally was trained as a textile designer. Yoshida was one of the most popular cartographers of his time, not because his maps were accurate – they were actually deformed and, at times, illogical – but because he spent an enormous amount of time surveying the land. Before even beginning his work he would spend months walking around the site, interviewing people and discovering local favorites. The spots he chose to emphasize in his maps actually created landmarks that are now famous today. Orders were coming in from all over the country and Yoshida had to expand his practice, hiring several assistants to help him create over 3000 maps. But Yoshida’s success was not permanent. When WWII began, the military deemed Yoshida’s maps to be a threat to homeland security, essentially crushing his practice. After the war ended, Yoshida left behind one final map of Hiroshima, depicting the land just moments after the detonation of the atomic bomb. Today (March 4) is actually his birthday and Google Japan has created an homage to his work. source: wikipedia","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["maps"],"date":"March 3, 2014"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"A Paper Tree Made From the Imprints of Tree Bark","content":"Picking up where we left off in our review of this year’s BFA art shows from Japan, we present to you a tree made from washi paper.

The Japanese website was founded in 2007 as an online community of artists. Their user base grew briskly and just last month they surpasses 10 million users. To celebrate the milestone, the team initiated a community project, calling on their users to submit artwork to create a single mega-scale illustration. Users could submit 1 piece per day over a 9-day period. The only stipulation was that the illustrations were to be in the shape of ema (絵馬): wooden plaques with pictures and wishes on them that are customarily hung at Shinto shrines. The final artwork would combine all the ema into a single massive ema. On February 22, the illustrations began rolling in and by the end of the period the project had received an astounding 52,014 illustrations. The final work , a microcosmic portrayal of the community of artists, looks like a massive universe. “pixiv currently gets on average 26K submissions per day,” writes* a staff member in a blog post explaining the project. “It’s difficult to actually get a sense for what 26K illustrations look like.” And so the team came up with a way to visualize their entire community of artists. source: KAI-YOU","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["multiplicity"],"date":"March 6, 2014"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Prototype 1000 | prototypes of products we all wish existed","content":"Prototype 1000 is a site created by web designer Nezi Sato that functions as a database for all his crazy dream-like prototypes of products he wished existed.

Literally, “interlocking hell,” the complex technique can be observed, on a smaller scale, in the wooden frames of shoji screens. The fear-inducing name seems to have been derived not only from the complexity and difficulty of the craft, but also because it is near-impossible to disassemble once complete. In fact, jigoku-gumi was used to create the 635-year old shoji screens in Kyoto’s Toji Mieido temple (renovated in 1380), as well as the 815-year old fusuma sliding doors in Wakayama’s Kongōbu-ji temple. In other words, jigoku-gumi is not meant to be taken halfheartedly. But reviving the technique, and taking it to awe-inspiring heights, is the architect Kengo Kuma , who just completed SunnyHills in the posh neighborhood of Minami-Aoyama, Tokyo. Nestled amongst designer boutiques like Herzog & De Meuron’s Prada building and the Nezu Museum, designed by Kuma himself, the bold structure of entwined wood feels right at home. And there’s nothing hellish about SunnyHills, the first Japanese location of a popular Taiwanese pineapple cake shop. The 3-story structure, which opened in late December of last year, has made it their mission to offer visitors free tea and cake, even if they are not buying anything. “That’s just the spirit of Taiwanese hospitality,” says Michael Sheu, an IT exec who discovered he had a sweet tooth at age 50. Sheu is capitalizing on a pineapple cake market that has grown in size from $100 mm 5 years ago to a little under a billion dollars. Once you walk through the entrance of the wooden latticework on the ground floor, you’re immediately transported into a forest of light filtering through the cracks. It’s easy to get lost in the shadows, as well as the aroma of Japanese hinoki wood. When asked why he transferred from IT to confectionary Sheu responded that it was because he wanted to return to more simpler times. He wanted to create a forest of wilderness that recalled his days as a child growing up in the mountainous regions of Taiwan.

Ice Hills Hotel was conceived by a local real estate company as part of Creative Hokkaido , an initiative designed to telegraph Hokkaido’s creative culture beyond their island. Under the creative direction of Clark Gallery, 3 artists – Toshihiko Shibuya , Midori Kambara and Leo Fujisawa – were tapped to each design separate hotel rooms. Inspired by the beauty of white, Sapporo-based artist Midori Kambara chose to create a white landscape of grass and flowers carved into the snow wall. Moving in the opposite direction from Kambara, the installation artist Toshihiko Shibuya decided to experiment with color.

But the address is where the similarities end. As of 2010, the 9 square kilometer (about 1680 football stadiums, for all you Super Bowl fans out there) island has 98 households and a population of 165, making it the smallest village in all of Japan. Looking almost like a Jurassic Park-like natural fortress, the volcanic island is known as a caldera. Within the large crater is a smaller crater – a cinder cone – that was formed after the larger explosion. The steep rugged cliffs of layered volcanic deposits rise up as high as 1388 feet. How people first ended up on the island is largely considered a mystery. The island’s own legend has it that the island was once forbidden to women because it was believed that man and women living together on the island would anger the gods. The first written records of the island appear around the 15th century and many of them are of shipwrecks so there’s a strong possibility that sailors may have taken refuge on the island and eventually made it their home. A series of earthquakes in 1780-81 was followed by volcanic activity 2 years later. Lava flows burned down all the houses and residents were forced to flee to the nearest island, Hachijojima. Unfortunately, about half of the 327 residents did not make it out in time and perished. Those who did survive were forced to live out the next 40 years of their life on Hachijojima. Some sought out new life elsewhere but others could never forget their beloved island. One of these people was Jirodayu Sasaki, who, after 18 years of planning, courageously led an expedition back to the island and successfully resettled in 1835. He’s considered a hero on the island and there’s even a statue of him. In this day and age, getting to Aogashima is actually much easier than you might have thought. They even have their own heliport!  So what do you actually do once you get to this lost paradise? Well what it doesn’t have in beaches the island makes up in starry skies. Photographer Toshihiko Ogawa documented some of these fantastic starry nights. The photos were taken from the 2nd caldera, where many people will go to camp out. There is also a volcanic natural hot spring where you rest those muscles from all the rock climbing you did getting there. Otherwise there’s plenty of fishing, hiking trails and shrines to see. And the internet is probably shoddy so it’s the perfect place to unplug.

The lights burned overtime as Japan worked to meet the greatest shipbuilding boom in its history. All 54 ways at Japan’s nine major shipyards are occupied; one ship is barely launched before a new keel is laid,” reported TIME Magazine in 1964. Indeed, Japan used shipbuilding in the 1950s and 1960s to rebuild its industrial structure and the country dominated in the late 1980s, filling more than half of all orders worldwide. Japan has since lost its competitive edge to countries like South Korea but now, a group of artisans and designers are looking to revive shipbuilding but in an entirely different way – through furniture. “The heritage of many of the woodworking techniques used by Japanese carpenters originates from Japanese shipwrights,” said Jin Kuramoto ( previously ), who recently teamed up with a group of Hiroshima-based woodworkers to create a new furniture brand, MATSUSO T. The brand is debuting with 2 lineups; the first, designed by Kuramoto himself, is called Nadia.

And that’s not because the building was in bad shape. Rather, the particular artist left no rock unturned – and no crack uncovered – as he taped up windows, installed fans and hung plastic covers. “I work a lot with spray paint,” he said, as he walked to the back of his rectangular studio and pointed at the several fans fixed in his window sill. “I have to make sure there’s always plenty of ventilation.” Enrico has been hard to pinpoint. On and off residency programs have kept him traveling between the US and Japan. But for now, comfortably settled in his Brooklyn studio, it looks as though he is here to stay a while. The slender, 6ft tall artist, whose full name is Ōyama Enrico Isamu Letter , is the son of a kimono shop owner and an Italian diplomat. His adolescent years were spent in Tokyo around the turn of the century, a time when street culture, hip hop and skateboarding were penetrating the youth like never before. “There were the skaters and the break dancers,” recalls Enrico. “Everyone had their thing.” But the less-mainstream graffiti world had yet to be explored so Enrico decided to stake out his claim there. Drawing came relatively easy for Enrico, who not only spent his younger years drawing manga characters, but had also just returned from an inspirational study-abroad in Italy where the graffiti had left an impression on him. (The word “graffiti” comes from the Italian word graffiato, meaning “scratched”.) Before long his drive to create graffiti evolved from being rooted in teenager self-consciousness to passion for art. But unlike conventional graffiti artists whose purpose it was to “tag” their names on streets and throughout the city, Enrico’s art remained confined within the borders of his notebook. This would become an important distinction for Enrico and an encounter in the near-future would make this clear in his mind. “I met a famous graffiti artist and showed him the work I had created in my notebook.” Enrico recalls the event with clarity and significance. “It’s good, he told me. But it’s just on paper. It’s not graffiti.” It was at this point, it would seem, that the idea of abandoning letter forms – a primary element of name tagging and, in effect, graffiti – became more clear in Enrico’s mind. They dissolved into abstraction. He was no longer a graffiti artist. (And despite the clear influence on his practice, he never calls himself a graffiti artist, perhaps out of respect to street graffiti artists who willingly take on legal and criminal risks.) And realizing that he was also no longer confined to visual representation, colors and letters were replaced by intentionally abstracted black and white lines. It was what would become known as QTS. “This is Quick Turn Structure,” Enrico said, pointing to a larger canvas that hung on his wall. It’s a term coined by Enrico himself – often abbreviated as QTS – and is a derivative of actual graffiti terminology. QTS refers to “lines that slash back, spin and intercross.” It’s been a recurring motif in Enrico’s work since the early 2000s. At around the age of 19 Enrico began doing live-painting at Milk and other clubs around Tokyo. His gigs – some of them paid but mostly unpaid – would last from about 10pm to 3am. His midnight escapades continued for about 4-5 years and became an important practice-based mechanism in evolving QTS into his own visual language. Enrico talks about QTS as if it’s alive, with a mind of it’s own: “Its tightly‐knit structure multiplies by intrinsic order and keeps moving without hardening up. What is driving this process is not a mathematical procedure, nor a random coincidence, but a somatically acquired method through actions performed on various media of different scales and materials.” It’s no surprise that Enrico is eloquent and articulate when discussing his work. At the suggestion of artist and relative Toru Oyama, Enrico decided to apply to graduate school. With application deadlines approaching in just about 1 month, Enrico quickly assembled a portfolio and submitted his application to Tokyo University of the Arts. He was accepted. To approach the subject of graffiti in graduate school is rather rare. His program at the school, “ Intermedia Art ,” was as ambiguous as it sounds – a place for the misfits, the etcetera; those who didn’t fall into any traditional categories. Feeling the need to critique, from an academic perspective, the yet-to-be academicized subject of graffiti art, Enrico began writing about graffiti as well. Enrico is often commissioned to apply QTS to walls or buildings but his work isn’t always grand. This miniscule series was created by sharpening an already pointy mechanical pencil, drawing a few lines, and then sharpening the graphite once again before continuing. They take about a week and are the most labor intensive QTS, Enrico concedes. Click below for a better view of the astounding detail. After staying on for 1 additional year as a researcher, Enrico left the university in 2010. He first came to NY on an ACC grant and then again on a Pola grant. His ex-professor Kazue Kobata, an active curator in both NY and Tokyo, helped him with his move.  Now he is here on his own. Recently, Enrico has been collecting old framed paintings he finds on his travels or at thrift shops. He pays no more than $5 or $10 for most of these. And perhaps referencing a more traditional practice in graffiti of painting over an existing canvas, he applies his QTS. “I picked this up for about 500 yen when I was in Japan,” he said, pointing to an old bookkeeping tablet that looked like it was from the 17th century. Enrico is of a new generation of post-kawaii Japanese artists who have broke free from many of the stereotypes attached to Japanese art. “I have removed all secondary elements from my work,” he tells us. “One of those elements is .” “What interests me is Enrico’s obsessive study about graffiti cultures and creation of his own visual language as “quick turn structure,” said Kosuke Fujitaka , who recently included Enrico’s work in an exhibition in Tokyo . Indeed, Enrico brings the calculating eye of a researcher to the historically improvised hustle of graffiti. Enrico takes his work very seriously and is not willing to compromise. In 2011 he was presented the opportunity to collaborate with COMME des GARÇONS. However, Rei Kawakubo was looking for a more traditional graffiti artist to tag her clothing collection. “That’s not my style,” he told Kawakubo in a meeting. “I can do that but others can do that too. If I work with you, I’d prefer to do something only I can do.” The next day his phone rang. He got the job . Enrico is currently preparing for a group exhibition at Galerie Protege in early 2014, and a solo exhibition at the New Jersey City University.  But his ambitions reach beyond the US and Japan. When asked what his dream project was: “One day I want to create a mural on an iceberg in the North Pole.” As usual, Huey (almost 7) had a few questions for Enrico: This studio visit is part of an ongoing series in which we visit NY-based Japanese artists in their creative space.","post_categories":["Art","studio visit"],"post_tags":["street art","studio visit"],"date":"December 30, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"less is more | Nendo Reinvents the Chopstick by turning two into one","content":"Your chopsticks can make your food taste better, claims Hashikura Matsukan , a chopstick manufacturer steeped in 400 years of history.

Coming home after his job as a school janitor, the father spent his nights creating the masterpiece. It took an astounding 7 years. We reached out to the daughter and became the first outlet to carry prints of this amazing work of art. It was also an important catalyst in actually launching our shop. Everything that Tokujin Yoshioka does is amazing, which is why he’s featured in our explore page . It also explains why he’s in the top 3 for an incredibly poetic piece. For 6 months he subjected crystals to the tonal vibrations of Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake. The resulting bed of crystal growth became part of his solo exhibition that took place over the Summer. “Nature shows us a beauty that exceeds our imagination,” he says. “The forms of nature are unique and cannot be reproduced. This endows them with mysterious beauty and makes them fascinating to us”. Some questioned it’s acoustics but conceptually it wowed the world. Japanese architect Arata Isozaki teamed up with British-Indian sculptor Anish Kapoor to create an inflatable concert hall. Dubbed Arc Nova , the mobile venue toured the earthquake and tsunami-ravaged areas of Tohoku, delivering hope and encouragement in the form of music. I love reviewing art school exhibitions and uncovering talent in the creative youth. In fact, the student work sub-genre is one of my favorites. And one of our most popular posts was a relatively recent feature we did on two girls who photographed coupled cuddling. And they did it with x-ray machines. Romantic? No. Intimate? Absolutely. Interestingly, this was our only post to make the top 10, that wasn’t published in 2013. Last year we broke the story about a small sculptor on a quest for true love. A rate type of puffer fish found in Amami-Oshima creates underwater sand sculptures designed specifically to attract mates. It’s a fascinating story and I suggest you read it in its entirety , if you haven’t done so already. We even helped coordinate a BBC shoot about the puffer fish for an upcoming documentary. The title says it all. When it comes to latte art, it’s hard to beat Kazuki Yamamoto. Giving first priority to the legitimate inhabitants of this forest in Japan, architect Keisuke Kawaguchi , designed a home to fit in between the gaps of trees. For a White Day project FabCafe in Shibuya let guys come in and make gummy replicas of themselves to give to that special lady. Last but certainly not least is another student project.

Ask him a question about his work and you’ll get a 20-minute answer that ends with Minami’s description of the final scene in Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1962 film Eclipse. But therein lies the genius of the enigmatic, all-over-the-place designer. And maybe that’s why his current retrospective “Mass Production” at hpgrp gallery feels so timely. It is indeed the first time Minami’s extensive, eclectic body of work, which includes a MoMA inducted Dunny toy of his model, Reebok sneakers, Eastpak carry-on luggage and a $5000 Affinity track bike, is being showcased together. And headlining the show is over 100 t-shirts (only a fraction of the work) from the Kenzo Minami apparel line, which had a healthy 9-year run and ended in 2011. And now he is in the midst of considering to reboot the line. We caught up with Minami on site to discuss his current show. Kenzo Minami: Mass Production  hpgrp gallery , New York now extended through December 21, 2013    The apparel line was essential in not only defining who Minami was, but also delivering his products to people who typically would never have any exposure to him. Minami got a kick-start when major retailers like Barneys in New York and Isetan in Tokyo bought his clothing. “There is a huge gap there,” says Minami, explaining how the simple act of creating a garment catapulted his exposure from being confined to graphic design nerds all the way to teenagers across Japan. “This was how I opened a portal.” The product designer-turned graphic designer got his start in television but eventually transitioned into the role of freelance as his side projects became main projects. You can read more about him in our studio visit , conducted earlier this year. Stepping into the room of t-shirts hanging from above is like stepping into the head of Minami himself. Each t-shirt is bold and dynamic in its own right. And the graphic quality is enough to quench the thirst of fashionistas and graphic design aficionados alike. But dig a little deeper and an oasis of tidbits, tricks and inside jokes will reveal themselves. Prime numbers, Nostradamus, the music of John Cage, the films of Jon Luc Godard, the essays of Tristan Tzara, the music of the Bee Gees – these are just some of the many themes that are sitting, waiting to be uncovered. It is perhaps key to understanding Minami’s work and the hopes and wishes he imbeds in every piece produces. “There is an infinite amount of amazing, fun information out there and it’s so fun to discover it,” Minami says, excitedly. “I feel like people are missing out.

Exactly. Japanese product design firm H Concept has unveiled their latest: UnBRELLA , an inverted umbrella. Why exactly would you want to invert an umbrella? Well, if you live in a crowded metropolis like Tokyo there are many reasons. When you jump on a crowded train after escaping a downpour your dripping wet umbrella usually brushes up against your bag, your clothes or – even worse – a stranger. But by inverting the design, the wet side of the umbrella faces inward when closed, exposing only the dry side. And that’s not all: the innovative design makes it easier to open when coming out of a car or other covered area. And when not in use the UNBRELLA stands up on its own.  “It’s been nearly 10 years in the making since I originally conceived the idea,” revealed Hiroshi Kajimoto , the industrial designer who spent roughly a decade improving the umbrella. “I’ve finally created the UnBRELLA – an upside down umbrella truly required upside down thinking.” The question is, will people be willing to pay for innovation?

It’s an odd word to hear in a sentence, made only odder as a seeming tourist destination. But In Japan, especially around this time of year, it’s a term that casts a twinkle in the eye of every romantic, spectacle-loving soul around. Illumination refers to the act of using numerous holiday bulbs to light up streets, gardens or other public spaces. It’s a special event in Japan and is always heavily attended. If you’re looking to participate, here are some of this year’s not-to-miss illumination spectacles. Japan’s very first illumination occurred in Sapporo in 1981. A modest 1048 bulbs lit up Oodori Park in 1981. But the northern city has come a long way since then. This year’s “ white illumination ,” taking place in the same spot it did 32 years ago, features 420,000 that culminate in “crystal river” of lights. The entire show runs on self-generated biodiesel energy. Thought flowers were only for the spring and summer? Think again. During the winter Tochigi’s Ashikaga Flower Park recreates many of their famous floral attractions using LED lights – 2.1 million LED lights to be exact. And yes, it includes their famous wisteria tree . If you’re in Tokyo, head to Tokyo Midtown . Each year the shopping/business complex puts on an impressive show and this year is now different. Their 2000 sq meter public yard is being converted into a “starlight garden” of 280,000 LED lights. They’re even boasting the world’s first attempt at installing “cross-over illumination,” which is supposedly some sort of cutting edge technology to create illuminated arches. And while you’re at Tokyo Midtown, why not hop over to KITTE , the city’s newest shopping complex right outside Tokyo Station? There you’ll find an architect-designed Christmas tree accompanied by a special ceiling installation that creates the illusion of snow indoors. It was designed by Makoto Tanijiri. If you’re interested in sheer numbers, head down to Kanagawa for the Sagamiko Illumillio. Coming in at 4 million bulbs (what does that even look like when in storage?) the amusement park is also the Kanto region’s largest light show. And if that’s not enough of a reason to go, the amusement park rides stay open late during the holidays. But for the absolute largest display of lights in all of Japan you’re going to have to head farther down south to Mie prefecture. The Nabana no Sato Winter Illumination boasts 7 million LED bulbs that are sure to satisfy your luminous desires. The main attraction is, of course, the light tunnel – a long archway decked out in yellow lights that will make you feel like you’re walking under the milky way. But there are also many other sights that rival the tunnel like the twin trees and a light bulb representation of Mt. Fuji.","post_categories":["Go and See"],"post_tags":["landmarks","tokyo guide play"],"date":"December 11, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"If you’re an exchange student in Japan you may end up staying in this gorgeous house","content":"If you’re headed to Japan as a foreign exchange student staying with a host family, and if you’re really lucky (I mean, stepped in dog poo lucky) you may end up lodging in this gorgeous home designed by Apollo Architects .

Riusuke Fukahori: The Painted Breath Joshua Liner, New York 11.21.13 – 01.18.14 If you want to learn more about the artist, this is what we wrote when we covered his work last year: The goldfish holds a very special place in the heart of any child who’s ever been to a matsuri (street festival) in Japan. Kingyo-sukui is the game of “goldfish scooping” and is a staple of any summer street festival, along with the masks, water balloon yo-yos, fireworks and yummy food. But for artist Riusuke Fukahori , the goldfish was not just a relic of long-lost childhood. As he painfully lay in his room one night, struggling and suffering, about to give up on his art, he looked over and saw a goldfish. His neglected fish of 7 years sputtered about in a cesspool of mold and feces – a common fate endured by most festival souvenirs. Fukahori felt a shiver run down his spine. What he suddenly saw was a beautiful animal, glowing in bright red, living and surviving. The artist pulled out his paint and set to work, immediately triggering some sort of chemical reaction in his brain. Fukahori had looked far and wide – in Europe, the U.S. and Japan – for his muse. But in an instantaneous form of enlightenment he knew that all along it was right there in his room, inside that dirty fish tank.

And while some of it is hyperbole and sensationalism generated by an overly zealous foreign press, Japan does lead the world in toilet technology. The country also takes great pride in cleanliness and restrooms are one of the first places to begin. The public restroom has largely been shunned as an architectural subject in the western world but in Japan it stands as its own archetype. Here are some recent public restroom designs in Japan that have been turning heads for reasons other than an uncontrollable bladder. Halfitecture OO is 1 of 3 public restrooms that architect Endo Shuhei designed inside the Osaka Castle Park. Reminiscent of a Richard Serra sculpture, the truss-shaped walls are made of a single sheet of anti-corrosive steel that holds up its own weight. Underneath the steel sheet is a white box that holds the actual lavatory facilities.  Located in Chikusei City (Ibaraki), a region known for their historical stone storage buildings (i ), a group of citizens operate Tokinokura – a storage building converted into an event space for hosting exhibitions. In 2008 the group selected Shuichiro Yoshida to design a much-needed lavatory for staff and visitors. It was constructed in a narrow alley behind the building, hence the high ceilings.  In 2009 Bunzo Ogawa of Future Studio was selected to design a series of public restrooms to be designed in public parks across the city of Hiroshima. Ogawa proposed three repeatable designs that could adapt to the different sizes of parks. (By law, Japanese public restrooms cannot encompass more than 2% of a park’s surface area.) The concept of the restrooms were to embed the City of Hiroshima with an “absolute axis,” similar to the horizontal and vertical axes of the planet, with all arrows pointing North. In Essence, the arrows create a place that is no longer pinned down as a city within Japan, on a map, that was destroyed by nuclear weapons. Instead, it is now part of a grander space and transcends towards a coexistence with the planet. And I suppose those encountering the restrooms have an even greater sense of this. It helps them imagine what is beyond the park fence, or the neighbors wall, or the city’s high-rise buildings.   Connect the town – this was the seemingly simple yet lofty goal entrusted to Takao Shiotsuka Atelier as they set about designing a park and public restroom in the middle of historic Kikuchi City in Kumamoto. The result was 3 different parks and restrooms, each with their own theme, that weave throughout the town. One of the restrooms is reminiscent of an abstract rock placed within the center of a Zen garden. Another forms from curved metal pipes that define the pathways and then create circular restrooms. In the middle of Chiba’s Boso peninsula is Itabu Station, a lone, unmanned station that sits on the Kominato Line. Trains come and go about every 2 hours and, on average, deliver about 6 people. In stark contrast to the very quiet nature of the station sits a facility that makes a very bold statement: “the world’s largest public restroom.” Completed in 2012 by architect Sou Fujimoto , the grand lavatory – a clear glass box sitting in the middle of a lush flower garden – encompasses an area 200 sq meters (about 2150 sq ft). It is indeed larger than the train station it accompanies. photos by Iwan Baan The lavish, larger-than-life-lavatory, which is encompassed by a pervert-preventing black wooden log fence, was designed to both attract visitors but to also be part of an art fair happening this year. Indeed, those statistics I quoted earlier were as of 2010. We’ll just have to wait and see if foot traffic picks up. Note to visitors: The restroom is for women only. Guys will be asked to use a much more modest bathroom nearby.    Part art installation part functioning public restroom, “Hut with the Arc Wall” was created by Tato Architects for the 2013 Setouchi Triennale . Located on Shodoshima Island, the architects drew inspiration from the large cedar barrels originally used to make soy sauce on that exact site. And the roof is made from a mixture of opaque and transparent tiles, which allows sunlight to filter in during the day but also creates quite a spectacle at night.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["architecture-public-space","toilets"],"date":"November 3, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Teshima Yokoo House | a renovated home turns into a museum","content":"A bright, iridescent rock garden.

One major theme throughout the space is the convergence of art and architecture. Translucent red panels appear throughout the space, at times making it appear is if a whole room is just a painting in itself. The red glass also has the strange effect of making the red rock garden disappear. What makes the space special is it’s efforts to involve the locals citizens, most of whom are elderly. Neighbors were always welcome to observe the construction process and they were even invited to help lay the ceramic tiles in the rock garden. Through a collaborative process, the site became part of the community rather than just a museum.

In almost every public appearance he is seen in a black t-shirt and dark jeans. But the similarities extend beyond uniform. Everything he touches – paper, plastic, wood, glass – turns to gold. The industrial designer has a knack for turning unexpected materials into something minimally exquisite. “Maybe I just find hidden beauty in things which others have not noticed before me,” he once said . But true fans of Yoshioka’s should stop reading right now. “Once it is worded, I fear that the image disappears,” he also added. In recent years the industrial designer has been experimenting with glass and crystal, combining small particles into something grand. At times his forms are carefully guided and constructed, such as the Rainbow Church, one of the centerpieces of his current retrospective going on at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo (MOT). The spiritual piece is a 26-ft high glass window made of 500 crystal prisms. Yoshioka once explained that the piece was inspired by a trip to the Chapelle du Rosaire in France where Henri Matisse spent a great deal of his last remaining time on the stained glass windows. But almost as if to counteract his own architectural forms, the designer, at times, likes to cede control to nature. Also on display is “Spider’s Thread Chair” constructed from seven fine threads. And while the structure of the chair is truly just thread, crystals have grown wild along the lines, allowing nature to give form to the poetic chair. In fact, the piece of furniture is inspired by the 1918 short story, “The Spider’s Thread,” by Ryunosuke Akutagawa.

Throughout the whole time they’ve been exposed to the music from Tchaikovsky’s ballet, Swan Lake. The tonal vibrations and pulsations materialize within the crystal, dictating its final form. According to Phenom World, a Netherlands based manufacturer of electron microscopes and other high-tech imaging tools, “crystals exposed to music showed differences in size, form and structure of the surface. But what exactly about different frequencies and rhythm vibrations causes the change still remains a mystery.  “I believe that a design is not something that is completed through being given a form, but rather something that is completed by the human heart.

Drab, grey walls. Generic cubicles. Desks crammed next to each other. These are some of the images we conjure up. But there are an exceptional few trying to break the mold. And they’re not always tech startups. In the center of Tokyo’s busy financial district is Pasona , a multi-national recruitment firm. When the company decided they needed a new headquarters they hired Japanese architect Yoshimi Kono to help renovate a large, 9-story building and adorn it with a lush, green wall. But the vegetation doesn’t just live on the exterior. Integrated within the building are urban farming facilities that occupy roughly 20% of the entire office space and support 200 species of fruits, vegetables and rice. Office workers take turns helping to maintain the urban farm and harvest the food, most of which ends up being served in the office cafeteria. “It is the largest and most direct farm-to-table of its kind ever realized inside an office building in Japan,” says the architect. Monocle Magazine created a great little video on the building, which is also worth checking out. It turns out that the farming project is also independently sustainable. While not only saving on food transportation costs, the idea has generated so much positive feedback that it’s spawned a business venture within the company to teach others about urban farming. Brilliant! From the architect: “Using both hydroponic and soil based farming, crops and office workers share a common space. For example, tomato vines are suspended above conference tables, lemon and passion fruit trees are used as partitions for meeting spaces, salad leaves are grown inside seminar rooms and bean sprouts are grown under benches.” source: abcnews | konodesign s","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["Green Design","offices","tokyo guide","tokyo guide play"],"date":"September 12, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Ghibli Character Fan Art by Yunbymunch","content":"The celebrated Japanese animator and head of Studio Ghibli announced his retirement last week saying , “I feel that my days in feature film are done.” He reasoned that old age had made him slower and that he had other things he wanted to do. Being the obsessive-compulsive workaholic that he is, he simply did not have the time for another feature film.

To this day one of my most proudest achievements while growing up in Tokyo was sneaking into the actual Studio Ghibli with a friend. It was only a 10 minute bike-ride away from my house. Anyway, to honor him and his legacy I’d like to show a series of wonderful fan art created by an illustrator that simply goes by the name yunbymunch .

Based in Tokyo, Takayo Kiyota is a self-proclaimed illustrator and makizushi artist who goes by the name Tama-chan. What exactly is a makizushi artist, you might wonder? Well have a look below. Tama-chan lays her ingredients just so, visualizing in her head how the cross-section – her creation – will look once cut. “I never know what the inside looks like so I’m never sure if it will come out the way I imagined. And I can’t make edits once it’s done,” writes Tama-chan. “Facial expressions are especially difficult because small ingredients or overly exerted force when wrapping can completely throw things off. It’s always a special moment when I make the first incision to reveal the image.” * Do you like what you are hearing so far? That’s what I thought. Let’s move on Sometimes Tama-chan is commissioned to create her edible artwork. Like this one, which she did for an article on the globalization of  Japanese food. Other times she just does it for fun, like this mermaid, which she made this summer. Tama-chan also holds workshops for adults and kids. For this workshop she taught a group of kids how to make yokai (Japanese demon) makizushi.  Do you watch much Japanese TV? If so you’ll most certainly recognize the protagonist from NHK’s “Ama-chan” and her frequently used expression of surprise. This fascinating roll shows the development of an embryo. It’s actually a single roll that, depending on where it’s cut, reveals different stages.   Anyone want to guess which famous painting this is based on? Another famous painting.

Realizing that he had amassed an overwhelming collection of data, 28-year old Japanese artist Kazuki Umezawa one day decided to begin turning his collection into art. His work, which features beady anime eyes, figures and graphics that collide with his own paint, is now part of a large scale exhibition at the Mori Art Museum and a solo show at Diesel Denim Gallery . He assembles his data in photoshop files, which can run anywhere from 3GB to 30GB. And the imagery he uses changes, along with the currents of time. For example, after 3.11 he began incorporating a lot of tsunami imagery because that was simply what he was coming across online. With appropriated online imagery and his own craftwork, Umezawa creates a world in which the data of physical reality and virtual reality clash together. source: press release","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["Anime","collages","data","internet"],"date":"August 30, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Japanese pastry beds let you be the filling","content":"I have a soft spot for Japanese bakeries.

Yu-Ichi was perhaps his own biggest critic, maintaining a practice of destroying everything he felt was inferior work. As a result, relatively few works currently exist. “His focus is not on the aesthetics of the characters, but rather on the unfettered development of his inner power as directly expressed by the writing. He overcomes traditional calligraphy in favor of radical expressiveness,” says the Japan Art Gallery in Frankfurt, who owns exclusive rights to the sale of Yu-Ichi’s work in Europe.

Now at age 78, he is respected by fellow tori-tetsu* (撮り鉄) as a pioneer of train photography. *train aficionados in Japan are largely broken down into the following four categories: tori-tetsu (photographers), nori-tetsu (riders), shushu-tetsu (collectors) and mokei-tetsu (model builders). But you won’t find him at any famous spots or publicized train events, ceremonies or, especially, cherry blossom season, when hoards of people carrying heavy duty  SLRs swarm around trains trying to get the perfect shot. Hirota avoids these places like the plague. “I’m captivated by trains when they’re in their most normal state,” he explains. “Trains in their normal state are alive. Events and ceremonies are staged. You won’t learn anything from attending those. Admittedly, there are some spots that I’ve incidentally made famous,” Hirota adds. Now joined by his son Izumi, who is carrying on the tradition, Hirota specializes in suburban trains – those that run maybe only twice or three times a day. Naturally, this presents its own challenges. “When I hear the train coming I begin trembling with excitement,” says Hirota, describing the fleeting moments before the train disappears, not to emerge for another several hours. But this is all part of Hirota’s process. Once the train has left, he gets up from his location and walks. He walks along the tracks, encounters side streets, small shops and empty stations.

According to Oak House , Japan’s largest operator of shared living spaces, available units have grown 20 fold since the company’s inception in 1998. Whereas older buildings are typically converted, Naruse-Inokuma Architects were asked to create a newly constructed building for shared living. In other words, the architects were given the opportunity to rethink shared living and redesign the entire experience, giving birth to LT Josai , which opened their doors last month.  The space is divided into 13 different individual rooms that all range between 58,000 ~ 62,000 yen per month. The negative space created by the layout of the rooms serve as shared living areas – some more dynamic and inviting while others are intended for smaller, quieter usage.  And anyone who thinks shared living can’t work in Japan needs only harken back to the Showa era when homes were primarily left unlocked and neighbors would come and go as they pleased. The home functioned more as a community center than a private residence. In an increasingly isolated age where people immediately turn to TV and Internet for the “voices” in their home, shared living offers a more personable, community-oriented voice that once was the backbone of Japanese society.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["co-working","Naruse-Inokuma"],"date":"August 20, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"The Ceramic Miniature Figurines of Mayumi Yamashita","content":"Ceramic artist Mayumi Yamashita makes hand-built and wheel-thrown sculptures and then adds miniature figurines to create whimsical, humorous works of art.

He propped it up, only to push it down, startling audience members as it crashed to the floor. The designer, who runs a Japan-based design firm called Nosigner , was making a point about aesthetics, but also about harmony. “Japan is a beautiful country, don’t you think?” he said, beginning his talk. “But it’s not because Japan designs beautiful things. I think it’s because Japan designs harmony amongst those things.” By “harmony” Tachikawa was referring to Japan’s mighty ability to combine different values, different mediums, different points of view, and different positions, and unite them on a higher level. However, as he went on to argue in his talk titled “Take back the aesthetics of Japan,” this harmony has been disrupted. Some of Japan’s most beautiful landmarks have been disrupted – ruined, even – by ugly and unnecessary signage. “Harmony is to be valued” (和を以て貴しとなす) he said, invoking a phrase from the Seventeen-Article Constitution set forth by Prince Shōtoku in the 7th century. This is a sign pointing to the tombstone of the great Oda Nobunaga, who single-handedly unified Japan under the shogunate in the late 16th century. “I think this would call for seppuku!” On the beautiful site of this ancient temple, the only thing that our generation made was this dingy sign, Tachikawa pointed out. “Are we ok with this?” “I understand they’re doing construction, but is this really necessary?” “What are we trying to show here,” he asked in exasperation. “Isn’t it the castle??” Amongst all this disharmony, Tachikawa identified an opportunity. “We need to take back what our ancestors left us.” Two months later he was in Shodoshima, a small island in the Seto Inland Sea, for a project he called “ Signage for Heritage .” Invited on a residency program, the staff of Nosigner were there on a mission. For 10 days they stayed there, working with the priests and keepers of three different shrines to come up with better solutions and restore some of the beauty that had been lost. “In thinking about harmony on this holy site,” they wrote, “we want to discuss with you how we can create a better environment to connect people with the space.” Below are some progress shots, which I think look amazing.

And whether it’s high-speed bullets, old school locomotives or designer sleeper cars, no country obsesses over trains quite like Japan. So let’s begin our adventure down the rail road starting in Kyushu, the southernmost island of Japan, where the train industry, affected by extraneous circumstances, has evolved on a completely different track compared to its peers. The year was 1987. Japan was in the midst of a bubble economy and prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was pushing through the privatization of state-owned companies. It was a tumultuous time for railways and unprofitable lines were being ruthlessly abandoned. The stakes were high as companies faced extinction. It was just such an environment that pushed Kyushu Railway Company (JR Kyushu) to make the ultimate gamble and institute revolutionary reform. After all, their survival was on the line. At the heart of reform was a strong will to create a unique train that only JR Kyushu could produce. To tackle this feat the man they approached was Eiji Mitooka, an illustrator and industrial designer working in Kyushu. “I had never even designed a train before,” recalls Mitooka, “but they told me I was free to design it however I wanted. I realized that, in order to escape from the generic form of trains at the time, I had to instill a completely new set of values.” The result – the Aqua Express unveiled in 1988 – single highhandedly kick-started a designer train revolution that continued to blossom throughout the years. The Steam Locomotive Hitoyoshi is an old train from 1922 that underwent a drastic 4-year renovation. With billowing smoke, a powerful whistle and enough charisma to whisk you off your feet, it’s the perfect way to relive the roaring 20s. The SL Hitoyoshi makes a 2.5 hour trip through central Kyushu.  Although difficult to discern to the untrained eye, the Tsubame (aka the 800 series) is painted with traditional Japanese white, red and black colors. But even if you don’t notice the exterior, as soon as you walk in it’ll be clear that you are in a train designed around Japanese aesthetics. With kimono-like fabric, gold-plated walls and natural wooden blinds on the windows, the Tsubame is a true Japanese experience. The tsubame makes a 1.5 hours trip from Northern to Southern Kyushu. But it wasn’t just a will to survive that fostered the creative environment around train design. Given it’s port town status, the region had always been more open to new ideas, as opposed to its more conservative counterparts. “Represented by Dejima, Kyushu is somewhat of a gateway where foreign cultures mix,” says Mitooka. “It created a climate that enabled the people of Kyushu to search for new ideas.” Boarding the metallic blue Sonic is like getting into a space station. With ambient lighting that reflects off the metallic interiors, the train is something akin to a ride at Disneyland. In fact, the front of the train almost looks like it’s a transformer. It’s just one of the many reasons that this train is the recipient of the prestigious Brunel Award for outstanding train design. The Sonic makes a 2.5 hours trip around the Northeastern coast of Kyushu, from Hakata to Ooita. A deep black, rather nostalgic train whose name comes from The Hayato people who are believed to be the indigenous people of the land. An abundance of white wood in the interior creates a bright, modern atmosphere that complements the breathtaking observation room, where you’re welcome to come and go as you please. Hayato no Kaze makes a scenic 1.5 hour trip through southern Kyushu.  If you’re traveling with kids, Asoboy may be for you. And no kid-friendly train is complete without a cute mascot, the black dog kuro-chan. A spacious lounge, parent-child-seating, a mini-library, a kids café and a pool of wooden balls are just some of the amenities to keep your toddler enthralled.

At the time there was the 0 series, the 100 series and the 200 series of Shinkansen trainsets. And while the 0 series, which had been around since 1964, were formally withdrawn in 2008, the 3 original series has since grown to a total of 13. The 0 series Shinkansen (1964) | all images courtesy Wikimedia commons | click images to enlarge Seen above is the 100 series (left) and the 200 series (right), the original grandfather trains. From here, Shinkansen can largely be grouped into 2 categories. The first category includes the 200, 400, E1, E2, E3, E4 and E5 series. They are typically color coordinated with green to match the color of their operators logo. These trains were designed specifically to run through cold weather conditions in the north – areas like Joetsu, Nagano, Yamagata and Akita. Special design consideration were made to ensure that the trains were not only well insulated, but could also speed through snowfall. The 400 series (1992) The E1 series (1994) was withdrawn from service in 2012.  The E2 series (1997) Seen above are the E4 series (left) and the E3 series (right). The E series were all introduced as commuter cars, and typically featured double-decker cars for more capacity. As a general rule, a larger number indicates an improvement made on a smaller number.  For example, the E4 is an improved version based on the E1, allowing for faster speeds while still maintaining the same or less friction while traveling. The E5 series (2011) is currently the most advanced shinkansen running. It’s an improved model based on the N700 and can travel up to 320 km/hr (200 mph). On the other side of the spectrum are the 0, 100, 300, 500, 700, 800 and N700 series, which travel in warmer climates and don’t require the same considerations as it’s Northern brethren. Until the most recent E5, the N700 was the most advanced shinkansen. Not only can it travel 300 kph (186 mph) through the mountainous curves of Tokaido, but it’s also equipped with pendulum cars – a revolutionary system that automatically adjusts the tilt of the car as it speeds around curves.

But go and take a look at the stamp in your local station and you’ll likely find it more interesting than you might think. On the 400th anniversary of the Edo Shogunate in 2003, the stamps were expanded to all seventy-seven stations in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Not surprisingly, the theme for a lot of them is Edo-era Tokyo and the stamps often depict places connected to the station’s locale from that period in history. Well, it’s also the fiftieth anniversary of the JR Yamanote Line this year and, given that PingMag’s offices are only a stone’s throw from Uguisudani Station , we decided to take a trip on the line, doing a complete loop and collecting the stamps at every stop. We first got our hands on this rather retro and cute “My Trip Stamp Notebook” to record our stamp rally. The name for this station derives from the nightingales ( ) that were brought here from Kyoto. Unfortunately you won’t be able to hear any nightingales in Uguisudani today, though the rather gaudy decoration on the table with the stamp at the station is pretty striking. The stamp shows the Seven Gods of Fortune , which isn’t so surprising when we consider that Nippori lies between Tabata and Ueno, where there are seven temples enshrined with the gods. Give your stamp a firm press to make the gods’ jolly features really stand out. Nishi-Nippori is the newest station on the Yamanote Line. The stamp shows the view from Suwa promontory, as featured in Utagawa Hiroshige’s famed woodblock print series, ‘One Hundred Famous Views of Edo’. Apparently you could have seen the distant Mt. Tsukuba from the precincts of Suwa Shrine. Tabata is where the Shinkansen trains “live” and from station you can take a look at the carriages being loaded and unloaded from the yard. The stamp shows the station building at the north entrance, which opened in 2008. It’s fun to spot the details to — look at how the station sign in the bottom right is perfectly rendered. The azaleas at Rikugi-en (the gardens located at Komagome) are just like the ones that were popular in the Edo era, and are at their best from the second half of April to late May. Oh, and the station “melody” (all JR Yamanote Line stations have different melodies to announce that trains are about to depart) is a famous nursery rhyme. Sugamo, the Harajuku for grannies . The stamp shows a special statue of the Kannon Buddhist deity that if you wipe with a wet towel in a place that needs curing, it might just yield results. The stamp shows the Toden Arakawa Line, the only streetcar that runs in Tokyo. The Otsuka Station building was also a rare example of a wooden structure on the Yamanote Line but sadly was dismantled in 2008, and the stamp shows the new Otsuka Station. For some reason or other Otsuka was also the only station on the line with black ink for the stamps. Perhaps this has some sort of meaning… Susuki Mimizuku was an old folk toy from Toshima ward, an owl made from pampas grass. The stamp is detailed, even showing the workmanship on the toy. Here you can see the station building on the stamp, Mejiro’s third. The stained glass tower was designed to match the graceful feel of the area. Also, the table with the stamp tells you where to find the corresponding stamps in the next two stations (Ikebukuro and Takadanobaba). The characters in the stamp spell “ Yabusame “, the traditional form of Japanese mounted archery, where the rider has to shoot a series of targets some five meters away. During the Edo period the Takadanobaba area was a training ground for equestrianism and Yabusame, hence its name ( means “hippodrome”). The stamp gives a real sense of the impressive horsemanship in the station’s history. The scene here is of a Edo Bakufu riflemen regiment festival that happens every two years at the Kaichu Inari Shrine, west of Shin-Okubo Station. The festival uses arquebus with actual gunpowder and takes place every year in late September. Shinjuku — used daily by 3.26 million passengers, recognized by the Guinness World Records as the busiest station on the globe. Covering an area so vast it is at times more like a fortress than a railway terminus, the image of the station on the stamp is utterly unrecognizable to Shinjuku today. The station was completed in 1885, when initially it saw a much more modest fifty passengers per day. The tower defining the stamp design here is the NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building. Yoyogi Station is the closest station to Meiji Shrine’s Jingukitasando, but Meiji Shrine in fact is so large there are two other stations (Harajuku, Sangubashi) closer to different parts. This district is the center of youth fashion in Tokyo. The motif on the stamp is the wooden station building, but unlike Otsuka, Harajuku’s structure still stands. It was completed in 1924 and it the oldest station building in Tokyo. Here we can see Konno Hachimangu Shrine, five minutes’ walk from Shibuya Station’s east exit and the oldest wooden building in Shibuya ward. The station name comes from Yebisu Beer, made and sold by Japan Beer Brewery Company (now merged with Sapporo Beer), and the stamp shows the statue of the god Ebisu that you can find just outside the station’s west entrance. Be sure to stamp your pass properly so Ebisu looks nice and dignified! Gotanda’s stamp changed in 2011 to mark the station’s centenary. The cars on the roads look like Microcars! There was also a special centenary stamp so we stamped both! In contrast to Meguro’s pastoral scene, Ozaki’s stamp is super modern. Wow, you can see how the times change. You won’t find this at Ozaki itself, though, since it’s actually Palette Town in Odaiba, the Tokyo Bay development that you can get to from Ozaki. Oh, and Ozaki Station also had a special 111th anniversary stamp so we included that too. Shingawa is again not, as you might think, in Shinagawa ward, but actually lies in Minato ward. Shinagawa-juku was one of the stopping points on the fifty-three stations of the Tokaido Highway , so the stamp features a scene from the famous Hiroshige woodcut print series. It was here that Kaishu Katsu and Saigo Takamori met and agreed on the unconditional (and bloodless) surrender of Edo during the Meiji Restoration. The stamp shows the monument to this epoch-making event. Tower Tokyo may well these days be languishing in the shadow of the newer Tokyo Sky Tree, but in this stamp at least the symbol of the city still looks very impressive. Japan’s first railway started running from here back in 1872. And you can’t think of Shimbashi without thinking of the locomotive that sits in the plaza in front of the station. Here we have not the station but the Kabuki-za theatre, which was re-built for the fifth time and opened again this spring. Unlike the new architecture with its office complex integrated into the theatre, this image nostalgically indulges us with the older version. This is the famous Nijubashi bridge at the Imperial Palace, near to Tokyo Station. See how it is reflected picturesquely in the water of the moat. If you apply in advance you can go across the bridge. The Kanda Matsuri is one of the three great festivals of Tokyo and also one for the three greatest in all Japan. In the stamp you can feel the energy of the festival crowds. Akihabara is a place that attracts many visitors for its unique culture. Some people might find it a bit of a mess, but we think there’s some nice symmetry here, with the parapets of the bridge lighting up the Denki-gai electronics market. Walk eight minutes from the north exit of this station and you come to Yushima Tenjin, the shrine we see here. It is dedicated to the god of scholarship, the poet and courtier Michizane Sugawara. It gets packed with students during the exams season. Our last stop. We wondered if the stamp would be cherry blossoms (Ueno Park is famous for cherry blossom viewing) or a panda (Ueno Zoo, natch). Actually the stamp is rather detailed and shows how the station looked when it first opened in 1883. We’re curious about all the flags and think it makes an interesting comparison with the Shimbashi stamp.","post_categories":["Graphic Design"],"post_tags":["landmarks","stamps","tokyo guide","tokyo guide play","trains-trains-trains"],"date":"August 12, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Tama – the station master cat who raised over $10 million and helped save a train line","content":"In Kinokawa City (Wakayama, Japan) there’s a peculiar train station manned by Tama, a peculiar station master. And “manned” is certainly not the right word because Tama is a cat. And Kishi Station is perhaps the only station in the world where work has been outsourced to our feline friends. The cat’s tale begins in 2003 when a small railroad company, struggling to stay afloat, was consolidated with another railroad company forming Wakayama Electric Railway. One victim of this consolidation was a small cat shelter that was eventually told to vacate the premises in order to make way for new roads leading to train stations. In 2006, the old woman who had looked after the cats approached the president of the railway after an opening ceremony with a desperate plea: to let the cats, who were now facing eviction, live inside the station. “The moment I met eyes with Tama, I was immediately struck with an image of Tama as station master,” recalls Mitsunobu Kojima, of the sudden revelation that would come to transform his railway. Although Kojima had generally been a dog person, he saw Tama as a maneki-neko (literally, beckoning cat), a Japanese lucky charm in the motif of a cat and thought to bring good business. Tama did not disappoint. News of the feline station master was quickly picked up by the press and spread like wildfire. A train line that had been seeing annual decreases in ridership by over 5% suddenly saw a 10% jump in just the first year. The following year in 2008 an article published by Sankei News estimated that an increase in ridership, revenue from memorabilia like photobooks, commercial appearances, as well as a tourism boom was responsible for a combined economic impact of 1.1 billion yen. For her hard work and dedication, in 2008 Tama was promoted to Super Station Master. She was given a brand new window office, a hat with gold lining and a badge. Tama’s annual compensation package includes 1 years’ worth of cat food.

In 1903 the first electric streetcar hit the road. And in Tokyo alone, a vast system of 41 routes once stretching over 130 miles carried people all over the burgeoning city. But with the onset of automobiles, streetcars began to be seen as a contributor to traffic and lines began to shut down. Currently, there are only 19 lines in all of Japan (and only 2 in Tokyo) that make up less than 1% of the country’s vast railroad system. However, that doesn’t mean that streetcars are on a track to existence. In fact, there is something inherently adorable and nostalgic in seeing small streetcars chug through the city. And if you’ve never been on the two in Tokyo – Toden Arakawa Line and Tokyu Setagaya Line – I highly recommend it. It’s a great way to see lots of Tokyo that you would have missed. Many believe that streetcars have the potential to address some of the urban transportation problems that plague our cities. Here are some of them: If you want to explore the last remaining streetcars of Japan, I’ve created a map, pinpointing where each tram runs. Here is a small selection of some of my favorite streetcars: There are currently plans to build a new streetcar in one of the more unlikely of places – the high-end district of Ginza. However, it would be more of a reinstatement than a new build. Fo almost 100 years Ginza’s economy was supported by streetcars. The original horse-drawn streetcars started operations in 1882 and connected Shinbashi with Asakusa. In 1903 they were electrified, and eventually shut down in 1967. But inspired by Hiroshima’s effective streetcars that continue to operate today, plans are now underway to construct a 2.8 km street rail that would connect Ginza with Tokyo’s Harumi District by as early as 2018.","post_categories":["Industrial Design"],"post_tags":["trains-trains-trains"],"date":"August 13, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Casa Sakanoue | a house on a slope","content":"Casa Sakanoue is much more than a house. It’s a gallery, a community center, as well as an event space. It was roughly four years ago when Yuko Manago first had the idea to for a space where people could come look, listen, smell, taste and touch. Having grown up around art and music, Manago’s vision began to take form after she got married gave birth to a child. She decided to reach out to architect Kazuhiko Kishimoto , who she had seen on television once and admired ever since. This is how, back in May of 2013, on a sloped backstreet just off a busy road, Casa Sakanoue quietly opened. From afar the structure, where Manago also lives, appears to be just a large wooden box. But as you approach the structure, they dynamic architecture becomes more apparent. The stilts appear to lift the box into the sky and a large staircase welcomes visitors as it offers glimpses of the inner courtyard. Casa Sakanoue (literally, at the top of a slope) is just off Hiyoshi station, which is about 45 minutes south of central Tokyo. Its strategic location allows access not only to the lush forest behind it, but also views of Mt. Fuji. They’ve hosted everything from Rakugo storytelling to aroma therapy workshops. If you’re looking for a unique space to host your next event, this might be it. A courtyard with a carved out circular bench allows for a more intimate setting.

And it only intensified as we climbed the steps up to the Japan Society gallery space where were busy at work. To be clear, is the name of the art group but it also represents the number of members in the trio. Heat guns hummed, air purifiers roared, and a fan spun as we entered the gallery. “We usually work with the windows open,” explained one of the members, powering down all the motors and removing his face mask. “we’re just not in our normal workspace.” Indeed, this is the first time have set foot on American soil, much less New York. Invited by gallery director Miwako Tezuka to participate in Japan Society’s inaugural residency program, arrived in New York from Fukushima in late June to complete what will be one of their more ambitious pieces using 555 toy figurines – their way of paying homage to New York and its 5 boroughs. “We immediately ran into trouble at customs,” they say, explaining to us that they had been carrying with them a large bulk of their material. “We had a hard time explaining to the customs officers why we were carrying boxes of 500 figurines with us.” (The plan is to purchase the remaining 55 in New York.) The anonymous group is comprised of three individuals in their late 20s with backgrounds in engineering, arts, and advertising. When asked about their anonymous persona, which often becomes associated with counter-culture or protest tendencies, the three glance at each other and chuckle. “It was actually something that was sort of pushed upon us, rather than something we initiated. We’ve always admired the work of industrial design units like Nendo or Tokujin Yoshioka, which are a group of people operating under a single name. It’s common in the design world but not so much in the arts world. So we thought, why not?” And as learned, people are curious about secrets and tend to pay attention more when there is an implied promise of revelation. Watching at work, it’s clear that each has a task – a purpose, if you will, that feels natural and unforced. Their process involves multiple stations where various tasks are performed, each with a scrupulous attention to detail. It begins, of course, with the same thing we all do when we come into possession of a figurine: we assemble it. But this is where the similarities end. The assembled figurines are then taken to station 2 – often the most time-consuming yet invisible step. The figurines are photographed from various angles. Then the name, make, model and other data are logged on a laptop. This data is often aggregated from multiple sources including their own vast knowledge, manufacturer’s websites and, when all else fails, 3rd party fan blogs. All of this meta data is typically displayed as part of the artwork. But for the first time, the group will be generating QR codes for each figurine that will eventually be combined into their work, enabling viewers to scan the code with their cellphone and immediately pull up all the data on each figurine. “This is a ‘bit’,” says one of the members, holding up what is the result of the final station. “It’s the smallest unit of the figurine.” After their data is logged the figurines move on to the final station where they are sliced into small pieces and melted, but with recognizable features like faces or eyes preserved. Surprisingly, the process is entirely an act of non-violence. It’s somewhat of a contradiction, but one that makes complete sense: “we cut the figurines because we like them so much,” explains . “We want to see them reborn into something new and beautiful.” And watching them at work, each slice is gentle, almost ritualistic. And an important part of the ritual is anime, which is usually streaming on their laptop as they work. There’s a serendipitous moment of joy when a character that they’re cutting appears on screen. “Yea, we just get really happy,” they say, laughing. What remains is an elongated cubic rectangle, which the artists refer to as a “bit.” Just like the cubic “bit” is the smallest unit, the QR code they produce is also comprised of cubic dots, each representing the smallest unit of information. The weight of all the bits are added up, often manifesting themselves in the title of the work (ie: “7825g” or “14.2kg”). often create rectangular panel works based on the dimensions of a TV screen. “The 2D world of TV anime is ideal,” they explain, referring to how anime fans perceive the figurine characters. “If they could, the fans would live inside these 2D worlds. But instead they accept the 3D figurines as the next best thing.” The TV screen represents the final frontier – a monumental, immovable force the separates the 2D and 3D worlds. When you think about it, it’s a fascinating cycle: a 2D character is turned into a 3D figurine, which is then once again reduced into fundamental, raw material. Or, to borrow the words of , “the smallest unit of information.” Despite the often political and cultural critiques embedded in three’s work , their harshest critics have emerged from an unlikely place – an online community of anime fans who view ‘s work as defacing their beloved dolls. When their work began circulating on 2ch, a popular online posting board whose community is often perceived as introverted otaku, the barrage of hate comments were immediate and toxic. “You’re crazy. You’re stupid. You should die. When we used soy sauce containers people commended us for turning garbage into art. But this time they told us that we’re turning art into garbage.” But as most online scuffles go, the confrontation was limited to the computer screen. “It’s almost as if they [the haters] view these figurines as their own wives. So when they see us cutting them up they are naturally upset. But I would love for them to come to our gallery opening so we could have that talk. I would try to explain to them that I like them so much and that’s why I cut them.”  There is a certain child-like honesty in the work of . Watching them assemble, study and then disassemble the figurines is like watching a child work through a puzzle. At times they appear to be in search of a larger answer — in search of their true selves.  And at other times they seem merely focused on the task at hand. If you happen to be in New York, you can come meet the artists at Japan Society on Saturday, July 27 at noon. Also stay tuned as the group plans to reveal their work in an exhibition slated to run from August 27 – October 13.

This week the French design company Orée introduces their portable wireless keyboard to Japan in their first open workshop of this kind. Otherwise available for purchase online, the pop-up shop allows customers the opportunity to customize their keyboard with a choice of fonts and engraving, but the real treat is being able to select your piece of wood. Each keyboard is made from a single board, so grain lines that continue across the keys and shell can be striking. According to designer Franck Fontana, customer preferences vary greatly and some visitors spend hours deliberating over their choices. Once the tough decisions are made, however, engraving takes only about 20 minutes. The company plans to offer other tech products made of natural materials. Wood for these keyboards is sourced in the French Alps, and the accompanying cases are made from recycled pressed leather and natural latex. Over time the wood keyboards change slightly, becoming glossy and in effect, growing with its user. The only problem is that your keyboard will eventually reveal how often you’re using that delete key.

His latest work titled “Galaxy” was produced in just 3 minutes. With a few sprays and a couple dabs of the fingers, Tomoya creates a mesmerizing landscape of a Galaxy that seems like it’s right out of a science fiction movie. “Galaxy” is especially meaningful because in Japan yesterday was the Tanabata star festival in which 2 lovers, Orihime and Hikoboshi (represented by the stars Vega and Altair) are allowed to meet only once a year on July 7th.

After completing her highly acclaimed series “CANARY” in 2007, Shiga quietly ventured off into Kitakama, a remote part of Miyagi prefecture. Her goal was to not only photograph this isolated village – a population of about 320 – but to assimilate, converting from stranger to villager and in turn revealing the town’s hidden stories. The fact that Shiga’s work was inclusive of the 3/11 earthquake and tsunami, rather than responsive to it, makes the photos all the more poignant and powerful. Shiga’s photographs – all 240 of them – were exhibited in a swirling pattern, allowing visitors to weave through them as they please.

Don’t confuse it with mokumoku, which has similar connotations but refers specifically to movement, while the latter is grounded in the realm of motionless. It’s an important distinction to make when referring to New York-based Japanese artist Natsuko Hattori , who creates large, stationary sculptures from soft, huggable and colorful balls of fabric. “Fabric is my medium of choice because people everywhere can relate more easily to this material, which conveys warmth, natural softness and the intimate human touch,” says Hattori. And it’s the act of wrapping that is central to her sculptures. “The gesture of wrapping each round ball, is an act of transformation that converts pain, sadness and despair into positive energy, such as love or a prayer for comfort.” But for her recent work, Hattori has, in the truest sense, embraced the comforting qualities of her own art, working herself into her sculptures. In two pieces titled “Birth” and “Offering of flowers,” Hattori appears immersed in sensual fabric, surrounded by her balls of fabric. “My work conveys a sense of happiness,” explains Hattori, “and it celebrates the human spirit.”","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["fabric","installation"],"date":"July 10, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Studio Visit With Artist Shinji Murakami","content":"Maps. Zelda. Street Art. Pixels. Brooklyn. This is Shinji Murakami ’s world, where real-life graffiti and nostalgic 8-bit games whimsically collide. And it’s all happening in Bushwick, a neighborhood of Brooklyn that has been home to graffiti artists who come from all over the world to leave their mark. Walking down the streets covered in graffiti is a little like slipping back into the 80s. What’s not like slipping back into the 80s is passing by groups of tours, each led by a guide who is explaining the symbolism of the colorful murals to groups of tourists. “I grew up in the 80s,” Murakami explained, as he welcomed us into his artist loft – a shared space in an old industrial building on Bogart St. He pulled out a large stack of game strategy guides, known as , and spread them out on a large white table that sat as an island in the middle of the studio. “I’m from a generation that grew up pouring over these. I studied the maps carefully, figuring out where I should go, where I should level up, which boss I should go fight.” Understanding Murakami’s love for games is crucial to understanding his artwork, which began with creating maps much like the ones he had spent endless hours in as a child. But at age 33, Murakami’s level grinding doesn’t happen in a video game. It happens in his studio and on the street.  Shinji’s inspiration to become an artist came from an unlikely place – dinosaurs. When watching Jurassic Park, he became interested in CG effects and decided he wanted to go to school and learn how to create them. But forced to start in 2D using photoshop and illustrator, Shinji discovered that he also had an affinity for street-style lettering that often appeared in clubbing event fliers. He decided to make the jump from Osaka to Tokyo to apply for a position at a graphic design studio. Unfortunately, he wasn’t accepted. So he turned to the street where the only prerequisites were spray cans and a blank canvas.”At the time I also had a coincidental encounter with Kami-san, a graffiti artist that I had admired. This pushed me to begin making my own art.”  Street art has to be simple and impactful. And the most important element is speed. The shape and form of Shinji’s bokochan character was born from Shinji’s own arm span, but also from his ability to produce it hastily onto a wall. For the most part, the same holds true for many of Shinji’s characters he later went on to create.  Ultimately, Shinji wants to create art that’s accessible to a broad audience. Art that people can appreciate, even without any knowledge or history of gaming. “I don’t want to be pigeonholed as the game guy.” And it’s something that’s pushed – or you might say pulled – his work since he was on the streets of Tokyo. “A lot of the street artists would just tag their name. To them it meant everything but to others it meant nothing. It was just ugly and I hated it.” This might also explain Murakami’s tendency towards simplicity: stripping down all the unnecessary elements. “I want a grandmother and her young granddaughter to walk by my art and be able to say, ‘it’s so cute!’”    Shinji was very active in the Tokyo graffiti scene but wasn’t making the connection. There was something missing and, in search of it he decided to take a 2 week trip to NY. He was shocked and and inspired by the large Chelsea galleries and the Thursday evening parties in which gallery revelers poured out into the street. “I remember being surprised by the use of 3D graphics and typography in movie ads and TV commercials,” Shinji recounts, having only worked in 2D up until then. It was around that time when he made his first foray into the world of 3D, creating an 8-bit version of a McDonalds meal. Shinji is still evolving and experimenting, in search of his place in the art world. He recalls reading an interview with Takashi  Murakami, who had dispensed some very memorable advice: if you want to become big, pick a broad theme that anyone can understand like life and death, or eroticism. “I wanted to create bitmap art but I also wanted to do something erotic,” Shinji recalls. One day those two ideas collided. “This is Janet Jackson, Kim Kardashian, and Paris Hilton. I found them online. I’m in search of Britney spears right now,” he chuckled. Last year as part of City Drift , curator Eri Takane challenged a group of artists to do something they had never done before based on the theme of scent. Shinji went out and bought vanilla essence and bubble mix, seeing what would happen if he combined the two. “I spent too much money testing it,” Shinji laughs. “I just wanted to make people happy.” And happy they were. Vanilla scented bubbles wafted through Bushwick, converting the streets into candy shops and visitors into participants as they “drifted” through, seeking out the origin of the sweet smell. Although Shinji has invested the most time in his maps and considers them the pillar of his portfolio, it’s been his more spontaneous pieces that have received the most response. When first setting about creating his staged portraits of people walking his 8-bit dog, “Puppy.” He posted an ad on craigslist for a young woman model, thinking he would follow the typical archetype of art history. But Shinji became worried that the composition would look too much like a boring fashion ad. So at the last minute he posted another ad on craigslist, this time for an older woman (he had to turn down the 200 who responded to his first ad).  It was the last day of Bushwick Open Studios. Feeling unsatisfied, Shinji was racking his brains for an idea when it hit him. He dashed out of his studio and over to Office Depot where he bought 56 cardboard boxes and several rounds of packaging tape. At a time when most artists were packing up and closing their doors, Shinji hastily assembled his sculpture. When it was done, “Huge Puppy” stood at over 10 ft high. That evening Shinji kicked off phase II by spray-painting the word “ARIGATO” on the side and leaving the spray paint on the sidewalk. When he returned less than 30 minutes later it had been re-edited and re-mixed by someone. “It’s exactly what I wanted,” said Shinji with a sigh of relief. Most recently, Puppy was  part of the SCOPE Art Fair in Basel, Switzerland, curated by Tinca Art. This marked Shinji’s first appearance in an art fair. Puppy, with it’s cute, short legs, is certainly traveling far!

If you don’t know, cosplay refers to the act of dressing up as a fictional character. It’s often practiced in groups  and its influence stretches far beyond Japan (you know this if you’ve ever been to any Japanese festival anywhere outside Japan). Next month photographer Yuji Susaki ‘s tantalizing photos will take center stage in a solo exhibition at Emon Photo Gallery in Tokyo. Susaki, who has spent the last fifteen years examining the relationship between eroticism and disguising oneself, describes cosplayers as novel, yet somewhat pensive. Mischievous yet unique and charming. “His models are sparsely adorned with only the key elements of each persona to create a “less is more” interpretation of cosplay that seeks to provoke an evolution of Japanese fetishism itself,” says the gallery. One of the most popular manifestations of cosplay in Japan is the maid, and subsequent maid cafes in which customers are served food and drinks by girls dressed as maids. Critical theorist Azuma Hiroki describes the phenomenon as an “animalization” of the body. But you don’t need to have a degree in critical theory to understand Susaki’s work, which cuts through jargon and focuses on the essence of cosplay. “The true enjoyment of maid cafes,” said Kiyoshi Hayakawa, founder of the Hayakawa publishing house, “is seeing the fictional characters of manga and anime come to real life.” “COSPLAY made in Japan” is on display from August 24 – September 14, 2013. source: submission","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["cleavage","cosplay","girls"],"date":"July 11, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Cool down with Yutaka Sone’s crystal carved snowflakes","content":"It’s going to be a hot week in New York – brutally hot.

Since the mid-2000s the 48-year old Japanese artist and sculptor has been carving massive snowflakes out of single blocks of crystal in an ongoing series titled “Every Snowflake has a Different Shape.” After microscopically observing a large number of snowflakes and confirming that, indeed, no snowflake is identical, Sone created his own snowflakes based on his own imagination. In his flakes lie the possibility that they may someday appear in future snowfall. If they do, I suppose we can only hope that it will be in the middle of July.

In other words, they offered an effective, aesthetically pleasing solution to closing off spaces that maybe you didn’t want your guests to see. However, the specialized nature of carefully crafted shoji screens have kept them out of houses not equipped with the right beams and railings to accommodate them. That is, until now.

He has taken the concept of Bed, Bath and Beyond quite literally by creating an actual light source with water streaming from the edge of the showerhead/lampshade. Granted, the “ WaterDream ” is not going to be hitting stores anytime soon. It’s a conceptual piece meant to challenge our archetypes and expand the way we think about showering. It was created for Axor, a German brand that “has been developing alternative visions for the bathroom as a living space.” “The natural coming-together of light and water is freed from spatial constraints: what traditionally took place in separate rooms – reading under a lamp in the living room, taking a shower in the bathroom – can now be experienced free from spatial allocations or confinements,” says Philippe Grohe, head of Axor.

According to Shirosaka Inc., a company that aggregates beauty salon data in Japan (yes, that exists), the number of shops have been on a steady rise ever since they began tracking data in 1970. Over the last 40 years the number of beauty salons have more than doubled, from around 100,000 to 223,000 in 2011. And it’s not just in the numbers. Every time I visit Japan a fast food shop or a flower shop has closed down, only to be replaced by a beauty salon. Meanwhile, Japan is seeing one of the most rapid declines in population of any country on earth. Then why are there so many beauty salons, you might wonder? The reasons are vast and varied and includes a large number of beauticians who leave their nest to start their own shop, but also an ongoing trend in which young Japanese men try to resemble their female counterparts. So to survive in such a harsh market, beauty salons have taken to creative means to lure customers, often enlisting architects and designers to help create an ideal environment that will win over clients. In a short series, we explore recent trends in beauty salon architecture – a field that has uniquely evolved in Japan. “I wanted to create a be-all and end-all beauty salon for our clients,” says Yuki Shirasawa, who explains the name behind her beauty salon “ End…Link ,” which she started 6 years ago in Osaka. But as her business grew, so did her team and the time came to move into a larger space. So Shirasawa went about locating a address. She decided on a 90ft-deep space in central Osaka. Yasunari Tsukada , the designer who helped create her first space, was brought back on board. “The scope of what I design isn’t fixed. I think about all things and objects on the same plane as possible targets for design, and constantly think about what it means to ‘design’ something,” says Tsukada, who came up with a creative solution to utilize the elongated space. Inspired by the rawness and flexibility of a jungle gym, Tsukada decided to install architectural wooden lattice screens on one wall. Providing only a structural framework, the lattice takes on various functions, acting as display shelves and tables, but also helping to define the space without the use of partitions, which tend to be isolating.","post_categories":["Uncategorized"],"post_tags":["architecture-beauty-salons"],"date":"June 24, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Pacific Dazzle baton | a hillside oasis in the city","content":"Pacific Dazzle is a small company that operates 5 beauty salons in the Kansai area – 3 in Hyogo and 2 in Osaka.

He began by creating an exterior façade lined with protruding planters at various levels so that visitors are at once greeted by plants and greenery. Once inside, a fountain, green walls and strategically placed trees help stage a dynamic performance that transports visitors to a hillside oasis.

It was located on an incredibly large 6-lane street that also sandwiched a street car. 10 years in the owner decided it was time the look of his shop also represent his philosophy. So they hired architect Tsubasa Iwahashi and, for 2.5 weeks, closed up shop to undergo a renovation. On March 30, 2013, they reopened as “ folm arts beauty salon ” (it’s not clear whether the misspelling of “form” was intentional) with a sleek, minimal façade that countered the busyness of the surrounding area. A house-shaped entrance greets customers, who are then led into a tranquil, white space that’s divided into different areas: reception, styling and a hidden station for beauty treatments in the very back. Wooden panels and built-in storage for magazine racks complements the white, cubic form.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["architecture-beauty-salons"],"date":"June 25, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Treasure hunting in the woods | Onico is a kid-friendly hair salon","content":"Earlier this year a new hair salon opened in Kamishinden, just North of Osaka City. Onico was designed by Ryo Isobe , an Osaka-based architect who specializes in beauty salons. Isobe worked with the owner to create custom antique and DIY furniture, including mirrors, lighting and display boards. “We don’t just make things look pretty. We design user experience,” says Isobe, who goes on to explain that he imagined Onico as a woodland filled with whimsical curiosities. The space is filled with birch trees wedged between the floor and ceiling. And dotted throughout are odd objects like a stuffed owl. It’s as if you’re going on a treasure hunt through the woods. The antiquey look makes it seem very delicate and not kid friendly, right? Well you’d be surprised to learn that kids are more than welcome. In fact, they even have a room where kids can hang out and wait for their parents. Now that’s a cool idea.

IRO, which literally means color, boasts a minimal interior that has been stripped of all bells and whistles. Bare concrete, wood and brick come together to complete the space, thanks to architect Reiichi Ikeda . One unique property that runs consistently throughout IRO, which opened in April of 2012, is the diagonally placed wood paneling, which compliments the diagonal stripes on the frosted window. These are placed at an exact angle of 23.43 degrees, which just happens to be the same axis that the earth is rotating on. The artfully designed logo by Yuma Harada follows the same concept, with the O rotated to be in line with earth. And IRO has a secondary meaning, referring to the different shades and colors created by the seasons. “The light streaming through the diagonal lines and its shadows shifts from season to season,” explains the architect.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["architecture-beauty-salons","earth"],"date":"June 26, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Projection Mapping FTW | Perfume performs at the Cannes Lions","content":"Last week marked the 60th Cannes Lion International Festival of Creativity in Cannes, France, where the best of the best creative advertising is honored.

But Toya managed to differentiate himself as a fine artist, bringing with him the post-Mono-ha art movement. Like the original Mono-ha movement, the group of artists used elements of nature and a minimal zen aesthetic but introduced a fresh artistic process of reasserting the hand of the artist. In Toya’s case, the primal force of the chainsaw is clearly evident in the scars of the wood, but only to a certain extent. In other cases it’s almost hard to believe that the intricate relief carvings were done with something like a chainsaw. Three elements are always found in Toya’s works: sculpture, fire and colour. After his sculptures are carved, Toya uses ash to apply color to certain parts of the wood like a painter.

It’s not a 3D model. ” “ a hyper-realistic bust of the Great Emancipator. ” “ it’s a little bit shocking! ” Yes, the interwebs have been stirring all week as we ogled over Japanese make-up artist Kazuhiro Tsuji’ s sculpture of Abraham Lincoln. Indeed, it’s as if a photographer traveled 150 years back in time and took photos of our 16th president. Tsuji’s creation, which stands at the same height as the actual man, is currently part of the Life and Times of Abraham Lincoln exhibit at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Library, open to the public until September 30, 2013. And as incredible as the sculpture is, tsuji’s story is equally awe-inspiring. As it turns out, the story – call it the parable of Uncle Abe – has its roots in Lincoln. As a child Tsuji had always been interested in making things, often spending hours at junkyards picking up treasures. And with no money to go to college, Tsuji was not left with many options as high school came to an end. But when he came across an issue of Fangoria magazine featuring Dick Smith (“the Godfather of makeup”) it solidified his ambitions and his future – he would become a makeup artist. Detailed in the magazine was Dick Smith applying make-up to Hal Holbrook to play Lincoln in the 1976 TV mini series of the same name. (Holbrook won an Emmy for his portrayal and Spielberg later honored him by casting him in a small roll in his 2012 biopic) Inspired by the craftsmanship, Tsuji scrapped together the little money he had made from working at a bakery. “I took a life cast of myself and attempted to transform myself into Lincoln, which was all the more difficult considering I’m Japanese,” Tsuji recalled. He sent photos to Dick Smith, whose PO box he had found in the magazine, and quickly received a response. It wasn’t a golden ticket to willy wonka’s but it was enough to establish a relationship, and the two began to correspond regularly. As if traveling on a trajectory of collision, Several months later the two met when Dick Smith traveled to Japan to work on Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s Sweet Home, a horror flick produced by the legendary Juzo Itami. The relationship blossomed and Smith subsequently offered Tsuji a position working with him on the film. After working in the industry for several years in Japan Tsuji was invited to the States where he joined Cinovation Studios, headed by multi-Oscar winner Rick Baker. The rising star quickly turned heads and by age 26 was given major roles like doing the special effects for Men In Black.   “Maybe Dick’s portrait,” said Tsuji, contemplating what his proudest work might be. “It was the first project where I had complete freedom.” In discussing his hyper realism that has everyone amazed, Tsuji had this to say: “basically, our job is recreating nature and our art is realism. What nature can do is simply amazing. It is impossible to create something better than nature can. So we are more like interpreters or translators. A good artist knows the subtlety and language of nature.”   source: if.co.au | LA Times | Kazuhiro Tsuji","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["effects","Hollywood","makeup","realistic"],"date":"June 14, 2013"},{"author":"Maddie","title":"A renovated home for two families  by Yasunari Tsukada","content":"Yasunari Tsukada established his Osaka design firm in 2012 and tackled his first independent project renovating a residential home.

And one of the most popular ways is to have the heat scared out of you is to head to a haunted house, many of which are only open during the summer. This year we’re rounding up some of our favorites that offer, well, let’s just say a different kind of horror. Part performance art, park shock art and all parts weird, Gokiburi Combinato (abbreviated Gokicon) promise a spectacle unlike any other. But this is one show you’ll want to leave the kids at home for. Gokicon are known for incorporating nudity, fetishes and sadistic tendencies into their bizarre performances. And at 1500 yen, it’s the most expensive on our list. (PS you’ll want to wear clothes that you won’t mind getting dirty) Dates: June 22-25, 2013 Time: 4pm-7pm (Jue 23 from 1pm) Venue: Vanilla Gallery Price: 1500 yen  For a special haunted house exhibition just for kids, the Museum of Contemporary Art Toky o is putting a moratorium on the 3 rules they typically enforce on their little visitors: no running, no touching, no playing. The exhibition will be designed by Torafu Architects and will be centered around Sakurako Hamaguchi’s “Ghost, Underpants and Stars” (オバケとパンツとお星さま) and other kid-friendly artwork. According to the curators, ghosts represent creativity and curiosity, underpants represents the growth process (ie: graduating from diapers) and stars represent fantasy. Together, they make up 3 keywords that tickle a child’s imagination. Dates: June 29- September 8, 2013 (closed Mondays) Time: 10am-6pm Venue: Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo Price: 1000 yen general admission The Daiba Haunted School is based on an urban legend about a student who committed suicide. The school was then plagued by odd disturbances and disappearances, eventually getting shut down. The haunted house has been the target of criticism due to its portrayal of suicide for entertainment purposes. But the production agency has countered by saying they donate a portion of their profits to an anti-suicide hotline.

It was chilly but in his sun-drenched apartment where he was solemnly working on a 12″ jacket cover for an upcoming album, it felt like early summer. The sought-after designer has been tapped by big names like Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, Dell, Raf Simons, Adidas, Kidrobot, Ace Hotel and many many more. His stylistically detailed illustrations are mechanical and controlled, yet thoroughly chaotic. We were interested in learning more about him, his work, and what makes him tick as a designer. Kenzo grew up in Hyogo, a Western prefecture of Japan dominated by heavy industries. His father owned small factory and, partially raised by factory workers himself, Kenzo grew up watching people build things with oily, greasy, machines. A dedicated worker, his dad took only 3 days off out of the entire year during new year’s so on weekends Kenzo and his brother would stay with their father at the factory. Have you always had long hair?  Actually there was a brief period when my hair was even longer. It was when I had moved to San Diego. But I had this bad habit. I would go out, get drunk, come home and think, ‘I’m going to cut my hair.’ No more drunk hair cutting. He attended Kwansei Gakuin, a protestant private High School and University, and immersed himself in his studies. To enter the school, He even subjected himself to some particularly strict regiments when he was a Junior High School student. During the summer he would enroll in intense studies at a cram school summer training camp at a temple where corporal punishment was an accepted form of discipline. “We had to sign a contract saying that we couldn’t sue even if we were physically injured by the punishments,” which included hitting and dumping cold water on students. The curriculum called for 40 minutes of study, followed by 10 minutes of test-taking. If you didn’t pass you had to retake it, but at night. Failing meant sleep deprivation. Once during an exam Kenzo drifted into unconsciousness while his hand apparently kept moving. At the end of the period he handed in a completed exam. Surprisingly, he scored 25% (“it should have been a zero, since I blacked out the entire time.”) but it was his nonsensical, delusional answers that alerted the staff. “My teacher called me in and told me to sleep,” Kenzo chuckled. “You know how when you’re on the phone and doodling you do something half unconscious and something really good comes out? The trick for me is to bring myself to that place, but very intentionally,” Kenzo later said, reflecting on his process. After spending almost a year in San Diego, studying English and preparing his portfolio to get into Parsons, he made the jump. While in school, Kenzo’s first real gig was creating set designs for a film director known as Voltaire. And before he had graduated he had become a partner at a broadcast design firm, where he eventually spent 7 years working on TV productions. Despite being a wonderful learning experience, the mentality began eating at him. “The concept would always start out really cool and everyone was motivated. But 6 months down the road it’s just a hot girl dancing and a logo. When you know your 100% scotch is going to get watered down, you stop serving the real stuff. And I realized that I was starting to give them the watered down stuff from the beginning of the process and I saw the huge danger in where I was heading.” What does it mean to be a professional?  If you think hard enough and have enough time, anyone can come up with a cool idea. Being professional means coming up with cool ideas and you can execute them on time. Also, knowing what to spend time on and what not to. If you have to plant a forest but are obsessing over 1 tree when time does not allow you to be, that forest is not going to happen. A turning point for Kenzo came in 2002. The event was that Nike commissioned him to do a mural for their first art space project in NYC. But the chain reaction reads like a lesson in serendipitous causality. Kenzo was living with 2 roommates on Mott St. One of them was Mandy Coon, the fashion designer. While on tour with her all-girl electroclash band W.I.T, Mandy gave one of Kenzo’s stickers he had created to a friend, Matt Clark, who was behind the Seattle-based Houston . Matt was also working for Nike at the time and took an interest in Kenzo’s work. “It was one of those projects that, while you’re doing it, you think, this is going to change my career.”   Where do you get your inspiration?  I love watching movies with director commentary. Listening to how other people work is inspiring. Actually, designing is a lot like acting. When I’m working on something dark, I’m playing the role of dark graphic designer, listening to Nick Cave. But when working on happier projects I’m listening to disco, like the Bee Gees. But that role that I play has nothing to do with my everyday life. So do you watch a lot of movies?  Yes Favorite movie?  Anything by Woody Allen   Can you tell us a little about your fashion philosophy?  I always travel with necktie. As a man, when you travel in a suit and tie… it makes your life so much easier. Also, when you travel it’s a constant collection of 1st impressions. And that’s all you get. So might as well make the best impression. Fashion icon?  My grandpa is 95 and still works in factory. He wears a suit and tie every day. He’s from a generation that dresses proper no matter where you go. He’s not really my style icon but it’s more of his philosophy that appeals to me. So now I always put tie on for workdays. Do you have a dream collaborator?  I’ve done so many collaborations with big name brands and corporations but I also would like to work with the people around me. There are so many great people that I run into and think are on same wavelength. People like Christian Joy . As usual, my son Huey (6) had some questions for Minami.

Fuji","content":"According to legend, Mt. Fuji used to be the abode of a fire goddess who would be jealous of any other woman in the vicinity.  Mt. Fuji, as it appears on Japan’s 1000 yen note, is a view from Lake Motosu and is based on a photograph by Koyo Okada, in which he captured Mt. Fuji’s upside down reflection in the lake. Although this is somewhat of a rumor, during WWII the CIA briefly considered dropping buckets of red paint on Mt. Fuji as a form of psychological warfare to degrade Japan’s morale. However, a more thorough analysis revealed that it would require 12 tons of paint and roughly 30,000 B29 planes to carry all the paint and the plan was quickly dropped. Although the mountain itself sits on the boundary between Shizuoka and Yamanashi prefectures, a 1974 Supreme Court ruling stated that all land above station 8 (roughly 400 m2) belongs to a sacred shrine. Due to popular demand, and in an attempt to stimulate the local economy, Shizuoka prefecture created a Mt. Fuji license plate in 2008. It’s available in 6 different districts and has become a collectable for Mt. Fuji aficionados. Seicho Matsumoto’s 1960 novel “Tower of Waves” (波の塔) detailed the love affair of a woman and prosecutor up until their untimely death at the end when they commit suicide in Aokigahara forest. The deep “sea of trees” had long been associated with spirits but in 1974 a women hung herself with the book, kicking off a sad and terrible spree. Here’s a good 20-minute documentary about a man who walks the forest trying to prevent people from taking their lives. In the 1960s Fuji Kyuko had plans to bore a tunnel through the south-west side of the mountain with a cable car that would take you to the summit in just under 13 minutes. Although the plan was shot down by conservationists, they did have a catchy slogan: to the summit of Mt. Fuji and back in heels.

For 600 days Yu Yamauchi lived in a hut near the summit of Mt. Fuji, getting up while it was still dark to photograph the sunrise every day, from the same location. The resulting series, titled “DAWN,” is a stunning look at the colorful, sometimes abstract view of Earth waking up. What’s perhaps most striking about the series is the variability. Not a single picture looks the same. And yet, each day the sun, rising from the same spot, repeats itself.  ","post_categories":["Events"],"post_tags":["Mt.

Fuji","content":"Just like there are many categories of photographers – nature, portrait, street – so too exist a microcosm of Mt. Fuji photographers, each who have carved out a niche for themselves after what is presumably many years of photographic study directed at Fuji. The subcategories are as diverse as its subject matter: a mountain, yes. But so much more than just a mountain. Here are some of them: Mt. Fuji with clouds is known, amongst a select few, as Kumofuji (雲富士). “Mt. Fuji remains the same yet the clouds and light are continuously changing,” says Koichi Shimano. “Every time I look at it I see something new, which is why I continue to photograph Kumofuji. Close-ups are always nice. But there is a distinct group of photographers who find pure joy in the challenge of photographing Mt. Fuji from far, far away. Here are some of the farthest possible locations to shoot Mt. Fuji. For those who love city life (and see no reason to leave), photographing Mt. Fuji behind a landscape of office buildings and high-rises is just the thing. Everything looks better in a frame. Or at least that’s what “tunnel Fuji” photographers will tell you. This select breed enjoys seeing Mt. Fuji through tunnels, sculptures, gates and other man-made objects. The thrill is not so much rooted in the mountain itself, but in a physical location irreplicable anywhere else. Combine trainspotting with a love for Mt. Fuji and you’ve got Fujimieki, or train stations where you can see Mt. Fuji. The term also applies to spotting Mt. Fuji from trains. Did you know that there are 678 train stations where you can see Mt. Fuji from? It’s true. In fact, there is a website (JP) dedicated to archiving photos and their trains stations.

In fact, one of the pillars of Japan’s indigenous religion Shintoism is yaoyorozu no kami (八百万の神), or “eight million gods” that reside on objects of nature like mountains, trees and waterfalls. So with a larger-than-life entity like Mt. Fuji, grounded in a regal self-assurance like a border town sheriff, it’s easy to understand the type of presence the mountain commanded. And like other divine entities, Mt. Fuji was often depicted in art. Interestingly, early depictions were based only on rumors and exaggerated tales that were carried to cities by word of mouth. It wasn’t until the Kamakura Period (1185 – 1333) when the bakufu military government was installed that travel became more popular and artists began creating more accurate depictions of Mt. Fuji. Another significant change occurred during the Edo Period (1603 – 1868). Peaceful times brought more travel and, for the first time, people began to travel to Mt. Fuji and climb for pleasure, rather than spiritual enlightenment. A standardized currency also enables Ukiyo-e artists to travel to Mt. Fuji, opening the doors to more original interpretations of the mountain. Mt. Fuji in art shifted from being a scenic part of the background to the foreground where it began to play a protagonistic role.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["Mt.

Contrary to what most of us would do – avoid it like the plague – he picked it up, took it home and removed its bones. This, says Tokushige, an artist originally trained in photography, was how he began creating floral sculptures using dead animal bones and skin. “We’ve been creating paintings and sculptures for over 70,000 years and our relationship to bones is just as old,” explains Tokushige. “Everything around us – clothes, nuclear power plants, internet – can be traced back to the structure of bones.” Tokushige began to take an interest in our inherent connection to bones, but also the relationship between death and flowers, which has an equally long history of being associated with one another. When Neanderthal bones were excavated scientists discovered traces of pollen around the bones, indicating that even back then flowers were used to celebrate the deceased. “We don’t come in contact with bones anymore,” says Tokushige. “And yet we all will one day become bones and return to the earth. Perhaps by returning to a fundamental state of mind and contemplating bones we can learn something about ourselves.” After photographing his sculptures Tokushige returns the bones to the earth. We saw how flowers can be used to create bones . It’s interesting to see it the other way around.

But with major companies like Hilton and West Paces pouring money into the region and rebranding hotels and villages with their name, Kengo Kuma decided it was important to maintain local identity. Paying homage to the indigenous Ainu tradition of using the entire body of wood for their homes, Kuma used hundreds of large slabs of wood, paneling them throughout the interior and exterior of the hotel. In the lobby area the slits even act as magazine racks. “We wanted a space that is deeply related to the history of this place – the culture of Ainu,” says Kuma. “The Ainus worship nature and believe a spirit resides in every single tree.” ","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["architecture-hospitality"],"date":"May 14, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Call For Entries | You Fab 2013 Laser Cutter Contest","content":"For the 2nd year in a row, Loftwork and FabCafe are hosting their You Fab laser cutter competition .

Fuji 101 | A beginner’s guide","content":"Surrounded by blue sky, topped with white snow and standing at 3776 meters, Mt. Fuji is perhaps the single most revered national landmark of Japan. Over 300K people climb Japan’s highest peak each year. I did it with my Mom many years ago and will adhere to the oft-quoted saying – a wise man climbs Mount Fuji once in his life; only a fool climbs it twice. But that doesn’t mean I don’t continue to look. The many faces of Mt. Fuji have not only inspired climbers, but photographers, painters, sculptors and musicians. There are even Mt. Fuji otaku who hastily snap their cameras at the sight of the mountain out of train windows. And now the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO is set to approve Mt. Fuji as a World Heritage site when it meets in June. To commemorate this official global recognition, we’re running a week-long series of posts JUST on Mt. Fuji! Here are a few Mt. Fuji basics to get us in the mood. Can I make a day trip out of climbing Mt. Fuji?  Absolutely. There are several different routes with varying difficulties/lengths but each should get you to the top and back in a single day. The shortest Fujinomiya Route will get you from station 5 to the summit in roughly 5 hours. But beware – during peak season this is also the most crowded route. When can I make the climb  Any day of the year you wish. However, official climbing season is July and August. This means that weather will be more favorable but congestion will not. What do I need to bring?  There can be dramatic swings in temperature so be sure to dress in layers. A waterproof windbreaker on top is also a good idea. If you’re going to be climbing in the dark to see the sunrise you’ll want a head lamp so you can keep both hands free. Hat, backpack, gloves and shoes that offer plenty of support are also a given. Most supplies like water will be available as you climb but be prepared to pay a hefty premium. So what’s the deal with the huts?  Huts along the way (mostly between station 5 -8) provide meals and lodging for those looking to stay overnight and then continue to the summit early in the morning for the sunrise. Some huts take walk-ins but to play it safe you’ll want to make a reservation. Rates are between 7000 – 9000 yen and include meals. Here is a list of huts and their phone numbers. – Distance: 14km – Time: 6 hours going up, 3 hours coming down – Perhaps the least crowded route and the only route to take you through the forested areas of Mt. Fuji. – Distance: 15.1km – Time: 5.5 hours going up, 3 hours coming down – The most popular of routes. A large parking lot accommodates tour buses and people arriving by car. – Distance: 10km – Time: 5 hours going up, 2.5 hours coming down – If you’re not planning on spending the night, this is the route for you. It’s the fastest route but you also take the same path down (most route have alternate descending routes) so you may have to play a little dodge ball. – Distance: 19.5km – Time: 7.5 hours going up, 3 hours coming down – The most difficult and time-consuming of all routes. It requires more planning as there are no huts or supply stores for a large part of the hike.","post_categories":["Go and See"],"post_tags":["Mt.

New York Flagship Store Now Open in Aoyama","content":"It was an exciting day in Japan’s fashion industry 2 months ago when Thom Browne and his characteristically unique American style arrived, officially, in Japan in the form of a flagship store in Aoyama. Located on the posh Miyuki-dori and surrounded by luminaries like Acne Studios and Mackintosh , the grey, windowless, marble-clad fortress is Browne’s first foray overseas. The only window, in fact, is a narrow, intimidating entrance. The 3-story structure is a full-service boutique offering menswear (1st floor) womenswear (2nd floor) and a made-to-order room in the basement where you can sip a 1996 vintage Dom Pérignon from a tumbler while your measurements are taken. And the style of the building is consistent with the overall theme of his original shop: a late 1950s – early 1960s office where Don Draper types were running around with tie clips and briefcases making business deals. Browne’s vision came to life thanks to Masamichi Katayama from Wonderwall . Browne attributes his dapper look to his father and his chic, effortless, “midcentury cool” design philosophy may very well be best summed up by this simple quote : “When people have too many choices, they make bad choices.” To complete the continental mid-century look are a series of furniture hand-picked from shops like Jacques Adnet, Dunbar, Maison Jansen and Gio Ponti. It’s no surprise that Browne chose Tokyo for his first overseas flagship store. While going from near-obscurity to appearing in Wes Anderson films, runways in Milan and being selected by Michelle Obama to design her dress to be worn to her husband’s inauguration, Browne was quickly gaining momentum in Japan. In 2001 Browne left Club Monaco to launch his own label. But by 2010, when Browne was still working out of a tiny, appointment-only shop, his sales in Japan were rivaling his biggest success story – Bergdorf Goodman. In 2011 Browne also collaborated with Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Garcons. Celebrities and models like Kiko Mizuhara, Kankuro Nakamura, Verbal and Takumi Saito turned out for the opening where Browne noted that he hopes to create an actual experience, rather than just a retail experience. He also spoke of the importance of this Tokyo flagship as a hub for Thom Browne New York style in Asia and the rest of the world. Attendees had the chance to pick up a limited design button-down (50,400 yen) inscribed with the opening line of one of Browne’s favorite poems: The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["Fashion","storefront design","tokyo guide","tokyo guide shop"],"date":"May 6, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"#thatPOWER | Will.i.am’s new music video shot in Tokyo features various architectural landmarks","content":"Last month Will.i.am, the hip-hop bohemian-turned-dancehall-music-captain, unveiled his video for #thatPOWER (embedding disabled), a track from his new album #willpower.

And indeed, funerals in Japan are largely a black & white affair, with any deviation from the code being considered taboo and disrespectful. So when Tokyo-based ad agency I&S BBDO was approached by Nishinihon Tenrei to create an unconventional ad for funeral services, it understandably posed several challenges. “The March 11th earthquake and tsunami had a traumatic effect on Japan. Issues of life and death, hope and despair, beauty and tragedy became an all too real part of people’s everyday lives,” says the agency, reflecting on how to communicate the funeral home’s new role of remembering and celebrating the beauty of a lost person’s life.

With a population density that trumps every other metropolitan city in the world and land prices at a premium, architects are forced to get creative. That’s exactly what architect Kozo Yamamoto did when a client came to him and requested an “open house” with a courtyard and roof terrace.  “Standing on the empty lot and carefully observing ‘open’ spots around it, we began to naturally envision the best locations for the courtyard and roof terrace,” says Yamamoto. This was tricky because the site was located in an area with lax zoning laws, sandwich between buildings of varying heights including a 5-story apartment building. Quite literally thinking out of the box, Yamamoto came up with plans for a triangular courtyard, an L-shaped terrace and a loft space that sits above the kitchen on the first floor. “We made sure that openings are placed at an appropriate height and location so that they can open up the house towards outside while keeping privacy.” ","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["architecture-residential"],"date":"April 19, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"The Canvas Chair Doubles as Both Art and Furniture","content":"Art, for the most part, discourages physical interaction.

Yoshioka has once again returned to what is perhaps one of his favorite meditative studies: the crystal. In fact, one time he even made a chair from crystals he grew himself ! Some believe they balance yin and yang energy, while others claim they bring good luck. But Yoshioka is more interested in the physical, rather than metaphysical, properties of crystal – in this case, their ability to refract light. Collaborating with Italian furniture design company Lema , Yoshioka has designed a collage of mirrored plates. The panels, which can be manipulated and freely arranged into various positions and angles seems at once to be consistent with this year’s theme of kinetic, rather than static furniture. “Mirage” functions both as a mirror, but also as an art piece, and performs in precise yet entirely unpredictable ways. His piece for Glas Italia is also a mirror, albeit a much simpler one. But look closely and you’ll find that it’s embedded with a treasure trove of prior experimentations. Composed of thick, high-transparency glass, the frames are cut to create a shimmering refraction of light.  This bling is not what it appears to be. Created for Kartell , the Italian company that makes plastic contemporary furniture, Yoshioka’s series of stools and side tables look like they belong behind armored glass. But in fact, they’re made from polycarbonate, the clear and nearly unbreakable plastic used to make everything from baby bottles to windows. “Sparkle” is cut in just a way to give it the appearance of crystal glass. And a distinctive twist is given to each piece to further enhance the refraction of light.   Seemingly an outlier, the series of tables for Italian furniture manufacturer Desalto are made from stainless steel and aluminum, a stark visual contrast to the other shiny, delicate-looking pieces. But the genesis of Yoshioka’s collection can actually be found in his experiments growing crystals. Taking his cue from the way naturally occurring crystals are intergrown with adjacent crystals, “Element” is made up of a perpendicular support that attaches itself to a wide base. A table top rests on the structure, forming a precarious balancing act that is, needless to say, molecularly stable.  The one burning question I have (and perhaps the key to understanding Yoshioka’s work) is, who is that mystery woman who appears in almost every single collection!?!","post_categories":["Industrial Design"],"post_tags":["Milano Salone 2013","Tokujin Yoshioka"],"date":"April 9, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Saeri Kiritani Wins 2013 Portrait Competition with Sculpture Made From 100 Pounds of Rice","content":"– Introduction to the National Portrait Gallery’s 2013 portrait competition In what is being called the largest artwork ever made out of rice, Saeri Kiritani , a NY-based artist who originally hails from Kanazawa, has been named one of the winners of the National Portrait Gallery ’s 2013 portrait competition.

I arrived after sunset in the beating heart of Roppongi among Japanese and foreigners, ready to enjoy the night in one of the many surrounding bars and clubs. Roppongi may be the red-light district of Tokyo, but it’s also a budding center of art and design with the National Art center and Tokyo Midtown, home to the Suntory museum,  Design Hub , the Mori museum , PechaKucha refuge , and more. These sites have proved to be valuable spaces for fostering a design-centric community, inspiring artists, designers and thinkers. Despite all it had going for it, I still wasn’t sure about what I would discover. But I pushed forward as my curiosity about sneaking into a museum at night overcame my fear of disappointment. I stepped in. I was far from disappointed! Invested, transformed, vibrating; I hardly recognized the place and its smooth flow of people mixing with artists, musicians and performers. I quickly gave up following the map and agenda offered to me at the information station. There was too much to see, too much to listen, too much to read. Katsuhiko Hibino – artist and director of Roppongi Art Night – succeeded in constructing an uninterrupted network of experiences, one leading to the other. So I set myself loose in a random itinerary and I never felt lost. Roppongi Art Night was just the right illustration of this second kind of art. A kind of art where the spectator is completely integrated. The body is involved and the soul is transformed. Look! Listen! Take! Think! Cry! Dance! Laugh! Here were all the injunctions reaching my head, heart and body. The night gathered a breathtaking array of art and performances. Exhibitions, theater, live painting, concerts, knitting in the park… The night resonated with sounds of “great -sugoi!,” “wonderful – subarashii!” and “cute – kawaii!” coming from an excited crowd delighted by the surprises found in their way.  This installation of a watch or compass arrow pointed to the sky, under which entertaining concerts took place, was a great embodiment of the theme of this night: TRIP. “Witness today’s transformation into tomorrow.” I don’t know about transformation but what I do know is this night filled us all with energy to face tomorrow.

Perhaps most well-known for his collaboration with fashion icon Issey Miyake, Arai’s work is Avant-garde yet stunning. Multi-colored metallic fabrics are suspended and lit so that they seem to be moving like flames or bursting volcanoes. Major works are suspended from the ceiling and visitors are encouraged to meander through and inspect them at all angles. As I snaked my way through the shimmering fabrics I noticed I could see other visitors but they couldn’t see me, like a gold plated one-way mirror. The exhibition also presents videos of Arai explaining his methodologies, which combine handcraft weaving and dying techniques with cutting-edge technology. Some of the most interesting pieces were the shibori style textiles where the metallic-coated threads were melted and removed in some parts of the cloth to leave behind sheer, metal-tinged translucent surfaces.  Arai continues to work and experiment with new technologies, and constructed new pieces specifically for this show. I actually caught a glimpse of him while visiting the exhibition and though he is small in stature, he has plenty to say. The exhibition ARAI Junichi: Tradition and Creation closes this Sunday, March 24 .

Or at least that’s the way it goes in Japan’s housing market where a postwar “Scrap and build” policy has resulted in average home lifespans of just 30 years. Only about 13% of all housing sales are pre-owned homes, compared with about 78% in the U.S. But now an aging population and an imbalance between homes and families has made the government jump ship, reversing their policy and offering incentives for home renovations. And thanks to a popular TV show called “ Before After ,” the general public seems to be warming up to the idea of renovation as well. But it certainly helps when a beautiful example comes along and helps you visualize the potential of, say, a derelict warehouse. Keiichi Kiriyama is a young architect who worked under Makoto Tanijiri and went on to establish his own studio – aptly titled Airhouse – in 2009. In 2012 he renovated a warehouse in the suburban district of Yoro (Gifu prefecture), not too far from the industrial city of Nagoya. Previously used to house farming equipment, Kiriyama injected a dose of calm by inserting a large loft that houses a bedroom and 2 bathrooms.   The loft space above for the kids overlooks the entire home. A major focal point is the kitchen which was designed specifically for the food-loving couple.  source: submission","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["renovation"],"date":"March 26, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Clipnest turns your paper clips into a bird’s nest","content":"Product designer Ryosuke Harashima created this tactile wooden egg embedded with a magnet.

The line between Art and Science is hazy; Artists create – so do Scientists, both research and experiment, gather, present and analyze: both can seem obscure to the man on the street. So what exactly is Bio Media Art? Perhaps one of the biggest questions is whether BioArt is Art that uses biotechnology and living tissues as materials or whether the inclusion of work that borrows from the imagery and language of science can be considered BioArt? This exhibition is more of the latter as the inclusion of the word Media suggests. Perhaps one of the most recognizable and controversial images of “BioArt” is Eduardo Kac’s piece “ Alba ” – a rabbit which was implanted with a jellyfish gene GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) that made it glow green under certain light. For some critics, the idea of using animals and altering them for the sake of Art is unethical. Controversy still surrounds the idea of using living tissue for Science or Art – but for Scientists there is some debate over what matter actually is considered to be alive.    Colombian born but Tokyo based BioArtist Juan Manuel Castro shows impulse (above) – organic micro structures (lipid membranes) that form flexible bio architectures. Developed with Dr Taro Toyota of the University of Tokyo. His installation contains a microscope and various equipment that sit next to a projection of the structures. Speaking to Castro he said “ I am very interested in the possibilities of bio architectures – for me these cells are very beautiful and people do not realize how much beauty there is in nature already, I want to show them”. Bio Media Art is subtler in its approach. The small show is nestled in the corner of the second floor of the multi faceted Arts Center and has been organized with Tama Art University in conjunction with the Tokyo based Iwasaki lab and Metaphorest who hosted the “Godfather” of BioArt – Joe Davis, in 2011. Students exhibit alongside artists such as Waseda University professor and artist Hideo Iwasaki the founder of the Iwasaki Lab and the work is a mix of the conceptual and the visceral. Iwasaki developed his work Biogenic Timestamp: Prototype 2.0 with Oron Catts – it shows the cycle of cyanobacteria, exhibited in a clear glass box, and projected onto the wall we can see one of the earliest forms of life. The bacteria interacts and decomposes within a set of circuitry, here the beginnings of life and the physicality of technology form a new, changing eco-system and an image of the past and the future. Other work feature scientific methodologies with a twist – Kirilian photography capturing the beauty of the shape and form of leaves and water (Wataru Yamamoto 光の葉 /The Light of leaves), Scientific looking drawings document imaginary synthesized plants (Keira Akiyama – Acoustic Botany) seeds make plates (Hana Saito Seed Dish ) and in the corner a small fusen (Soichiro Mihara – Suzu) is connected to a Geiger counter chiming now and then – a reminder of the still unresolved Fukushima nuclear situation. If you are expecting Stelarc like performances then the show might not quite be what you are expecting. Japan is at the forefront of many technological developments and this is still quite a new field. The show gives you a good idea of what is happening in Japanese Art Science departments and opens up a space for dialogue – biotechnology and media are here to stay – are we ready for them?","post_categories":["Events"],"post_tags":["science","tokyo guide art shows"],"date":"March 11, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Nasa’s Astronomy Picture of the Day: Sakurajima Valcano Unleashing Hell","content":"Today’s Astronomy Picture of the Day is this awe-inspiring photo of Sakurajima Valcano in southern Kyushu erupting.

Two trees – a Zelkova and Camphor – had stood on the site since the original home had been built, quite literally looking over the family as they aged and grew. “The daughter,” says architect Hironaka Ogawa , “has memories of climbing these trees when she was little.” Ogawa’s initial plans to somehow design the home around the trees was shattered when he saw how grounded these monumental trees were as being held securely in the palm of history. And yet he was being asked to make way a new abode that would continue to protect their growing family. The trees were cut down, but not before a Shinto priest was brought in to ward off any evil spirits. They were then transported to a local kiln where they were smoked and dried for 2 weeks to remove all moisture. The trees were then returned to the site where they were crane-lifted into the room and secured to act as main structural columns. “When this house is demolished and another new building constructed by a descendant of the client hundreds of years from now,” the architect says, “surely these two trees will be reused in some kind of form.”  source: submission","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["architecture-residential","garden"],"date":"March 1, 2013"},{"author":"Angela","title":"“Design Ah!” Exhibition Makes You Part of the Art","content":" The NHK education television series “Design Ah!” seeks to teach children about the wonder of design.

If asked 15 years ago Matzu probably would not have told you that he saw himself becoming an artist. At least that’s not what his trajectory would have suggested. Armed mainly with bilingual abilities he gained from several years living in the States as a child – Matzu enrolled in business school at Sophia University in Tokyo. Then just out curiosity, while still a senior he enrolled in a 2-year graphic design course, at which point he noticed that he liked using his hands to physically make things much more than he expected. “The school hadn’t brought in Macs yet,” he told us, “so luckily for me everything was done by hand. And I just fell in love with drawing.” Among his hidden talents, Matzu was a professional snowboarder. But when his time on the slopes came to an abrupt end after an accident forced him into early retirement, he transitioned into designing ads for snowboards. “It was the perfect job,” he said. “New designs are released just twice a year so I could focus on schoolwork and devote my summer to creating graphic designs and art directions.” Although his unique vision captured the hearts of many, he became more interested in creating something completely his own. “I was sumo wrestling in someone else’s ring. I needed to shift gears but the question was, how do I sumo wrestle in my own ring? The answer,” Matzu told us, “turned out to be art.”   There’s a lot going on in Matzu’s colorful, graphic work. Bi-polar elements like foreign/domestic, graphic/painterly, modern/traditional, edgy/academic swim through his paintings like the animals they’re inhabited by. But on the surface of those vibrant and energetic colors, one finds an unexpected familiarity, which, Matzu analyzes, is because “my work is heavy on the soy sauce.” Which perhaps explains the significant popularity of his works abroad. “Maybe it’s because Japan is an island but there’s a deep admiration for the foreign. Some Japanese might see my work and acknowledge it as a visual language that’s too close, too familiar.” Matzu will be participating in the upcoming exhibition “ Edo Pop ,” which opens this week at Japan Society. You can read our interview with Miwako Tezuka, gallery director at JS, in which she talks briefly about the new show.  It would appear that Matzu is at a disadvantage when it comes to cost structure. His paintings – because he uses thin, watered down paints and applies layers sometimes 20 times – take a ridiculously long time to produce. His complex, curved canvases have to be outsourced to a factory where it costs up to 10x as much as a regular square-shaped canvas. And for what it costs him to produce his sculptures he could buy a mid-range Mercedes. “It’s close to impossible, ” he told us, when we asked if he makes a profit on these pieces. “But, you have to make what you want to make. Hopefully it ends up being an investment in myself, but I can’t help but create what I love.” One of the strengths that Matzu attributes to his economics degree is not necessarily that he’s good with numbers, but that big numbers don’t scare him. Even if it costs $50,000 to put on an art show, he’ll press forward because he knows that if he sells $100,000 then he comes out even (because the gallery takes 50%). And while his background in economics certainly helps define him as an artist, we got the sense that one of his true strengths lies in his lack of any formal art training. It’s what sets him apart from others in a world where being different is all that matters. Matzu makes no attempt to hide the fact that he hires assistants to paint the works based on his very precise and articulate directions. He would create the original structure and creation “game plan,” but the works are highly labor intensive and requires as much help as possible to realize. While we talked, one of his studio assistants busily worked on small sections of a large painting that hung on the wall. “What do you look for in applicants,” we asked. “That they’re detail oriented and willing to put in their all for the sake of creating a perfect work – I do admit that tends to be Japanese,” Matzu said with a smile. “Oh, and it helps if your blood type is A.”  Having been influenced by artists like Basquiat and Keith Haring, getting the public involved in his art is something that’s always been very important to Matzu. But Matzu is very selective in the people he collaborates with. And he’ll only commit if he thinks his touch can create something special; a one-of-a-kind product. Case-in-point: above is a special edition series he did with Levis. His work is extend to the packaging, which he had printed, on front and back, a canvas, which further emphasizes the fact that the product inside is also an art work. And below are a pair of Nike sandals he created. He convinced Nike to put his artwork on the sole so that the art is the first thing to rub off and disappear, which is slightly ironic, yet ephemeral and very poetic. As usual, my son Huey had a few questions for Matzu: You can see our other studio visits right here .

The Pendulum Choir combines human vocals with computer-controlled hydraulic choreography. Swiss artists André and Michel Décosterd wanted to create a new mechanical being, and perhaps make you feel a bit uneasy about it. My initial reaction to a pendulum-swinging choir was a case of the giggles. It is amusing to see a group of grown men hanging from their toes. but the more I watched the performance the more I appreciated the beauty of it — the lack of collision, the vulnerability of the shakiness, and absurdity of the entire thing. It was lovely. As the pendulum shakes and torques the singers, however, the hydraulic harnesses begin to conjure images of a torture device and made me feel uncomfortable for laughing. The pendulums do not swing as smoothly as you might expect, and the singers struggle for it. According to the artists’ website , the mechanics operate in real-time, sending pre-programmed movements based on the progression of the music. The program is designed to eliminate the possibility of a crash, but that doesn’t alleviate the feeling that they just might anyway.

Late last year on a chilly November evening Otsuka Gofukuten , a retailer of Japanese traditional kimonos, opened to much acclaim and excitement. Within the beautiful walls of what used to be a tofu shop, guests stood around munching on sushi that had been stylized like kimonos by the chefs of A WOMB. There was an enthusiasm in the air that would, perhaps, have been unexpected at a traditional kimono shop opening. However, their kimonos are the only thing traditional about the new shop. It’s their method of dealing that sets Otsuka Gofukuten aside from the pack. Kimonos have conventionally been reserved for the wealthy, upper class. And therefore, pricing schemes have always been somewhat opaque – concealed for those who considered their pedestals to be too high for petty numbers. Otsuka Gofukuten set out to change and streamline a convoluted system which, they felt, was flawed. In their new system, all products are compartmentalized and clearly labeled according to a 3-step pricing system (10,000 yen, 30,000 yen and 50,000 yen). The interior design, which came together under the supervision of Yusuke Seki , helps showcase the 3 price ranges with original shelving. But it wasn’t just about moving into the future. Seki decided to preserve and use the original tiles from the tofu shop. “I wanted to explore diachronic aspects such as materials, stories, location, architecture and function to translate and add value through design,” says Seki. “All the aspects have a story and contribute to the overall store details. They take on a new life, having been a relic of the past – mirroring the theme of this new approach to Kimono design and wear.”   source: press release","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["kimono","storefront design","tradition","Yusuke Seki"],"date":"February 21, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Japanese Social Media Marketing: Pay Young Girls to Stick Temporary Advertising on Their Thighs","content":"The human billboard movement is nothing new. In 2009 the NYT reported on the phenomena, citing that tattoo-related advertising stunts go back to at least 2001, when an online gambling site paid a boxer to wear a temporary tattoo with its Web address during a televised bout. And more recently, Air New Zealand paid 30 people to become “cranial billboards” and wear campaign slogans on their shaved head. But a Japanese PR agency called Absolute Territory PR (絶対領域広告) has put their own spin on things (taking the movement “from weird to icky”), enlisting young girls to wear temporary tattoo ads on their thighs. The service is relatively new – it launched in July 2012 and boasted 1300 walking billboards by November. Becoming a member is relatively simple: as long as you’re a female over 18 with more than 20 connections on a SNS (twitter, mixi, instagram, etc.) you can join. To get paid you have to wear a temporary tattoo for 8 hours or more and post pictures of it to your SNS in at least 2 different places. Rates start at 1000 yen per day and can go as high as 10,000 yen, depending on how many pictures you take.   It’s difficult to judge how much traction the service is gaining. They’ve run some campaigns for pretty big names including one for Takashi Murakami’s new book, Green Day’s new album in Japan (I wonder if Green Day knows their album was advertised on young girls’ thighs…) the book store chain Village/ Vanguard, and others. But at the same time, about half of all their campaigns have been ads for their own service. But that’s understandable given they’re so new.  The big question is effectiveness – I think it’s easy to argue for young girls’ thighs, but do ads placed on young girls thighs actually get eyeballs? Or are people too shy to walk up to a girl and stare at her legs long enough to make out what’s written? A couple people have experimented with mixed results. Rocket News claimed that the service worked for them, Dee Okinawa gained 0 new twitter followers (but got a lot of Facebook likes and comments) while Sipro crunched some numbers and found the service to be worthless. The people behind Absolute Territory PR – a web consulting/production company called wit – have stated that the service is still in beta mode through the end of March 2013, at which point they’ll evaluate whether to keep it going or shut it down. Personally, I think that if you give it some time the service will catch on. After all, publicists will tell you that their job isn’t to personally get P.R. but, rather, to get other people to do it for them.","post_categories":["Interactive/ Technology"],"post_tags":["girls","Instagram","marketing"],"date":"February 25, 2013"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Chew on this: FabCafe lets you create a gummy replica of yourself for White Day","content":"After hosting their highly successful Valentine’s Day event in which ladies were invited to create a chocolate replica of their face, FabCafe has now released details of their follow-up event for the men.

The answers, based on 52 respondents were, understandably, varied. Most common were names like Frank Gehry’s Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (28 votes), Renzo Piano’s Menil Collection (10 votes) and Norman Foster’s Hong Kong Shanghai Bank (7 votes). But what we did was we put on our Japanese goggles and focused only on the Japanese architects that were named. The result is an up-close look at how Japanese architects are viewed around the world by their luminous contemporaries. Toyo Ito’s multi-purpose public structure (a library, art gallery, cinema, lecture theatre and cybercafé) received the most votes, including nods Zaha Hadid, Steven Holl and Stan Allen (Dean, Princeton University School of Architecture). Architects were presumably impressed by Ito’s forward-thinking ideas about how the building would become a “digital ecology” for users, as well as a series of technical advances that made the structure possible. This includes a support system of occupiable hollow tubes, as well as digital-ready media infrastructure. Japan’s celebrated master of minimal concrete clocks in at 2nd, even if you don’t count the vote he put in for himself! Located in a small residential suburb, the church is comprised of two modest buildings, arranged at an angle.

After graduation he moved to Gunnma prefecture where he met, and consequently studied under, Bruno Taut, a German architect who had fled to Japan to escape the Nazi regime. Throughout the 1930s Watanabe absorbed the many principles of the modernist movements like Bauhaus and, in particular, Le Corbusier. However, Watanabe was interested in purely importing western modernist ideals into Japan. Rather, concerned himself in how to weave them into a Japanese lifestyle. He succesfully managed to incorporate the concept of chairs into a predominantly floor-based lifestyle. The chairs he produced in the 1950s like the Himo Isu and Torii Isu became iconic images of Japanese modernism. Major works :      Watanabe was involved in the establishment of many of Japan’s groundbreaking organizations, from the Japan Design Committee to the Japan Industrial Design Association. He was also responsible for the interiors of many famous buildings including the Tokyo Hilton (currently Capital Tokyo), Keio Plaza Hotel and Prince Hotel.

Enter Hiroyuki Shinozaki , a young 34-year old architect who spent 7 years under the wings of the luminous Toyo Ito before establishing his own office in 2009.

Yet Tokumaru also deserves credit for keeping himself in the business of making music within these incredibly turbulent times. Besides moving a good number of albums, he provides tunes for NHK and Mujirushi Ryohin, tours Europe, and sells-out his shows across Japan.” Late last year fans in Japan got an early Christmas present when Tokumaru released In Focus, his first full-length album in over 2 years.

It was created by the Poland-based stop-motion masters Kijek / Adamski and features roughly 2000 “shapes” in a continuous stop-motion parade. “All these many ‘shapes’ are a representation of our memories – the good, the bad and the ugly,” says Tokumaru about the video. “In the same way that memories create incomplete pictures of the past, seemingly abstract, incongruous ‘shapes’ flow through the scene.” I’m also a huge fan of the cover art for his album.

It wasn’t Oscar Niemeyer’s Brazilian National Museum, nor was it Le Corbusier’s Unité d’Habitation. Not even Kisho Kurokawa’s Nakagin Capsule Tower. It was a home built on a budget of zero yen on the bed of Tokyo’s Sumida River. The owners at the time, 59-year old Suzuki-san and 52-year old Mi-chan, moved to Tokyo from Fukushima and built their palace with found materials. They live off money they got for recycling aluminum cans, and from spare electricity leftover from discarded car batteries. (Did you know that “dead” car batteries can power a small TV for 10 days at 5 hours of usage a day!?). “But I don’t call them ‘homeless,’” says Sakaguchi, of his revelation. “They have a house. I rent a house.” Sakaguchi began documenting the many Zero Yen Houses he found. He would interview inhabitants in order to gain a deeper understanding to their way of life. He grappled with the idea of land and property and the fallacy, he believed, of how we are told we have to own land before we can build a house on it. He struggled with notions of urbanity, and how cities clash with their natural surroundings, swallowing up the residents. This eventually led to a series of dream-like prints called “Dig-ital” that portrayed a dystopian cityscape of unbalanced buildings that expand out like a jungle. As fate would have it, Fukushima – where Suzuki-san was originally from – delivers to Sakaguchi another jolt, this time in a less amiable form. The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011 cripples the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Reactor, which begins spewing radiation into the atmosphere. Concerned about health-impacts on his 2-year old daughter, Sakaguchi relocates to Kumamoto, his hometown in Southern Japan. It is here that he comes across an abandoned 80-year old home and decides to build his very own Zero Yen House. On May 16, 2011 he opened “Zero Center,” a refugee camp for those affected by the nuclear fallout. Twitter became a powerful tool for Sakaguchi, who used the social networking service to spread the word about his new camp. The response was overwhelming. About 30 or 40 people brought their families and relocated to the Zero Center, which continues to function as a self-sustaining bohemian society. Sakaguchi eventually wants to transform Kuamoto into and “arts capital” – a place where people can live off of art.

We want to take a moment to thank you for stopping by and reading our posts. We know there are a lot of great blogs out there so it means a lot to us to when you decided to come to Spoon & Tamago. We’re excited about what 2013 holds: we’ll continue to improve functionality on the site, as well as hopefully relaunch our flash sales (which have been on hiatus). But most importantly we look forward to bringing you new and exciting stories on Japanese art, design and culture. Here are our 10 most popular stories of 2012, which – we’re proud to say – are all original stories that we reported on before any other foreign media outlet! A tiny fish that creates intricate sculptures to lure mates captured the hearts of our readers and was the most popular post of 2012. And now a major television network is looking to cast this little fish as the star of a documentary! A pop-up photobooth in Tokyo that prints miniature 3D sculptures of you and your close ones. Mini me, anyone? It’s open through January 14, 2013. Earlier this year the inaugural Tokyo Hotaru festival was held in which an impressive display of 100,000 LED lights – made to resemble fireflies – floated down the Sumida River through central Tokyo. When a Japanese farmer unearthed a peculiar-looking daikon radish, she gave it anthropomorphic traits and photographed it. A company in Japan has invented a mechanism that levitates homes moments before an earthquake strikes, making them immune to tectonic rumblings. Sounds like science fiction, right? Well it’s not. A new cafe in Shibuya merges craft and caffeine. Fab café comes with a laser cutter that anyone can use. However, it’s recommended you have your coffee before operating the machine. In celebrating the 50th anniversary of the iconic building blocks being introduced into Japan, 1.8 million LEGOs were used to create a gigantic replica of Japan. An installation of 11 computer-programmed incandescent light bulbs hung from strings. They playfully re-enact Newton’s Cradle – or more aptly, Edison’s Cradle – visualizing the transfer of kinetic energy. Mesmerizing. Haruki Murakami’s 1Q84 is epic in every sense. An art student at Cooper Union created an equally epic infographic that charts and visualizes all the meals that occur throughout 1Q84.

I cut Gerhard Richter too. I haven’t cut Cindy Sherman yet but I’m planning to one of these days. It’s going to take a bit more time to explore her volition towards the mannequin.” It’s a conversation that, while hinged with animosity, doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. Unless of course you’re talking to Noriko Ambe, a Long Island City-based artist who, among other things, creates intricate cut-outs from artist catalogs and other books. We recently caught up with her at her studio on a sunny, autumn morning. Ambe wasn’t always a sculptor. It was her interest in landscape and perspective that originally guided her through a degree in oil painting. But after struggling with a brush and paper Ambe became frustrated with what she felt was limited to the act of describing. She eventually stopped painting. It was around this time she rekindled her old fascination with maps and began tracing the lines. Everyone has an “Aha” moment. Ambe’s came in 1999 when she was on a small plane to Washington D.C. As turbulence took hold of the aircraft, Ambe stared out the window in fear. Hoping to calm her nerves, she focused on the sea of clouds and watched as the her own consciousness slowly melted into the topographies of the natural world. It was a sensation she had longed for. One that was missing from her work. One that was now a part of her artistic vocabulary. It was a study on the conceptual artist Luis Camnitzer that consequently led Ambe to establish herself in New York. In the summer of 1999 Ambe traveled to Italy on a grant from Japan’s Pola Art Foundation to participate in a residency program organized by Luis Camnitzer. The Uruguayan artist had moved to NY in 1964, where he co-founded the New York Graphic Workshop. After spending 2-months in Italy, Ambe followed in his footsteps and traveled to NY where she finished her 1-year residency and began her Linear-Actions Cutting /Drawing Project (the free-hand cutting of single sheets of paper and stacking them together), which would go on to define her career. But she continued to work out of Japan, periodically traveling to New York to meet with gallerists. In 2003, what Ambe calls a “shocking” development transformed her career. The Perogi Gallery in Brooklyn invited her to stage a solo exhibition. “You are crazy to invite an unknown artist like me for a solo exhibition,” Ambe told the gallery. “You have to be crazy, too,” they countered. The first book she ever carved into was one on the geography of Japan – a fitting title considering her practice was about to become a meditation on carving her own geography. Ambe quickly realized that, by recording her bodily actions, she was able to transcend descriptions and enter into something more infinite. What’s your definition of art, we asked. “When you transcend your own self-consciousness, then you have art,” she replied, without hesitation. Light-duty utility blades are the lifeblood of Ambe’s work. But to precisely cut layer at a time, not just any blade will do. After all, she replaces her blade after just a single layer of cutting. Ambe swears by a brand of blades manufactured only in Japan. Upon returning home, Ambe will visit 2 or 3 of the largest craft stores in Tokyo. And if you arrive after her, you’re out of luck as their inventory will have been depleted.  “Books have a message. I try to pull that message out,” Ambe tells us, as we gather around her collection of yet-to-be-cut material. But she admitted to us that there’s something inherently sadistic in her art. Once she is done cutting up a book – a process that usually takes 2 – 3 days – its original purpose has been lost (transformed is probably a better word). “Part of it is guilt,” she says, “but the other part is a ‘just go ahead and do it’ feeling.” But it’s that feeling of guilt that pushes her to create an art object that she’s satisfied with. Something that will make up for the fact that she has just destroyed a book. “Joubutsu,” she says, referring to a Buddhist term that refers to someone who has died and entered Nirvana. In fact, listening to her talk I couldn’t help but be reminded of the classic image of a Samurai warrior saying a prayer for a victim he had just slayed. As Picasso once said, “every act of creation is first an act of destruction.” We got a sneak peek at Ambe’s latest work. Below is “A Piece of Flat Globe” volume 29 and 30.

Time to look back on Japan’s best products of 2012, according to (PDF) ad agency Dentsu. Take it with a grain of salt but I always find it fun to remember what the collective psyche of Japan was thinking about these last 12 months. Curious about what was big last year or the year before? Check out the previous lists . I’m beginning to sound like a broken record because, for the 3rd year in a row, smartphones are number 1 on the list. The Japanese just really love their technology. Earlier in the year ComScore reported that “Smartphones surpassed feature phones as the most acquired device type” in Japan. Google’s Android accounts for about 65%, followed by Apple with about 32%. Ok, I’m putting myself to sleep. Let’s move on. The highly anticipated opening of Tokyo Sky Tree in May of this year helped push the world’s tallest free standing tower up 1 notch on the list. It’s being reported that “visitors have to wait several hours on weekends and more than an hour on weekdays to buy a same-day entrance ticket. Attendance has been much stronger than anticipated, prompting the operator to make upward revisions to their forecasts, which now call for 6.4 million visitors by its one-year anniversary. Zuckerburg and his social network catapulted up to 3rd after being buried in the high-twenties last year. Ever since launching their presence in Japan in 2008 the website has struggled to gain users in the face of Japanese web culture, which has historically discouraged sharing personal information online. But two incidents appear to have shifted the way Facebook is perceived in Japan, and the Japanese now seem to be overcoming their online shyness. Understandably, the Social Network and Jesse Eisenberg’s award-winning portrayal of Zuckerberg helped make Facebook more approachable. Unexpectedly, last year’s Tohoku earthquake and tsunami helped shift attitudes as the site played an important role in helping spread important information and connecting lost ones. A survey done earlier this year “put Facebook in the No. 1 position in Japan for the first time, ahead of Twitter and onetime leader Mixi.”  But perhaps the most telling indicator of how times have changed is this student survey that showed that 2 years ago the most-used SNS was mixi, at 97%. This year? 2%. Benefiting, in part, from number 1, high-tech robot cleaners that can be controlled from your smartphone climbed up on the list. Well-designed models in a variety of colors, coupled with a drastic price reduction, has made them more accessible than ever in the household. Replacing edible rayu as the year’s most sought-after condiment was salted rice malt. Although the traditional condiment, made from fermented malted rice, salt and water, has been used in Japan for decades, only recently did it come into the spotlight as a trendy way to stay fit and look good. It got picked up by several media outlets as part of an enzyme diet, which has been steadily gaining popularity. It then got boosts from various celebrities who wrote about how they use it to cook. The list includes Takako Uehara , Yuko Ogura , Jun Komori , Aya Ishiguro , … moving on… Sugi-chan is a popular comedian whose tough-guy parodies brought him to fame in 2012 and landed his catchphrase, “ ” (wild, isn’t it), at the top of Japan’s top buzzwords for 2012 . Japan takes their mascots seriously. TV networks have mascots, milk has a mascot, blood has a mascot. There’s even a school where people go to study how to become mascots. But if you were a mascot in 2012 you only wished you were a local municipality mascot – those guys were killing it! Above is Kumamon, the mascot for Kumamoto prefecture and arguably one of the most popular local mascots. It was designed by iconic art director Mizuno Manabu . To borrow the words of The Bruce Dickinson, these girls put their mini-skirts on just like the rest of us – one leg at a time. Except once their mini-skirts are on they make gold records! Indeed, a look at the top 10 singles of 2012 confirms that AKB48 (and their spinoffs) dominate spots 1 -4, as well as 7, 8 and 9. Sigh…. Let’s move on. Japan historically performs better in the summer Olympics, rather than the winter Olympics. So it’s understandable that the country was glued to the games, which ran from July 27 – August 12. Although Japan slipped to 11th in medal count (from 5th in 2004 and 8th in 2008), the country was nonetheless proud of its athletes. Japan is “finally discovering the joy of flying cheap, with the arrival this year of three low-cost carriers.” Pictured above is Peach Aviation, Japan’s first low-cost carrier, which was followed by AirAsia Japan and Jetstar. We’ll see if the trend sticks and, if indeed, the airlines convince a notoriously workaholic country to take a vacation.","post_categories":["Industrial Design"],"post_tags":["hit products"],"date":"December 11, 2012"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Yusuke Oono’s 360 degree Christmas book","content":"Back in October , Yusuke Oono won a contest by designing a palm-sized book that opens up 360 degrees, creating an entirely 3-dimensional storytelling world.

It’s not everyday that a pre-eminent symbol of our new world is encased in a pent-house apartment with grand views of central park. And it’s not everyday we are allowed to enter that apartment to ponder the 120-year old sculpture by Italian sculptor Gaetano Russo and enjoy an intimacy reserved only for pigeons. Our contributing editor Masako caught up with Tatzu Nishi earlier this week in New York to talk to him ahead of the closing of his exhibition, which was extended until December 2. Here, we bring you, in English and Japanese, his reflections on public art and its role in contemporary society.  アートの一つの大事な役目は、見慣れた日常の物の別の側面／視点を見せることなんだ。そのことによって，日常の物が突如として違った見え方をあらわしてくる。そうやってアート作品は、人々の想像力を刺激し続け、拡張していくっていうわけなんだ。アート作品は人々に自由でいることを教えているのかも知れない。 別の側面／視点を見せる作品は，必然的に日常とは異質なものになっていく。ニューヨークが現代アートの中心であるというのは、もしかしたらその「異質さ」を受け入れる土壌があるからなのかもしれない。人種や生活習慣や宗教が違う人々が一つの場所に生活しているわけだからね。そう考えると，なぜ日本で現代アートが受け入れられないかもわかってくるな。 １５年前にパブリックアートでアーティスト活動を始めたんだけど，アートシーンの内輪だけのゲームに嫌気がさしたからなんだ。９５％以上の普段は現代アートに興味がない人々を無視して、狭い世界で活動しているのがね。だから作品を作るときは，その９５％の人が作品に興味を持つように仕掛けも考える。今回の Discovering Columbus の仕掛けは、建造されてから１２０年たつコロンブス像に始めて近づくことが出来るということなんだ。これだけを目当てに部屋に入る人も多いと思うけど，部屋に入った瞬間その異質な空間に気づかないわけにはいかない。そこがアートへの入り口というわけ。日常からはなれ，常識が壊れ，想像力が活発になり，何かから解放され自由な気分を味わうことが出来るんだ。 (English follows below….) An important role of art is to take ordinary objects, or point of views, and turn them upside down on their heads. By doing so, things are suddenly not what they first appeared to be. So that’s how art continues to stimulate and broaden our imagination. Perhaps that’s how art teaches us to be free. Because art reveals another aspect, or perspective, it inevitably becomes something “different” from the norm. The reason NY is able to remain the epicenter of contemporary art is because they have a culture of accepting these differences. It’s a melting pot of different races, customs and religions, all coexisting together. Which then begins to explain why contemporary art isn’t fully accepted in Japan. When I started creating public art 15 years ago, it was because I was tired of the art scene being a game played only by people in the know. It was made for the art world insiders, and ignored the 95% or so who have no interest in contemporary art. That’s why I try to make art that triggers the interest of that 95%. For Discovering Columbus, the trigger is the fact that this is your only chance to see a statue up-close – something no one’s been able to do since it was built 120 years ago.

Some of these grand homes have been converted into museums, some remain residences and, for the most part, the neighborhood has been left unchanged. But in constructing a new home in the neighborhood, architect Takuya Tsuchida of no.555 ( previously ) made a point to not blend in. “I believe that building design should both respect and challenge the potential of an area and the direct environment,” he said. Dubbed “planter” for its use of balcony gardens that make the structure look like one large plant pot, NDA was completed in May of this year. The 3 story home stands tall with a regal self-assurance. Punctured holes dot the concrete walls and function as balconies up high and a garage down low. Takuya Tsuchida has a knack for creating homes that not only look beautiful, but (and arguably more importantly) have the potential to transform lifestyles. His attention to detail embeds his homes with, for lack of a better word, devices.

It’s on display at Kyoto’s Shigamo Shrine through December 16.

The hills, which would rise between 10 and 15 meters, would be constructed from last year’s tsunami debris and would serve primarily as an evacuation site that would delay the entry of tsunamis. The structure of the mounds, the company states, would absorb the force of the tsunami, rather than push against it the way conventional seawalls are designed to do. The mounds would come in 3 sizes – small, medium, and large. A small mound will accommodate 50 evacuees, would cost 100 million yen (about $1.3 million) and could be built in about 6 months. On the higher end, a large mound will accommodate 1,300 evacuees, would cost 500 million yen (about $6.3 million) and would take 18 months to build.  Below are some of the specs that the company lists: It’s hard to take this company serious given their history of large-scale imaginative yet wholly impractical proposals.

In case you haven’t heard of him, you should check out his current project . I had never heard him speak so I was delighted, yet not all that surprised, to learn how brutally honest and funny the man is. We were treated to numerous insider stories and behind-the-scenes incidents, giving us an enlightened view into what it actually takes to install his large-scale public art projects. I wish I could share them all but that would result in an incredibly long post so here is 1 episode that, for reasons uncertain even to myself, really stuck with me. In 2006, Nishi created an installation for the Aichi Prefectural Museum of Art titled “sometimes extraordinary, sometimes less than common.” The piece incorporated the museum’s most expensive artwork – a Picasso from his blue period valued around $40 million – and encased it in a typical middle class Japanese kitchen. The original concept was to demonstrate that, when an extraordinary work of art with historical significance is placed in common setting it maintains its aura. But to Nishi’s surprise, when the room was complete and staff replaced the color copy with the original painting, it was wiped clean of any aura. In fact, when visitors entered the room many of them didn’t even notice the Picasso. Instead, they were impressed by the replica of the kitchen. At the last minute, Nishi decided to change the name of the piece to something more fitting, hence the current title. And convincing the museum staff to was no easy feat either. Their most prized possession was suddenly going to be placed next to a rice cooker, a bottle of soy sauce, and a carton of cheap sake – all items that have the potential to easily ruin a painting. Nishi finally convinced them by promising to mount every single item to its surface. This way no one would be able to lift the kettle, or any other item for that matter, and swing it at the painting in some drunken stupor. However, no one on the team had calculated how long it would take to mount everything and, low and behold, they ran out of time. But instead of making a big deal over it, they just said nothing, crossed their fingers, and hoped that the exhibition would run smoothly without incident. Luckily for them, it did. The ordeal underlines one of the main takeaways of the talk – how difficult it is to implement public art in Japan. Based on Nishi’s own experience, Japan is by far the most difficult country to get public art projects approved. England tails behind at 2nd, but with a huge margin. And yet “Japan needs public art the most,” Nishi argued. But they’re just not interested in doing anything different, anything beyond their call of duty.

Now Japan’s largest maker of toiletries is back with their antics. They’ve devised a toilet soccer goalie that can block shots hurled by some of the greatest soccer players in the world. How exactly does it do this? Two high-speed cameras placed on the goal posts capture, analyze and predict the final destination of the ball in under 0.1 seconds. It then adjusts its position and a powerful spring thrusts a ball out of the toilet bowl, making contact with, and deflecting, the original soccer ball. The toilet can apparently process and react to balls shot at as fast as 160 km/hr (about 100 mph). Seriously. Watch the video: Why exactly does it do this? Well, I’m not entirely sure. It’s partly to promote their athletic grants. It also demonstrate the technology and research that goes into developing their toilets. But beyond that… The toilet, dubbed S.G.T.K (Super Great Toilet Keeper), is not invincible. In 2007 the Guardian compiled an unofficial list of thunderous shots. Coming in first was Sheffield Wednesday striker David Hirst, with a shot recorded at 114 mph. David Beckham came in second place with 97.9 mph. S.G.T.K was developed with the help of Creative Director & Engineer Hiroki Nakamura, who also worked on TOTO’s toilet bike. S.G.T.K will travel around to various soccer stadiums in Japan before being unleashed into the wild. For 600K yen (about $7,500) S.G.T.K will come to your soccer field where players will be able to take the challenge. No, you cannot use it as a portable restroom.

They get lots of exercise, eat healthy and, in turn, benefit from one of the highest life expectancies in the world. But the mentality extends beyond lifestyle and gastronomy, even to architecture, where designers come up with creative solutions that enable residents to exercise and keep in shape – both physically and mentally – in the comfort of their own home. Here are 5 Japanese homes that help you keep in shape. The sport of rock climbing is one of the best all-over exercises you can do for your body as well as your mind. But it’s not the most accessible as most people don’t have boulders in their back yards and rock climbing gyms can be expensive. But imagine if you had a rock wall in your own home! This unassuming 2-story house in Tokyo by naf features a climbing wall that scales a central courtyard and extends all the way to the roof. Originally built in East Hampton, NY and later replicated in Mitaka, a suburb of Tokyo, the Reversible Destiny Lofts are, according to the architects, supposed to oppose death. It’s undulating concrete floors force residents to use their bodies in unexpected ways to maintain equilibrium which, in turn, “will stimulate their immune systems.” An elevated residence in Kanagawa designed by Takuya Tsuchida . A central alleyway is lined with natural grass and functions as a mini golf course so you can work on your swing by simply stepping out of your door. However, long shots are frowned upon by neighbors. Recent studies have shown that one’s sense of balance begins to degrade in your 20s and that it’s downhill – literally and figuratively – from there. But maintaining that delicate sense of equilibrium is critical to your health and this house in Tokyo by Hiroyuki Shinozaki Architects can help. The 4-story house features huge rectangular holes in the walls and floors, forcing residents to maintain a keen consciousness of their bodies and their surroundings. And I emphasize “forcing” as not doing so can, consequently, be hazardous to their health. Walking up stairs is one of the best-kept secrets in preventive medicine. In fact, if you’ve ever been to a cardiologist you may have been told that you’re fit enough to have sex if you can walk up 2 or 3 flights of stairs comfortably. But sometimes walking up and down indoor steps just doesn’t cut it. That’s where Toshihiro Yamada’s house comes in. It features steps that start just above ground level and climbs all the way over the roof.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["architecture-residential","bouldering"],"date":"October 16, 2012"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"A MUJI x Spoon & Tamago Winter Contest","content":"In anticipation of the cold weather soon to come, we’re having a fun little contest over on our Facebook page .

Having grown up Toyo Ito’s  “ House in Kamiwada ” (1976), he had a home-grown appreciation for organic, ethereal structures and a distrust of simplistic formulas, making Hirata, an ex-protege to Ito, a natural choice.

Lead architect Osamu Nishida, along with partner Naoko Mangyoku, erected – in what could easily be written off as a slightly larger-than-normal crack between 2 houses – another actual house. The plot of land measured just 9-tsubo (about 300 sq ft) and could be best described as, well, a gap. But in that gap, and in their typical non-conventional style, the team succeeded in erecting a house that, while narrow, somehow manages to meet all the criteria of a comfortable living space. It was completed last month but if you’re curious as to the process leading up to completion, and how exactly they squeezed this tiny house in, check out their blog .

Its tropical location supports a lush rainforest, swamps and a population just over 2000. Despite not having an airport, the largest of the Yaeyama Islands receives an astounding 300K tourists per year, thanks to an airport on a neighboring island just a 40-minute ferry ride away. Enthralled by the magical island which, in itself, is a national park, it’s not rare for these tourists to start a new life for themselves on the island that, theoretically, is just a little over 4 hours from Tokyo. That’s exactly what happened 14 years ago when this couple decided to move to the island. But it wasn’t until just recently that the two decided to break ground, building what will be their permanent home. Completed earlier this year, “villa921” marks the very first project by the very young architectural firm Harunatsu Archi , led by architect Shoko Murakaji. The structure itself is primarily concrete but with large windows that open up onto a luxurious patio. A canopy extends out, shading the patio from harsh rays of sunlight that can be up to 5x as strong compared to the mainland. The house requires very little in that it’s more complicated urban siblings simply try to compensate for a lack of the great outdoors – things like privacy, sunlight, and openness are all already part of the package. However, Iriomote-jima has something else that Tokyo doesn’t: tropical storms. These winds come frequently, often knocking out power (no air conditioner) and lasting for several days (no open windows). To combat this issue the architects installed fasteners around the house which can hold a protective screen in place, allowing the inhabitants to open their windows without letting the water in.

At the same time, he went out and bought a brand new NIKONOS, a 35mm film camera specifically designed for underwater photography. He devoted all his spare time – aside from his day job – to perfecting his art of underwater photography. Then, at age 39, he finally made the transition. He quit his office job and became a freelance underwater photographer. But even for a man who spent the last 50 years immersed in the underwater world of sea life, the ocean proved infinitely mysterious. While diving in the semi-tropical region of Amami Oshima , roughly 80 ft below sea level, Ookata spotted something he had never seen. And as it turned out, no one else had seen it before either. On the seabed a geometric, circular structure measuring roughly 6.5 ft in diameter had been precisely carved from sand. It consisted of multiple ridges, symmetrically jutting out from the center, and appeared to be the work of an underwater artist, carefully working with tools. For its resemblance to crop circles, Ookata dubbed his new finding a “mystery circle,” and enlisted some colleagues at NHK to help him investigate. In a television episode that aired last week titled “ The Discovery of a Century: Deep Sea Mystery Circle ,” the television crew revealed their findings and the unknown artist was unmasked. Underwater cameras showed that the artist was a small puffer fish who, using only his flapping fin, tirelessly worked day and night to carve the circular ridges. The unlikely artist – best known in Japan as a delicacy, albeit a potentially poisonous one – even takes small shells, cracks them, and lines the inner grooves of his sculpture as if decorating his piece. Further observation revealed that this “mysterious circle” was not just there to make the ocean floor look pretty. Attracted by the grooves and ridges, female puffer fish would find their way along the dark seabed to the male puffer fish where they would mate and lay eggs in the center of the circle. In fact, the scientists observed that the more ridges the circle contained, the more likely it was that the female would mate with the male. The little sea shells weren’t just in vain either. The observers believe that they serve as vital nutrients to the eggs as they hatch, and to the newborns. What was fascinating was that the fish’s sculpture played another role. Through experiments back at their lab, the scientists showed that the grooves and ridges of the sculpture helped neutralize currents, protecting the eggs from being tossed around and potentially exposing them to predators. It was a true story of love, craftsmanship and the desire to pass on descendants. [Aug 26, 2013] Video footage of the little artist at work recently surfaced. It was uploaded to YouTube by MarineStation Amami, a hotel and dive center that assisted Yoji Okata and NHK in producing the video segment that aired last year. Of note, watch at around 1:20 when the fish takes a small shell in his mouth and plants it in the sculpture. Scientists believe that the shells are filled with vital nutrients and this is the soon-to-be-father’s way of preparing nourishment for the babies.

His favorites, probably because of their wide appeal, are Umaibo (a Cheetos-like corn snack shaped like a stick), Potechi (potato chips) and baby star (crispy noodle snack). Perhaps his most extreme undertaking is 107 Buddhist figurines carved from Umaibo – just short of the sacred number 108, according to Buddhism. Originally an illustrator, Kawachi moved around various studios drawing illustrations for Wired Japan , as well as creating flyers for Takashi Murakami at the ad agency TSTJ . But when his grandfather passed away, Kawachi attended, for the first time, the funeral of a family member. The event had a profound effect on him, sparking an interest in Buddhism and religion. He came across a story about how a Japanese Buddhist monk named Enku would always present families who had befriended him with Buddhist statues he hand-carved into sticks. The sticks quickly became play-toys for the kids – abused and misused. But Kawachi saw an interesting lesson in the story and, from that day on, began carving Buddhist statues into Umaibo (literally, “delicious stick”). Kawachi has also worked with other snacks in his “Embalming” series. Below is a broken potato chip he repaired using kintsugi, a traditionally Japanese method of using gold seams to repair broken ceramics. Below, Kawachi empties a bag of Baby Star noodle snacks and adheres them onto a canvas. Want to learn more about the artist?

We ascended the elevator to the top floor of her building where we were greeted by Oreo, a boisterous English Cocker Spaniel who voiced her excitement at our arrival. Tall and slender, Tamura showed us into her apartment – a space that tells the story of Tamura, both past and present. For Tamura, becoming a designer was in her DNA. Having grown up in a family of designers, for her, it was the most natural process. In the 1940s Tamura’s grandmother founded Familia , a line of children’s clothing. Her father was an industrial designer and her mother, an interior designer. Tamura’s first memories of making something with her hands, she tells us, was at Christmas time. Family tradition stated that each member must make hand-made gifts for each other. So at an early age, Tamura was already steeped in the process of envisioning what other people want or need, and then creating it. The family even held mock design critiques. “Having my work praised highly was really rewarding,” reflects Tamura. “If I retrace my steps, that was probably the beginning.” When Tamura moved into her blank slate of an apartment 3 years ago she did what any seasoned designer would – she remodeled her own apartment. Taking advantage of the double-height ceilings, she added a floor to half of her space and hand-made a spiral staircase that leads up to it. Expecting to use her space to also present work to clients, Tamura made a long, black table from charred wood. And yet, while the hand of the designer is clearly evident, only scant traces of the designer’s name are to be seen in the space. Aside from a stack of prototypes of her recent silicone leaf plates , we struggled to locate any of her actual designs. “I don’t like showcasing things I made, in my house,” she told us. As it turns out, this is a direct result of Tamura’s design philosophy, or lack thereof. Tamura never liked the idea of a designer being in the front and preferred that the work stand on its own. Although, admittedly, she told us that she has become more flexible in recent years, as long as it helps to promote the work. Tamura does very little to cultivate her own celebrity. She doesn’t have a twitter account or a Facebook page. In fact, trying to get to know her on the Internet is virtually impossible – believe me, I tried. When we posed several typical designer questions (what designers do you admire, what is your design philosophy) Tamura struggled for answers. Her attitude was one of naïveté, coupled with a humility that at once disarmed any impulse of resentment. Tamura didn’t even want to appear in this studio visit. She refused to have her picture taken, unless she was hiding behind her work, which I thought was interesting in that it mirrored her real-life design philosophy. Finally, we got her to pose with her dog, Oreo. After much coaxing, she finally puled out from her cupboard, some Pyrex measuring cups that she had designed. The Pyrex redesign came right after Tamura had finished working on a design project for a cellphone – an object that epitomizes discardable gadgets that just aren’t made to last. In Japan, cellphones are often given away for free in exchange for a contract, and Tamura couldn’t help but feel a certain emptiness in designing, what she felt, was a temporary, non-lasting work. On the other side of the spectrum was the iconic Pyrex measuring cup – a kitchen staple that I recall my mom cooking with. The task? “Make it so your grandchildren can still use it.” “I loved the challenge,” Tamura reflected. Redesigning an object that, for a large part, had not changed shape since its existence was exciting and refreshing. In the end, she proposed a cup with a wider mouth, so it can be used as a mixing bowl. She also incorporated bold, red graphics that can be read from above. (In the past, one had to bend down to make a precise measurement.) When asked if she cooks much herself she told us, “Yes, I do moderately.” Jokingly, she added, “I don’t think they were interested in hiring a European male designer who never cooks.” Next, we got Tamura to reveal her Alight miniature LED lights inspired by the fireflies she saw, growing up in Japan. Fireflies are often used as a (unofficial) barometer for pollution – or lack thereof – in Japan where a common saying is that fireflies only come out near clean rivers. Consuming just 11W of energy and lasting for 20,000 hours, Alight is a reminder of our wasteful habits when it comes to energy consumption. For the cellphone design project she did in NY for the global arm of a major Japanese company, Tamura conducted intense human behavioral observations, recording hundreds of people and the different ways they use their cell phones. The result was a 70-slide PowerPoint presentation she used to justify her design. “The process for industrial design and something like furniture design, it’s like two different worlds,” she explained. “the ‘wow factor’ and usability are both very important, but it’s as if they get factored in at 2 different points in the process. Both are stimulating, but in different ways.” For someone who lives and breathes design, it’s hard to imagine Tamura doing anything else. “If you weren’t a designer, what would you be doing right now,” we asked. “I’d probably be a complete slob,” Tamura laughed. “Like, just a really bad human being.” As usual, my son Huey (5) had some questions for Tamura, which she happily answered: Check out our other studio visits, all conveniently archived right here .

Among other things, she entertained Fia-chan, my very hyper-active daughter)","post_categories":["Industrial Design","studio visit"],"post_tags":["Nao Tamura","studio visit"],"date":"September 4, 2012"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Happy pre-100th Birthday Doraemon","content":"Yesterday was September 3, 2012, which marked the 100-year countdown to September 3, 2112, the day when Doraemon, the amazing cat robot, is to be born. A product of Fujiko Fujio’s imagination, Doraemon and his magical fourth-dimensional pocket, which produces fantastical gadgets from the future, have tickled the minds of children (including myself) since the 1970s to today. It was easily my favorite cartoon growing up in Tokyo. However, we didn’t have a television so I vividly remember my mom taking me to a local soba shop near our small apartment in Koenji. We would sit down and order our dinner. A couple of minutes before 7pm, my mom would stand up, walk over to the waitress, and kindly ask – in broken Japanese – if we could change the channel. Looking back, it must have been an odd sight: an American mother and her small child, quietly slurping their noodles while watching cartoons. Doraemon, I love that you continue to work your magic with my kids, the same way you did for me. Here are some Doraemon pre-birthday events that were happening around the world. In Hong Kong , a month-long exhibition is being held (through 9/16) with all sorts of exciting memorabilia, including 100 Doraemon sculptures and a life-size gadgets. In Kawasaki (the setting for the popular show) Doraemon is named honorary citizen. The City of Kawasaki’s website experienced a surge in traffic, and even temporarily crashed, as people tried to have a look at Doraemon’s official certificate of residence (PDF). In Toyama (where Fujiko Fujio was born) a Doraemon train was unveiled. And last but certainly not least, Google commemorates Doraemon’s birthday with a special tribute video showing how many of Doraemon’s futuristic gadgets have gone on to inspire real-life innovations.

When fate led her to an old building that had been abandoned over 10 years ago, she knew this was it. With the help of friends, she spent 6 months cleaning up the place, but preserved the eye-catching exterior.

In fact, I use “deconstruction” in the most literal sense. Last winter when I traveled back with my family to spend Christmas and New Year’s in Tokyo, I lugged a copy of 1Q84 back with me. I had recently finished reading it and thought my Dad would enjoy it. After all, he was the one who started all this when he reached into his bookshelf and removed a dusty softcover of The Wild Sheep Chase, handing it to me with the warning, “this is one weird book.” He accepted my gift graciously, seeming slightly daunted by its sheer mass. We returned to New York and and, after several weeks, I inquired. “Did you read it?” “Not yet,” he told me. Several additional attempts resulted in the same answer until, finally, I stopped asking. My Dad liked to read on the train. The book simply must have been too heavy to accompany him on his daily commute to and from his University. Last month they visited us in New York and, at one point, my Dad sat me down. “I finished the book,” he said, with a gleam in his eye. I knew which book he was talking about. He went on to confirm my thoughts that it was indeed too heavy to carry around. “I tried reading it in bed too. But when I put it on my lap – I kid you not – it would cut off my blood circulation.” This seemed a bit far-fetched but I stayed on course: “So what did you do?” My dad opened his mouth but then paused. He turned and looked at my Mom, who was sitting next to him. She nodded. “You can tell him.” As it turned out, my dad had taken an Exacto knife and, one-at-a-time, carefully sliced and removed 100 pages. This little mini-chapter of stapled pages slipped comfortably into his black shoulder bag. And when he finished it, he took the book out, sliced another 100 pages, stapled them together, and placed it into his bag. He repeated this process until he had finished the 944-page 1Q84. I was fascinated by this seemingly sacrilegious act and asked my Dad to send me pictures of the decimated paperback as soon as he got back to Tokyo, which he did. Seeing the pictures I was at once both struck and reminded of the impermanence of books. I was no longer looking at a sacred object that had been desecrated, but at an object that had merely shifted form to adapt to its user’s needs.

During Japan’s self-imposed isolation, between 1603 – 1868, Dejima functioned as a lone outpost – an “anomaly” where foreign ships were allowed to dock and conduct trade. In an interview, autor David Mitchell describes the island: Dejima served as a place where goods, people and ideas mingled. It had all the ingredients for stories to be born. And one of those stories is about the doctor and botanist Philipp von Siebold who, in 1822, was sent from the Netherlands to Japan to gather information on the mysterious country. While based on Dejima he befriended a Japanese painter named Keiga Kawahara, often commissioning him to paint different wildlife species he had found. The collection grew to 6000 – 7000 pieces, and became the basis for books like “Flora Japonica” and “Fauna Japonica.” To this day, his precise drawings are used as samples by biologists. In a new exhibition, Lost at Sea, on display through September 12, 2012, jewelry artist Nina Sajet creates a series of intriguing jewelry pieces inspired by Keiga Kawahara’s prints. “Fish have had a role in culture through the ages, serving as religious symbols and as the subjects of art, books and movies,” says Sajet. “For me the capturing of the poetic element of the Fish and especially its beautiful shapes lead to new designs.” Her jewelry collection is on display – juxtaposed alongside Kawahara’s prints – at K-Studio in Nishiazabu, Tokyo.

However, if placed in an actual tank, rather than a plastic coffin, watching the little fishies bob up and down is admittedly soothing, and is a great way to take your mind off the sweltering heat.

For the ones familiar with it, there was no doubt; Yoyoi Kusuma had arrived. This pop-up installation celebrates the collaboration between the iconic Japanese artist and French luxury brand Louis Vuitton. This fusion is obviously a success in Japan for two reasons. First, Japanese girls are fond of Louis Vuitton products. In Tokyo they are everywhere – even the beach! Second, there is a strong sense of pride amongst Japanese girls that Yoyoi hails from their home country. Furthermore, right now Kusama may very well be the most popular Japanese artist worldwide. For all these reasons, the collaboration is a major event in Japan and is echoing across various industries and geographies.

The locusts are fetching up new breath for one, final onslaught, humidity is on its last leg and back-to-school commercials are invading the airwaves. But you can still enjoy the great outdoors while simultaneously visiting the largest art gallery in the world. Running until September 17, the Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennale is just about half-way through. But that still leaves you 3 weeks to immerse yourself in one of the largest art festivals in the world, in one of the most unlikely places in the world. Known for their heavy snowfall in winter, the Echigo-Tsumari region is located in mountainous Niigata – easily accessible from Tokyo in a little over an hour by train. Once there, you’ll traverse 200 villages across roughly 190,000 acres, all dotted with site-specific artworks created by some 220 artists from all over the world. The organizers admit, it’s an “absolutely inefficient approach deliberately at odds with the rationalization and efficiency of modern society.” The intention is to interact with the beauty and richness of the land, which serves as a canvas for art. Below are some of our favorite picks – a small cross-section of what you will see if you make the pilgrimage. Unless otherwise noted, all images are courtesy Echigo-Tsumari Art Field. (Note: some works were created for previous triennials and remain standing) Architect Ryo Yamada installed a foundation of colored wooden decks that interact with its surrounding nature. During summer, flowers and weeds grow through the boards while, in autumn, they transform into a canvas for fallen leaves. Artist and “ The Group 1965 ” member Tsuyoshi Ozawa created a series of architectural sculptures inspired by Kamaboko Storehouses – an indigenous warehouse with a curved roof, designed to withstand heavy snowfall. The functional warehouses come with a fish-eye window so visitors can see what’s stored inside. Cameroon-born, Belgium-based artist Pascale Marthine Tayou created an installation of oversized pencils, hung at varying heights. Each is inscribed with the name of every country in the world. While awe-inspiring in its multiplicity, standing under it one is reminded of the menacing and destructive potential that each holds. Upside down pencils not your thing? Jun Honma created an installation of 7000 right-side up pencils, all collected from locals, in a kamaboko warehouse (remember those?). The forest of pencils works to merge with the real forest surrounding it. The 12-member collective F-Nokai has transformed an old tea house into a large ikebana flower arrangement. Before his death, the art critic and triennale advisor Yusuke Nakahara donated his collection of 30,000 books. As a form of commemoration, the prominent artist and sculptor Tadashi Kawamata created an giant house-like installation using his books. An added bonus: free wifi available inside through the end of the festival. Walking down a small, grassy dirt road you will come across a house, covered in thousands of small mirrors. Depending on your perspective, the house, at times, appears to melt into its surroundings. Harumi Yukutake , known for her large-scale installations in which she covers public structures with mirrors, hand-made every mirror, which gives me a new-found respect for her art. Stepping into the house is like stepping into another dimension – one where conflicting elements like truth and deception, light and shadow, still and moving, all peacefully coexist. Nothing is more out of place than this Golden Teahouse, in which Ryo Toyofuku covered the disheveled interior with gold paint. It’s hard to believe that Lee Jae-Hyo’s geometrically soothing spheres are made only from found wood. The sculptures will eventually be consumed by the vegetation surrounding it.

What you’ll also find are architectural luxuries epitomized by the very rare 1-story house. House M marks the 4th residential project of 34-year old Hiroyuki Shinozaki , who returned to his hometown to design this 1-story house for 2 women. Completed in early 2012, the home consists of six trapezoid-like structures that flare out of a central living space, defining rooms like the bathroom, kitchen and bedroom. Shinozaki utilizes the spaces between the trapezoids to create windows and, in the exterior, to create a deck and parking space. And as if putting a final touch on a toy home, a large roof made from wooden joists rests upon the house like a lid. I love how the space feels so connected and consistent. After a 7-year stint working under Toyo Ito , Shinozaki established his own office in 2009 and has been based in Tokyo since then.

Yanagi first immersed himself in Japanese history and WWII at Yale University, where he received his MFA in sculpture in 1990. A year later he created “Banzai Corner,” a fascinating piece that “mirrors” the Japanese flag using ultramen figurines. Yanagi creates an illusion of the iconic “hinomaru,” or circle of the sun, by arranging roughly 350 ultramen figurines in a quarter-circle against two mirrors in a corner. Aptly titled “Banzai Corner,” the superheroes can be seen raising both arms in the air, demonstrating the gesture used when shouting “Banzai,” a traditional Japanese celebratory exclamation meaning “ten thousand years.” But it’s also worth noting that “banzai” or “banzai charge” was a term used by the allied forces during the war, referring to the Japanese military tactic of mounting suicide attacks. Speaking to the NYT back in 1995 about Japan’s emperor system, Yanagi said, “All these people died for the emperor because they thought he was a god, and it turned out that he was just a small man with a human voice.” Despite the sheer presence if the piece, in all its multiplicity and glory, I sense a strong emptiness that is only compounded by its repetition. It’s quite amazing that his use of ultraman – a superhero who rose to fame in the 1960s and remains highly popular amongst kids even today – has helped the piece sustain its relevance over the past 20 years. It’s currently on display at the Benesse House Museum on Naoshima. It’s worth noting that, in the same year, Yanagi was experimenting with the Japanese flag. In particular, I’m reminded of his Hi-no-maru drawings (below) he did for Storefront for Art and Architecture in NYC, applying many similar geometric rules and concepts.

It’s appearance continues to evolve as ants travel through the maze of flags, mixing sand as they go. The symbolism, as crystalized in “Pacific” (below), which pokes fun at the notion of national identity and how even the island of Japan is not immune to the mixing of cultures and identities. “My works,” says Yanagi “are borders I have had to cross or barriers I have confronted in trying to define myself as a Japanese.” Yanagi has always been interested in ants – often describing them as the perfect allegory for self.

It refers not only to book covers – which do get a fair amount of attention – but also to the way pages, text and images are laid out, serving as a conduit for reader experience. I’ve been keeping a running log of great, somewhat out-of-the-ordinary, book designs that I’ve come across. Here is a selection of great book designs, and I’ll devote a separate, single post to one of my favorites. What is essentially one massive company brochure, Taiyo , a small printing company, came up with the idea for a book dedicated to those who continue to believe in real books. Loosely translated as “disappearing paper, lasting paper,” the book was designed by Doppo and has been used for all sorts of purposes from marketing to employee education.

In an exclusive Spoon & Tamago interview, we talk with her about her hopes and ambitions for JS, as well as the the art field in Japan and NY. What emerges is an energetic figure who is not afraid of the challenge the new appointment brings her.   One thing I really want to do at JS is to unpack Japan. JS has been around for over a century now and their mission has always been to create a platform for people outside Japan to understand Japan, and I think that introductory period has been done. Even when I was working at Asia Society (AS), I realized that a lot of people think they know Japan and Japanese culture through the cultural stereotype. The time is right for us to forge forward, to bring in more multicultural aspects of Japan; things people would see and say “I didn’t know that existed in Japan”. I want to bring surprises to people. I think that’s very important. I would like to take the institution to the next step by creating more dynamic programs that feature aspects of Japan that people might not know. There are many hard-to-get-to areas in Japanese art so I want to bring those out. I would love to organize exhibitions that talks about the multicultural aspects of Japan. Japan’s relationship with other parts of Asia, and all over the world. Another approach I want to experiment with is to look at Japan and find other cultures within Japan. The first exhibition I will be overseeing is next spring 2013 – a show called “Edo Pop: The Graphic Impact of Japanese Prints,” originally organized by the Minneapolis Institute of Art . The curator, Matthew Welch, organized the show by selecting Edo prints and incorporated works by contemporary artists who drew inspiration from the graphic sensibilities of ukiyo-e, merging a dialogue between traditional art and contemporary art. For JS, we will add Japanese artists based in NY as well as artists from different cultures. Showing artists who are not Japanese in JS means we are going to see more diversified views of Japan – introducing Japan as something we don’t know. NY is a melting pot so that just makes sense. I think it is a good approach for the gallery to carefully select traditional objects and have contemporary artists commune with them and create new works, to engage the audience who is more knowledgeable about traditional art. When you consider the development of Japanese art, it’s not such a new idea because there’s always this echoing effect. For instance, we’re opening a Sakai Hoitsu show this fall and Rimpa is all about looking back at courtly culture of Heian. The Edo artists who were so interested in that culture, studied classical literature and poetry and tried to bring subjects from that period to their works. They were the avant garde of that time. It’s the same tradition of finding inspiration and creating connections transgressing time, which is the concept of tradition. I also want to look back at the history of JS. I believe there are various approaches we can explore, for instance I think it would be interesting if we researched the past 30 years or so of exhibitions and select highlights, inviting scholars to see how interpretations have changed. This will tell the story of the evolution of JS, as well as the Japanese art field. That will make people feel familiar with JS and also make us notice what we did and also what we still need to do – kind of a self-analysis. Exposing yourself to criticism is the only way to move forward. For that purpose, I plan to be a troublemaker. But in the end, I believe in the love and dedication, as well as the generosity, that our patrons have for JS and Japanese culture that will allow us to do innovative exhibitions. The JS building is the youngest landmark in New York City, and the city’s first permanent example of Japanese architecture, built in the early 1970s by Junzo Yoshimura . It’s a beautiful architectural creation that echoes simple Japanese aesthetics. I want to use that building almost as a forest or a tea garden, where the minute you step in you discover something. It can be ambitious but since we have a very strong performance art and film section, I want to collaborate with them to create something that engages all senses. Engaging not only visual artists but also architects, designers, and performance art as well. We want to poke Japan from the outside to instigate something; make something happen within Japan as well as outside. I want to bring artists who have never shown out of Japan before. I want to pull them out of that cage and wake them up and give them the opportunity. They need an obachan like me to bang on their door and be like “come out and eat dinner with us!!” If we can give just 2 weeks of the outside world to the artists who have never been abroad, even that can change their perspective and the way they make art. Not everybody is depressed there. There are artists who are dying to come out but just don’t know how – artists who just needs a nudge in the right direction. Japanese artists who are already here, they are the strong ones I think. They already made a statement by being here and continue to work. For the Edo Pop exhibition, I want to show artists who are here and also artists in Japan to analyze the difference, put them into conversations and let them figure it out. When at Asia Society (AS) I worked on “all of Asia” and most projects focused on one particular culture at a time. At AS I was looking at Japan within Asia, but at JS I will be looking at other Asian elements within Japan or looking at other places from Japan, and it gives me great pleasure to work specifically on Japan and finding new aspects in it. JS needs to find its niche and make a strong statement. Because of the financial difficulty these days, a lot of institutions are trying safe programs, but a small institution with no collection like JS can become a kind of Kunsthalle. I learned that through Dr. Melissa Chiu, who basically mentored me and taught me how to line up exhibition programs that provide an institutional presence in the globalizing world. She was always thinking about what makes AS special compared to other institutions: how to see it in that larger context. I come from an art history background. I specialized in 1950’s Japanese avant-garde art and wrote my dissertation on Jikken Kobo (“Experimental Workshop”) who were active in the 1950’s in Tokyo. I chose that theme because I was always interested in collaboration. Jikken Kobo did that with visual artists, theater people, photographers, noh actors, modern dancers etc. This group was a very young creative force at the time, and they inspired me so much that I want JS to become a Jikken Kobo. I want JS to be a modern day experimental workshop where creators can get together and generate something new. Collaboration can occur in physical space with other institutions or it can be virtual. We can post a video of a contemporary artist conducting a gallery walk through traditional art exhibitions, showing the perspective of a creator instead of just a curator or director. I have been in NY for 23 years, but there was no “Contemporary Asian Art” scene back then. A handful of dedicated scholars like Drs. Reiko Tomii and Alexandra Munroe started to build the field and open this door to a new world, and I was encouraged by their trailblazing work. Now, Japanese contemporary art is in a unique place. Japan has produced the first contemporary artists with international fame. People like Yayoi Kusama, Hiroshi Sugimoto and Takashi Murakami etc.: they are already here. And especially this year and next year more Japanese artists have the chance to make themselves known to the world through major museum exhibitions planned. Kusama has her retrospective at the Whitney, a Gutai show will open in Guggenheim and MoMA will showcase art from “Tokyo 1955-1970” etc. So it’s a good time for contemporary Japanese artists to come in. This kind of flow is very important because it creates a movement, the audience gets familiar with one movement after another and the knowledge base starts to build up. The NY contemporary art world needs to shift towards more experimental projects. Instead of showing established artists, they need to open up their mind and create a new approach and perhaps broaden the market base. I felt this way because I just went to Documenta and also to galleries in Berlin, where the types of works they show are different from those in NY. The works are more conceptual, they require the audience to be engaged more intellectually. The galleries will not expect you to understand, but they will show it anyways and ask the viewer to interpret it the way they can. NY galleries recently have been showing works that are easier to understand, easy for your eyes. So art has become easy entertainment and a commodity rather than an intellectual challenge. The NY art scene needs to be more conceptually challenging. I had them done because of my upcoming trip to London, where Ei Arakawa invited me to take part in his performance art at the opening series for The Tanks at Tate Modern with Nishizawa Harumi from the Kamakura Modern Art Museum. All we know is that it starts with a lecture on Jikken Kobo but then moves on, requiring us to react spontaneously to Arakawa’s world.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["interview","Japan Society"],"date":"July 25, 2012"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"The Miniature Books of Miyako Akai","content":"As is often the case in blogging, venturing into one rabbit hole leads to a cavernous cave of multiple rabbit holes, where you can easily get lost for hours on end.

Often constructed in sizes no larger than the tip of a finger, Akai’s mame-hon or “bean books” – as they are called in Japan – made her a star amongst the miniature book community. In 2006, she was awarded a distinguished prize from the Miniature Book Society (yes, there is an organization for everything).

Fast forward 17 years and to Osaka where Suga Atelier have designed a home that has its owner surrounded in wood. Discouraged by how the role of timber has been relegated to the realm of structural supports and finishes, the architects decided to flip the material inside-out. They created a system of wooden frames that created an open and warm space. But a little too open, some might say. The new owners should probably invest in some good-looking blinds because even passersby will feel they’re surrounded in wood.

That was the question artist Eiji Sumi was trying to ask when he installed “Densen/Plus a” at Koi Art Gallery in Bangkok last month. The installation featured a mix of still life paintings, drawings, sculpture and photography that created an electrifying space within the gallery. And indeed, in Japan and other countries there have recently been calls to bury underground the electrical lines that cloud skylines and disrupt otherwise clear views. In Japan especially – a nation prone to earthquakes and falling cable lines, one wonders why the task hasn’t been completed already. As it turns out, the “No Wire Movement” has slowly been progressing throughout Japan. But not only does the infrastructure project come with a hefty price tag, but some argue that it’s actually better to keep them within reach, instead of burying them in hard-to-reach places. When the Great Hanshin Earthquake struck Japan in 1995, power was restored relatively quickly because most electric poles remained standing and it was easy to patch the wires back together. But if the wires had been buried under rubble it could have taken much longer to dig them out and then repair them, potentially stifling the recovery. Visitors will undoubtedly be turned off by the ubiquitous cables that are almost impossible to hide from. But for those who have spent many years in Japan, this may not be the case. For me personally, electric power wires have become so engrained in my psyche that I find them rather nostalgic, if not downright comforting. What do you think?

There, amongst a comprehensive documentation of the architect’s work since 1986, rests the mobile tea house “Walking Café.” Fujimori’s latest structure remains strongly affixed to his fascination with the tea house, but with a European twist, hence the name. And in an interview with DETAIL Magazine he talks about the unlikely inspiration for the piece. It’s a place with strong personalities, says Fujimori, speaking about the state of Bavaria. The use of shinglings and copper armor was very much an homage to the traditional local architecture. Fujimori, with the help of local craftsmen, students and children, sourced only local materials. But he also had some help from a famous painting, housed in the local Alte Pinakothek museum, a historic gallery known for its collection of Old Master paintings. “The Land of Cockaigne,” painted by Pieter Bruegel the Elder in 1567 depicts a mythical land of excess, but in a very unflattering way. In the painting, men are passed out after a feast while a half-eaten egg, a chicken and a roasted pig run about. Fujimori’s tea house is somewhat of a dichotomy – a structure meant to encourage moderation and, in some cases, even asceticism, being constructed in the symbol of gluttony and sloth. However, it’s important to remember that in the case of the Trojan horse, it’s not what was on the outside but what was on the inside that mattered most. If you’re interested, check out our article on Japanese designers and tea houses , which of course features the work of Fujimori.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["tea","tea house","Terunobu Fujimori"],"date":"June 27, 2012"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Kofunaki House by ALTS Design Office","content":"Bringing the outdoors, in is something Japanese architects excel at. Numerous theories – land constraint-mandated lack of gardens, historic revere for nature, etc. – collectively explain the phenomenon. But a recent trend in architecture has taken the concept of subtly blending barriers and thrown it out the window. Instead, architects are ditching potted nurseries and, instead, planting gardens right in the heart of living spaces. We first noticed the trend last year with this house that incorporates a rock garden into the living area. And several others followed, which tells us that home-owners are warming up to the new definition of indoor gardens. And the latest home to emerge is certainly a beauty. “Kofunaki House” was completed in March and is the latest residential project by Shiga-based ALTS Design Office . The Studio, which is headed up by Yoshitaka Kuga and Sumiou Mizumoto, are known for their relaxing, open spaces that emphasize nature as a means to a richer lifestyle. And Kofunaki House is no exception. Nestled within an eco village nearby lake Biwa, the home, with its nature-filled interior, is a kickback to traditional Japanese homes (minka) that often incorporated a dirt floor (doma).

We’re excited to be able to work with LINK in showcasing the debut of their new line of Furoshiki (traditional Japanese wrapping cloth). And in addition, we’re also happy to share an exclusive interview and photos of the furoshiki printing process, which was done at Chiffonez , a printing company in Japan. Despite having a large portion of their operations in Kanagawa, their sewing factory is in Fukushima, where they sustained heavy damage due to the earthquake and tsunami. 10% of all furoshiki sales will be going towards recovery efforts in Tohoku. I really love the modern twist that in-house designer Lucinda and UK-based designer Hannah Waldron applied to the age-old furoshiki. Kyoko , Link’s Tokyo director, and photographer Martin Holtkamp visited the furoshiki printing facility, along with Mr. Tanaka of Chiffonez. The facility is located near Chogo Station on the Odakyu-Enoshima line. The owner of the furoshiki printing facility, Mr. Fukuda, is carrying on a family tradition that has spanned over 50 years and two generations. Fukuda, who emits the faintest odor of salt, has enjoyed a long career. He started dyeing furoshiki all the way back when he was in kindergarten. A: There are many stages in the furoshiki production process. Factories are divided up into various specialized fields, and Chiffonez plays the role of coordinator all the way through to the final stage. First, at the factory that produces the templates, they are stencil dyed one at a time by hand. Colors are added one by one in the process, so if there are a lot of colors, the number of templates increases. The work is done by hand, but the artisans are highly skilled, so they duplicate the desired design data within millimeters. After that, they are sent to the printing facility to begin the dyeing process. After the desired design data is confirmed, the colors are mixed based on the Pantone system, using data that we’ve accumulated over time. Coloration is deeply affected by climate and humidity, so all of our work is done with careful consideration given to the weather forecast. Everything his hand-dyed, so the most we can color in one day is 3000. If there are a lot of different colors, we can’t do more then 500. (The facility we visited performs this stage of the dying process.) The furoshiki dyeing method is one in which long cloths are stretched tightly by a special machine, and then colors are applied meticulously so as to not deviate from the pattern. This craft that doesn’t allow for even a millimeter of deviation–having that sense of distance between neighboring points–is truly a super-human feat. To the observer, the technique, in which the cloth is placed in a frame, and the color is applied quickly and rhythmically, seems to be over in the blink of an eye. That is a testament to the physical strength and experience of the workers. After one color is applied, the application of the second color is where the meticulous nature of the craft becomes apparent. LINK’s furoshiki don’t have these one millimeter shifts in hues right next to each other, but of course such furoshiki certainly do exist. Once the dyeing process is finished, the cloths are briefly dried, washed in water to settle the colors, and because they shrink slightly, they are shipped to a sewing factory. In the tsunami of March 11, 2011, the sewing factory in Fukushima Prefecture that did the sewing work on LINK’s furoshiki was destroyed. The area around Fukushima and Miyazaki has always been a place where there were a lot of factories making Japanese clothing, but the terrible damage from the tsunami has made it very difficult to getting things up and running again, even now. Since then, the sewing for LINK’s furoshiki has been handled at a factory in Tokyo. A: Actually, there are automatic printing methods, but one machine can run as much as 40 or 50 million yen, so not a lot of manufacturers in Japan had them. The lot count for our orders is low, but that is compatible with our methods of stretching and dyeing. Our workers have worked alongside one another for many years, are familiar with all the stages of the process, and are far more accurate than any machine. A : If you use cheap fabric, it will shrink a lot, so we have to be careful when we select fabric. The material we used in making the recent line of LINK furoshiki is a light material called shantung. A : We have a lot of boilers for keeping the dyes dry. It gets really hot in the summer. This factory has been operating since the Showa 30’s (1957~66), so it has suffered a lot of wear and tear, but it’s practical and we’re used to it, and not a lot of manufacturers use this kind of equipment, so we’ll probably be working in these conditions for a long time. Fortunately, when the big earthquake hit, the place where we store our templates swayed in the same direction that it was leaning, so we didn’t take a lot of damage. A : On Hannah’s design, since it was a design that used two colors, and was a playful pattern that was intentionally just slightly irregular, we had to be very careful to match up the two pattern templates. For Lucinda’s design, in order for the origami pattern to come out beautifully, the degree of effort that we put into applying the color became extremely important. We then posed this question to Mr. Tanaka, from the furoshiki maker, Chiffonez. A: Popularity of the old brands has declined, and instead, traditional Japanese designs are pretty popular right now. Even more than furoshiki, we are getting a lot of orders for handkerchiefs. It is believed that printed handkerchiefs also originated in Japan. Even still, every year there are less and less factories, as production is being moved overseas. You can see a huge difference in quality, though, in the intricacies of this craft that has been cultivated over so many years, in this craftsmanship that Japanese people happened to possess from the very beginning. With skepticism toward mass production, and a sense of the unique qualities of Japanese craftsmanship, recently, inquiries about dye orders from places like Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and America are on the rise. However, in all honesty, there is always a fear that the number of craftsmen will go down, demand will go down, and then what will we do? I really hope that by sending this interview out to people all over the world, we can show them some of the fine craftsmanship and history of Japan. Be diligent every day. Be creative and innovative. Our future is in your hands. These are one of a kind, handmade objects. And though this craft may be at the mercy of things like climate and humidity, it has a long, deep history. In these objects one can truly feel the value of the delicacy and care that give them their superior quality. And one feels that one way or another this amazing craft will be passed on to future generations. In the production of every single furoshiki is a story. A story of design, modeling, coloring, and sewing, and of so many different hands working together. In the process of completing this grand collaboration, we can certainly feel a renewed sense of pride in the delicacy of making things by hand, and in LINK furoshiki. LINK is donating 10% of our Etsy sales to the sewing factory that was damaged by the tsunami. All furoshiki are available through LINK’s etsy page .

Based in Brooklyn, Ando had just returned from Puerto Rico where she had created an ethereal installation of bioluminescent leaves. Raised in Okayama and Santa Cruz, Ando is a descendant of samurai-era Bizen sword makers-turned-buddhist priests. She carries on her family’s heritage by primarily working with steel and incorporating a zen-like minimal aesthetic. Greeting us as we entered was a large deer head and antlers that hung on a wall between 2 windows. The piece appeared to have been cast from resin but we later learned that Ando had covered the wooden head in graphite, a material she had been experimenting with recently. And as if being flanked by the deity-like sculpture was an assortment of tools and a cluster of inspirational objects that spanned quotes, diagrams, a 100-ft scroll, a drill press and a family altar. The adjacent walls were lined with Ando’s signature hand-dyed aluminum panels. The reflective qualities of the metal, combined with its monumental weight, is one of the things that has Ando forever intrigued. And indeed, walking alongside, one can’t help but feel mesmerized by the ever-changing shades and gradations. At times, you feel the urge to take one, even two steps backwards because you’re suddenly struck with the fear that you’ve missed something beautiful. Because it didn’t exist previously, Ando coined a word to describe her process. Taking her cue from the ancient Japanese indigo-dying process (藍染め), she calls her aluminum dying process (アル染め). Ando’s pieces are currently part of a group show at Sundaram Tagore gallery in Chelsea (through July 21, 2012). If you’re on the west coast, the pieces will be shown in a solo show “Meditations” at Madison Gallery (from July 16 – August 4, 2012) Above, Ando’s armor-like (long-sleeve) kimono hangs in her studio. The piece was hand-soldered using over 4000 sterling silver rings and stainless steel plates. Ando says she was inspired by a kimono that her grandmother made for her, which led to the creation of this unusual life-size replica. On the left is Ando’s wall of tools. On the right, she tells us, is her “wall of narcissism.” Ando shows us a piece of steel from the World Trade Center twin towers, which she sanded down until it displayed a clear reflection. Last year Ando was commissioned to create a sculpture – fashioned out of contorted remnants of the fallen towers – to commemorate the attack on the World Trade Center towers. Above is one of Ando’s latest pieces in which she hand-carved a Buddhist scripture into a slab of metal. While vastly contrastive compared to Ando’s massive iron and steel sculptures, the artist has also created an ethereal silk scarf: Tetsu to kinu scarf (鉄と絹スカーフ), literally “iron and silk” scarf. It’s currently available in the Spoon & Tamago shop . Although Ando tells us her use of blues comes from her deep love and reverence for the sea, she is also endlessly inspired by wood, namely redwood, and the ways it can work with or against metal. As usual, my son Huey (5) had some questions for Ando.","post_categories":["Art","studio visit"],"post_tags":["Miya Ando","studio visit"],"date":"July 3, 2012"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Tokusatsu Pop-Up Museum at Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo","content":"Tokusatsu – it’s a word that invokes big dreams and nostalgic adventures – especially if you grew up watching shows like Ultraman and Kamen Rider.

It’s a tale of architecture, appropriation and a real estate market that thought it could. The year was 2005. The World’s Fair was being held in Nagoya, Prime Minister Koizumi was pushing his postal privatization bill through the Diet and the Japanese stock market was doing just fine. Renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma had just put the finishing touches on The Scape – an ultra-upscale residence in a swanky neighborhood in Shibuya. But fast forward to 2012 and it doesn’t take an economist to figure out that much has changed. For obvious reasons, demand for over-the-top private homes had tanked, prompting the management company to adopt a strategy to deal with a new economic climate. They closed down their residences and decided to renovate them into coworking studio spaces for a new generation of freelancers and other professionals who were in need of flexible office space. They rebranded themselves as The Scape (R) – R standing for “reborn” – and opened up for business in March of this year. A young team of architects and designers were brought in to reshape Kengo Kuma’s original vision, while still maintaining the creativity and inspirational forms that the structure had imbibed. The furniture and overall space was designed by Naruse-Inokuma Architects , who most recently, helped create a laser cutter café in Shibuya and a café for tsunami refugees in Tohoku. Landscape Product s and CIBONE were also brought on to assist with some of the furniture, while the signage and illustrations were done by Kimiaki Eto and Noritake . The Landscaping is the work of FUGA . To round out the team, Think Green Produce was in charge of creative direction. The result is a fascinating space that conveys youth and vitality while evoking memories of the hegemony of wealth that once prevailed. In an oddly morbid sort of way, the building manages to generate an awareness of the theatrical nature of magastructures within an urban environment. You can gain access to The Scape (R) 24 hours a day and rates start as low as 7000 yen per month for morning and night access. But be prepared to shell out 20,000 yen for membership, a monthly utility bill of 4,500 yen and a refundable deposit of 7,000 yen.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["co-working","Naruse Inokuma Architects","tokyo guide","tokyo guide play"],"date":"June 20, 2012"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Four Seasons of the Heart","content":"-Teruaki Samejima, “Four Seasons of the Heart” ","post_categories":["notes from the editors"],"post_tags":["quotes","seasons"],"date":"June 20, 2012"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Pots made from radioactive soil collected from within the Fukushima exclusion zone","content":"Young and daring student designer Hilda Hellström unveiled an atomic project for her MFA senior thesis show at Royal College of Art (RCA). She got in touch with Naoto Matsumura, the last man still living within the 12-mile exclusion zone in Fukushima – a place where 78,000 people once lived. In March the Japanese government eased restrictions last March but much of the area remains off limits due to high levels of radiation. Hellström travelled to Japan and met Matsumura, who was eager to assist in her project. Using slightly radioactive soil that she harvested from Matsumura’s farmland, Hellström constructed these rugged “food vessels” – a complex, provocative name that explores the usefulness, or lack thereof, of contaminated land. What’s fascinating about this project is the powerful narrative embedded with these seemingly day-to-day objects. Their ontext immediately transforms them into artifacts of history. Much in the same way that a piece of the Berlin wall can signify so much and so little at the same time, depending on the audience, Hellström’s radioactive vessels have the potential to inhabit a narrative that goes far beyond its form or function. It’s an excellent example of how an artwork, depending on how we frame it, can vastly increase or decrease our artistic experience.

But when the tsunami came, Kudo evacuated his home for high ground, leaving his stencils on a desk. The waves enveloped his home. In fact, they rose to the entrance of the temple, which sits atop a high hill. “I was sure the stencil had been lost,” Kudo says. “But when I returned to my home 2 days later I was surprised to find the stencil right where I left it. It wasn’t even wet. The desk must have floated gently to the ceiling.” The stencil’s survival was an important reminder of the significance of a craft being passed down from generation to generation.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["gucci","Handmade","religion","Shinto"],"date":"June 7, 2012"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Carving Out Your Own Space in Central Tokyo","content":"| click images to enlarge After years of commuting from his parent’s home in Chiba to Tokyo for work – a round-trip excursion that ate into 4 hours of his entire day, Murashima knew it was time for a change. He decided to build a small home in Tokyo. Just minutes from Yotsuya-Sanchome station he purchased a discounted 15-tsubo (533 sq ft) plot of land – miniature even by Japanese standards. And to make matters tighter, a building-to-land ration of 60% left him with just 9-tsubo (320 sq ft) of land to play with. But it’s size wasn’t the only reason for the attractive price tag. The land was situated on top of a 15ft-high stone wall – part of which had to be carefully removed before work could even legally begin. And the 3 tall houses that surrounded the plot of land looked to jeopardize Murashima’s hopes for a sunlight-drenched kitchen. Murashima went to Miurashin Architects to see how far his 30 million yen ($380K)  budget could take him. The architect, who has a knack for taking adverse land conditions and turning them on their head, came up with an impressive plan to satisfy all the demands of his client. Specifically, the plan involved a total of 9 stackable steel units placed on top of each other. Instead of doors or walls (so 2011) the multilevel spaces defined each room, creating smooth transitions throughout the house. With a little creative thinking the architect was able to overcome some very dire obstacles. The house, known as 43base, was completed late last year and Murashima, along with his parents, his sister and his sister’s husband, were all able to move in.

A meet-up with the monks – a monthly event hosted by Ginza Modern Art gallery – has been gaining traction amongst young men and women in their 20s and 30s. And in March, “ The Field Guide to Beautiful Monks ” was published and became an overnight sensation. From “comforting” to “creamy,” the colorful picture book, which profiles 40 of Japan’s most hunky monks, sold over 10,000 copies in in its first 2 months on the market. Now the story moves offshore to the island of Shikoku where devoted worshipers, or simply individuals up for a challenge, travel to take part in a 670-mile pilgrimage visiting all 88 temples ( Gmap ). If you decide to participate in what’s known as the Shikoku Hachijūhakkasho Meguri , at Eifukuji Temple you will come across the swanky new home of the chief monk who reside at the 57th sacred location. And this isn’t just any old bare-minimum-roof-over-your-head house. Seventy-seven windows are cut into the thick walls and serve to frame views of the surrounding nature. Some windows are meant to muffle any disturbances from tourists and visitors while others provide a lens to capture a summer sunset. Completed late last year, it was designed by Tokyo-based architect Zai Shirakawa who, 2-months earlier, completed a temple office at the same location. Whether designer priest homes or easy-on-the-eye monks help pave the way to enlightenment is hard to say. But what we do know is that there has been a clear increase in enthusiasm towards Buddhism in Japan. Whether it was the mechanics of economic deprivation, the impact of the earthquake and tsunami or Buddhist monks opting for slightly out-of-the-ordinary tactics, it will be interesting to see how this trend develops.

Nao Matsumoto demonstrating how he created the mold for his middle finger candles Nao Matsumoto loves guns and is preparing for the next zombie outbreak. Some of Matsumoto’s most prized possessions are his collection of wood-carving tools, which were all hand-crafted by artisans in Japan. Although Matsumoto grew up in Japan, he attended an international school and speaks English and Japanese fluently.  He walks a grey line between American and Japanese culture, often using his unique perspective to his advantage in his artwork. He spoke to us about his fascination with bosozoku, or Japanese motor cycle gangs, and how their culture, stylized fashion and way of life represent a unique Japanese invention. And the fact that female motorcycle gangs coexist in a largely male-dominated society represents an enigmatic paradox. Furthermore, the incorporation of bosozoku – and other various offshoots and subgenres – into western culture would suggest that they have indeed transcended the conventional boundaries of motorcycle gangs.

During the day the phosphorescence collected and absorbed energy from sunlight, giving them a soft, blue glow at night. Using indigenous Ficus leaves to create small boats, the ephemeral 24-hour installation pays homage to the history of boat travel and refugees in the country. But it also mimics Puerto Rico’s natural phenomenon of bioluminescent bays , which are full of single-celled bioluminescent dinoflagellates: half-plant, half-animal organisms that emit a flash of light when agitated. Titled “Obon,” the project was inspired by the Japanese festival of the same name – a ceremony to honor and commemorate the departed. Ancestral spirits are believed to return home during this festival. And on the last day, lanterns are floated on rivers to guide the spirits back to the netherworld. I wish I could have seen this in person but Ando told us that the impermanence, coupled with the very clear leaves, made the project feel delicate and wondrous, like when you see a firefly. “The leaves sat in the pond all day and were very unassuming and clear but all the while they were absorbing light. Then visitors arrived and in the darkness I was amazed because there were so many people at the unveiling yet it was totally quiet as people stood and sat at the edge of the pond and just watched these little leaves glowing and floating and moving slowly around.” Sounds magical!

In case you didn’t hear, in mid-May Takeshi received a lot of attention for a project he was installing for NY Design Week. But it wasn’t the kind of attention he wanted. We chatted with Takeshi about his time in jail, Milton Glaser, some new works as well as his current feelings about NY.  Having greeted us in his common uniform – a white t-shirt and cargo pants – Takeshi told us how touched he was by the overwhelming unity and show of support he received from friends, colleagues, fans and even strangers. A facebook page that was set up following his arrest quickly ballooned to over 3500 members. Reflecting on the experience, Takeshi told us he felt very bad over the commotion and delays that resulted in a bomb squad descending over Williamsburg. Takeshi spent 5 nights in jail, which is a great miscarriage of justice in our opinion, before this whole miscommunication was sorted out. But “it was an interesting experience,” he told us, in a calm manner you wouldn’t expect from someone who shared a cell with drug dealers and suspected murderers. “But I wouldn’t want to do it again,” he added. In jail Takeshi became quite the celebrity. “You don’t belong in here,” other convicts would say, encouraging him and cheering him on. “You’ll be out of here in no time.” Some even asked him to autograph newspaper articles covering his story. But it wasn’t all fun and games. Fights would break out between inmates, while others were passed out in a pool of their own urine. Takeshi had to sleep in a cramped cell that was freezing cold. It was the most non-ergonomic furniture you could imagine, he told us, demonstrating the only possible sleeping position . “I would love to redesign prison cell furniture,” Takeshi told us. Takeshi’s collection of miniatures. Before starting a new project, Takeshi always creates a miniature model of the piece. As Takeshi was being escorted away by the police, he instructed his friends not to phone Louis Lim before 9am. Takeshi knew that his sleep-deprived assistant had been burning the midnight oil working on his own project, and didn’t want to wake him. After being takent to the precinct in Greenpoint, Takeshi used his one telephone call to contact, not a lawyer, but the office of Rafael Vinoly , as he was working on a project for them. But at 7AM, the only person around to answer the phone was a security guard. Takeshi proceeded to calmly dispense instructions for a project that was supposed to occur later that day. After jotting everything down, the guard – presumably confused and slightly bewildered – asked if Takeshi needed any help. “No, don’t worry about me. I’ll be fine,” he replied. Anecdotally, Takeshi enlightend us on the intricacies of prison currency. The telephone call renders the quarter far more valuable than it ever would be in the outside world. The average exchange rate for a single quarter amongst inmates? Three dollars. above: “14+1” is one of Takeshi’s earlier storage designs in which various boxes slide out to reveal additional storage.

Takeshi’s idea for his “I ❤ NY” lanterns were driven, quite literally, by his love for NY – a city that had supported him mentally and artistically for the last 23 years. But his love letter was also an homage to the iconic NY-based graphic designer Milton Glaser (designer of the I ❤ NY logo) – a figure, Takeshi told us, who inspired him at a very young age to become an artist. Unfortunately, his letter was sent to the wrong address, misread and misinterpreted. “Do you still heart NY?” His obvious answer to a question we didn’t really need to ask – “Absolutely.” Takeshi will, without a doubt, continue to enlighten the minds and hearts of New Yorkers through his creativity. But although released from prison, Takeshi’s case is still ongoing – he must return to court on June 21.

Japanese celebrities like Namie Amuro and Mika Nakashima, who frequently appear on camera flaunting their ink, have helped the art form – once reserved only for ranks of the yakuza – get its foot in the door of the fashion world. But a recent incident in Osaka has reignited the debate over what is acceptable body art in the conservative country of Japan (and how much of that is the business of the government).  It was a surprising move by Toru Hashimoto – the young mayor of Osaka who has gained popular support for defying the central government in his opposition to restart nuclear power plants. In response to a seemingly isolated incident in which a childcare worker displayed a tattoo to scare the children, the municipal government launched an all-out investigation. The study was conducted by a mandatory survey asking employees whether they had tattoos and, if they did, to indicate where on their body. A total of 110 employees (0.8% of all 34,000) reported that they had tattoos, with 98 of those reporting that they were in visible locations. Here is the breakdown by department: At a press conference Hashimoto was visibly upset: At a press conference yesterday the mayor stated, “if Lady Gaga or Johnny Depp came to me and asked for a job with the Osaka government, I would turn them down. [Their tattoos] are only acceptable because they are celebrities. I will not tolerate tattoos on public service workers.” Hashimoto later added that it was highly unlikely that said celebrity would apply for public service work.  Let’s step back for a moment to figure out how we got here. – figurines dating back to 5,000 BC were uncovered and the engravings on their face are thought to represent tattoo marks. – the first written record of Japanese tattooing was discovered in a Chinese text, which stated that Japanese “men young and old, all tattoo their faces and decorate their bodies with designs.” References were typically in a negative context. – the first written account of tattooing as punishment in Japan. The rebel Hamako, Muraji of Azumi ( 安曇連浜子) was brought before the emperor but the merciful king, instead of death, commanded he be tattooed instead. The punishment was presumably 2-fold: to inflict pain but also to leave a mark that would forever label the person a criminal. – Japan experienced a time in which penal tattooing was generally acceptable. Criminals were often tattooed with symbols indicated the physical location where their crimes were committed. However, an important change had occurred by the end of the 17th century. Criminals began covering their penal tattoos with decorative ones and the punishment became obsolete. This is thought to be the historical origin of the association of tattooing and organized crime in Japan. – Pictorial tattooing flourishes due, in part, to the development of woodblock prints and the needs of popular culture in Edo. Due to its association with criminal activity, the government outlawed tattooing. Its illegal status, along with its painfulness and permanence, solidifies the art form as a symbol of loyalty amongst yakuza gangs. – tattooing gets another push from popular Chinese graphic novel Suikoden, which features many heroes adorned with tattoos. Various artists of the time produced their own interpretations of these characters. The story still remains popular to this day. – tattooing remains outlawed but artists were allowed to set up shop servicing foreign sailors. Their skills were well regarded and attracted distinguished clients like King George V and Czar Nicholas II. They also continued to tattoo Japanese clients illegally. – tattooing in Japan remained illegal until the end of WWII when General MacArthur liberalized the Japanese laws. Today, tattoos remain largely unaccepted.  If you’re Japanese and you get a tattoo in Japan, you’re essentially signing a non-participatory agreement for public baths, swimming pools, water parks and other places where skin is shown. If you’re a foreigner in Japan, don’t assume you’re going to get a free pass. You may, but you also may not. And because it’s probably often used as an excuse, stickers and temporary tattoos aren’t allowed either.  For understandable reasons, Japan has not had a good relationship with tattoos, to say the least. And in a conformist society the act of using your body as a canvas is seen as both rebellious and threatening. But absurd? What seems absurd to me is the government spending taxpayer money investigating what their own employees do with their bodies. And, in a time when the economy is struggling and a certain region (*cough Osaka) is facing major power shortages this summer. But then again, there’s never been much room for individuality in Japan. If you’re wondering what’s going to happen to the employees who were caught ink-handed, they’re receiving an appropriate punishment. The government plans to relocate all employees with tattoos to positions that don’t require contact with other citizens. After conducting an extensive survey across nationwide hot springs last year, the Japan Tourism body found that over half don’t allow those with tattoos to enter their baths. In response, the tourism agency “has asked spa operators to allow tattoo-sporting foreign tourists into their facilities in a bid to get more overseas visitors experiencing the nation’s .”  source: vanishingtattoo | The Tattoo History Sourcebook","post_categories":["Graphic Design"],"post_tags":["history","ink","tattoo"],"date":"May 17, 2012"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"ChibiDashi miniature jewelry drawer","content":"How adorable is this little dude?

A passerby called in a bomb threat after noticing the sculpture installation. The NYPD arrested Miyakawa while a bomb squad verified that the sculptures were non-threatening. The designer and four of his colleagues co-operated with the police, repeatedly explaining that the hanging bags were an art-installation, and not explosives. At an arraignment on Sunday, May 20, 2012 the prosecution recommended that the judge fix bail, while his lawyer, Deborah J Blum, characterized Miyakawa’s arrest as a gross misunderstanding as evidenced by his many accomplishments in the field of design . The Honorable Martin Murphy decided to hold Miyakawa for a mental evaluation, extending his detainment for an additional 30 days. The 50-year-old designer relocated Tokyo to New York City 23 years ago, working for the renowned New York architect Rafael Vinoly. Miyakawa established his solo design practice, Takeshi Miyakawa Design, in 2001. Via Gothamist : Miyakawa is currently still in custody. A facebook group has been set up where you can find, among other things, people and addresses to write to, requesting Miyakawa be set free. Takeshi is currently being held at Rikers Island without bail. After spending 4 nights in prison without trial, Takeshi was just released from prison without bail! He must return to court on June 21 for a psychiatric evaluation, but justice has been served. Under the terms of the ACD (adjournment in contemplation of dismissal) ruling on 19 July, Miyakawa will walk free as long as he stays out of trouble for the next six months. He has also been ordered to serve ten days of community service. We’re all relieved that this issue has been resolved and that now Takeshi-san can go back to making great design work.

The relatively low-profile artist was selected from a group of art industry heavyweights that included Tadashi Kawamata , On Kawara , Yoko Ono and Hiroshi Sugimoto . Given the impending focus on the artist, this seems like a fine time to review Tanaka’s previous work. Tanaka is obsessed with the endlessly mundane choices we face in our life and how a single question (“what should we have for lunch?”) can branch out into fifty different topics, from restaurants to food to ingredients to childhood memories until, “at times I just forget about the question I’ve had in mind.” Throughout the 2000’s Tanaka created a series of videos in which he demonstrates mind-numbingly complicated procedures to approach some very mundane tasks like getting into a house, drawing a line or closing the doors on a vehicle. His more recent work requires a bit more dedication in that, instead of 2 – 6 minute videos he is now producing 60-minute videos. But conceptually, “A Piano Played by Five Pianists at Once (First Attempt)” (2012) and “A Haircut by 9 Hairdressers at Once (Second Attempt)” (2010) both follow a narrative structure, distancing them from their more nonsensical earlier brethren. In both works a group of people are given a seemingly difficult challenge. The loophole – very few rules. At its core, the videos are about human experience, and how we understand it – themes which Tanaka plans to build upon for his proposed installation next year. He will, of course, incorporate Japan’s greatest collective experience, the March 2011 Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami. According to the proposal, one of the filmed challenges will be for office workers to descend an emergency stairway of a high-rise as quietly as possible, as well as a more politically-charged piece dealing with the electricity industry.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["venice biennial"],"date":"May 22, 2012"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Nintendo Characters as Ukiyo-e Prints","content":"Link from Zelda | click images to enlarge Mega Man/Rockman and his trusty sidekick, Rush.

Speaking about 1Q84 , Murakami himself said, “I had a kind of premonition it’s going to be a big book. It’s going to be very ambitious.” Like his other books, 1Q84 is chock-full of obscure references that make you wish it came with its own musical soundtrack, literary appendix and history lesson. The story, like much of Japanese culture, is also heavily garnished with meals; we learn what Aomame eats to prevent constipation, as well as what Ushikawa fixes himself while on a stakeout. Dennis Gilstad , an art student at Cooper Union , has created an equally epic and stunning infographic for his graduation show that charts and visualizes all the meals that occur throughout Murakami’s latest opus. Dennis tells me that he was actually influenced by Japanese architecture firm SANAA ( previously ) and their programmatic approach to using the line to define spatial relationships.

How? By unleashing various cycling routes around the city that trace outlines of animals. There’s a panda that peruses Shibuya, a gorilla that goes to Haneda and even a zebra that zooms through my old neighborhood of Kichijoji. The different animals were chosen based on requests they received on twitter. A team of cartographers then drew out animal-shaped routes on a map. But in all its topographic greatness, the project also has an interactive component, which of course involves a purchase. With Sony’s NAV-U personal navigation system (about 24,000 yen) you can try out all the routes yourself. You can even create new routes. The navigation system even logs cool stats like distance traveled and calories burned. But with a little creativity we can all try out these routes without making the purchase. Tokyo Zoo Project is a nominee for a Webby Award this year in the “Best Visual Design-Function” category (which is how I discovered the project).

No – this is not your typical bubble bath. I love the shape of this bath, which incorporates the look of overflowing suds into the design. This is the most satisfying, round, bulbous, voluptuous bathtub I have ever seen. In Japan, the bathtub is more than just a part of the bathroom where you wash away grime and dirt. It’s a place where people go to relax their mind and soul. LIXIL’s new bathtub uses air, hot water and a special foaming agent that, unlike typical soap suds, is so unabrasive (I know, that’s not a word) you can theoretically soak in them for as long as you like. But the foam isn’t only for pleasure. It forms a thick layer, insulating the water and preventing steam from escaping.

And to commemorate the opening,  Texas’ Rice University Art Gallery has invited Yasuaki Onishi to create a site-specific installation that, albeit in a different fashion, also exhibits massive space and volume. Onishi once said in a statement describing his work: Where Taniguchi’s new building is clearly a development, Onishi’s is an antidevelopment: reversing sculpture, as Onishi would put it. He uses the simplest of materials – translucent plastic sheeting, strings of black glue, fishing line – to create spatial forms that render the illusion of mountainous objects that have been removed, or perhaps are invisible, leaving only an outline. His monumental sculptures are at once imposing, but also are void of any mass of their own, as if acting to define their own negative space.

The pronunciation of their name is fairly straightforward except for the “N” – the deeper and more nasal sound you produce, the better. The enigmatic trio hails from Hyogo prefecture, Japan and, contrary to what their name would have you believe, is comprised of 2 boys (Maya Love and Shinosuke Boys) and 1 girl (Linda Dada). With underage girl and boy idol groups dominating the charts in Japan (I have difficulty even calling them “music charts”), these Boys bring a refreshing sound to the stage of J-Pop. Speaking of stage, their performances are quite entertaining too, as the trio rotate instruments depending on the vibe of the show. The strange power-pop trio formed in 2007, under the Tower of The Sun , as the story goes. Their sound (as well as their antics) is reminiscent of The Blue Hearts . But that’s understandable considering their producer is Masahide Sakuma, who worked with the mid-80s punk rock band.

They formed a human chain around it, calling on Japan’s government to abandon atomic energy on the anniversary of the tsunami that sparked the Fukushima atomic disaster. Matsumoto handed out hundreds of his middle finger candles, which the protestors happily accepted. As the candles burn, the middle finger melts away, leaving a sadly deformed stump of a hand.

Dockside areas and industrial zones are subject to rapid change, unlike the sea, which remains constant. And it is at the waterfront where the distortion created between the flow of time comes together. Kawakubo went to many lengths to capture that eerie sense of time. His photos were shot under twilight and are the result of many trial-and-error shutter speeds.

So I’m not quite ready to chalk this up as a Tokyo trend, but it’s certainly interesting to see the emergence of another “retail village.” I’m speaking, obviously, of Yoyogi Village , the new urban oasis that just opened during November of last year – 1 month earlier than its sisterly Daikanyama T-site . The similarities between the facilities are obvious: both boast a roster of rock-star creatives, they offer their own version of carefully curated retail shops and they target a specific sophisticated audience. Where daikanyama T-site staked out their specialty in the realm of books, Yoyogi Village claims music as their forte. Yoyogi Village is divided into two zones: container zone and village zone. Akin to the street of souvenir stores that greet you when you enter Disneyland, the former is dedicated to a handful of specialty retail shops nestled away in, as the name hints, shipping containers. As you progress deeper into the site you come to the village zone, which houses the main attraction: code kurkku; a restaurant serving up Italian organic cuisine. Its executive chef, Yasuhiro Sasajima, hails from Il Ghiottone – a notoriously hard-to-get-a-table restaurant in Kyoto. For more on the restaurant head over to Robbie Swinnerton’s article . Caution: be sure to bring a drool bucket. Yoyogi Village is the brainchild of Takeshi Kobayashi , a musician and record producer known for his work with household J-pop names like Mr. Children, Southern All Stars and Remioromen. He’s supported in his venture by recording artist Shinichi Osawa (aka Mondo Grosso). The two collaborated in 2009 to form the duo Bradberry Orchestra , so it’s understandable that these musical heavyweights went out of their way to ensure that the “Music Bar” – one of the pinnacles of their main restaurant – lives up to all their acoustical standards. Helping to achieve the overall look-and-feel of urban oasis is self-proclaimed “plant hunter” Seijun Nishihata , who is in charge of the landscaping.

As we all know, after the tsunami knocked out the cooling systems at Fukushima Daiichi triggering nuclear meltdowns, inhabitants within a 20km radius faced mandatory evacuation. This area, now known as the exclusion zone, will not be habitable for decades. Yet plant life has no choice but to stay. For his latest project, Radio Active Plantron , Dogane has taken plants continuously exposed to mild radiation (equal to levels in Tokyo, which are said to pose no health risk) and wired them up to his system. He is broadcasting their “voices” over ustream (below). The stream will be accessible through May 14, 2012. The project is hosted by piece unique , a website that connects artists with micro-patrons. If you like the project you can make a donation – part of which will go to Sakura Line 311 , a charity organization that is planting cherry trees along the line where the tsunami reached. Mankind is not burdened with the ability to hear the voices of plants, but what if that were not the case? How would life have been different? Would we have constructed monstrous nuclear power plants that emit poisonous particles?","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["2011 earthquake"],"date":"March 29, 2012"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Small House in Shinjuku by Junpei Nousaku Architects","content":"Tokyo is plagued with small houses. Rather, small plots of land. So much so that it prompted the government to issue a manual for controlling land compartmentalization because they were concerned that it could lead to a decline in quality of life. Indeed, in order to maximize living space homes are often constructed around the limits of the perimeter, with floors stacked on each other, creating dark spaces that feel secluded from the community. Junpei Nousaku Architects ’ antidote is displayed in their most recent home, completed in July of 2011. The communal living room is situated on the ground floor. And instead of stacking another floor above it, the ceiling is vaulted a full 3-floors all the way to the roof, achieving the unachievable in terms of scale. The exterior is also impressive and hardly resembles a private residence. The finished home, the architects say, is actually an attempt to create an unfinished space that will engage with or, at times, clash with, the surrounding environment. So the moral of the story? When it comes to small spaces, less is more. source: architecturephoto","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["architecture-residential","small spaces"],"date":"March 30, 2012"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Link Roundup of April Fools Internet Pranks in Japan | 2012","content":"Here’s a roundup of links to April Fool’s internet pranks in Japan on April 1, 2012 or, as some refer to it, the day when the internet is very annoying: ","post_categories":["notes from the editors"],"post_tags":["random ramblings"],"date":"March 31, 2012"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"We are all radioactive","content":"We are all radioactive is a documentary film project organized by my friend and ASIJ senpai Lisa Katayama .

In many cases, women who previously supported their husbands in the fishing industry, were left with nothing to do and no sense of purpose. OCICA is a new brand of jewelry that is attempting to end that cycle and put these women back to work.

Below the midpoint – at 36,000 km – would be the terminal station, which would house labs and housing.

Or perhaps the plot of a niche-market Harry Potter sequel (Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Antiseismic Architect?) However, the technology is real; and it’s being implemented all across Japan – at 88 sites, to be exact (based on company data as of 06/2011). Air Danshin Systems Inc. (danshin sort of means antisiesmic) was originally established in 2005 to market and sell the technology, which was invented by a man named Youichi Sakamoto. There’s a lengthy interview with him here (PDF, all in Japanese) if you’re interested. In theory the mechanism is really quite simple: 1. A sensor detects the rumblings of an earthquake. 2. Within .5 to 1 second an air tank pushes air in-between an artificial foundation and the actual structure of the home, lifting it as high as 3cm off the ground. 3. While the earth below violently shakes, the levitating home quietly and patiently waits, returning back to the ground once the tectonic plates have settled. In addition, the company claims that it’s a low-cost alternative to other earthquake-proofing. On average it’s supposedly 1/3 the cost of other systems and requires very little maintenance. I’m impressed to see that they’re also marketing their technology to larger facilities like laboratories and factories that often house sensitive, delicate and potentially hazardous material. I’m thinking nuclear power plants. If there was a way to implement this technology beneath the country’s 50-some power plants that would really be something.

It was started by Hiroyuki Murase, a graduate of the prestigious Kunstakademie Duesseldorf who, after refining his design skills in an academic setting, returned home to fuse innovation into a tradition his family has carried with them for over a century. The tradition is known as – literally, to wring, squeeze and press – and is a 400-year old technique in itself to refine fabric through a process that embodies it’s own name; wringing, squeezing and pressing. The results are quite spectacular, giving birth to incredibly tactile and unique textures. They remind me a lot of this washi paper clothing . I think my favorite are the (drip) pendant lamps pictured directly below. So gorgeous! Murase recently exhibited suzusan at maison et objet 2012 earlier this year.

Take, for example, Fujifilm’s campaign for their Fujicolor disposable camera. Their catchphrase, (let’s capture New Years, let’s capture it with Fujicolor) led to a phenomenal streak of never-ending commercials and celebrity cameos, as well as huge sales in disposable cameras. It was reported that, at their peak around 2003, Fujifilm was shipping about 120 million of their iconic cameras a year. But we all know the next few chapters of the tragic story. First came digital cameras, then came the iPhone and now all those sales numbers feel like a long lost dream. But one thing wasn’t lost – the catchphrase. If you say to someone, “oshogatsu wo utsuso” (let’s capture New Year), 9 times out of 10 – guaranteed – they will reciprocate with “Fujicolor de utsuso.” Try it. It’s fun. However, that’s not the end of the story. Sometimes products can be reincarnated.

His subject matter is often banal – a traditional toy, a zipper or a tree stump. In the most literal sense, Yasuhiro Suzuki is devoted to the design of daily life. So I was excited to hear he had a new book out covering some of his recent works. Blinking and Flapping encompasses works that were on display at Suzuki’s major retrospective, which took place late last year at the Hamamatsu Museum of Art . The gorgeous book is now on sale through Amazon Japan (2,625 yen) – they ship overseas! Here are a few of my favorite projects from the retrospective last year :   In this playful and somewhat nostalgic piece, the traditional kendama toy gets a makeover with a bright red apple. The “Temple of the Silver Pavilion” gets a silver wrapping and a sweet filling. Talk about good taste!    (left) and (right)  A poetic timepiece that replaces the hourglass with a kitchen utensil.  An installation of leaves with open and closed eyes printed on the front and back. They blink as they flutter down. Magical!  This is my absolute favorite piece. Suzuki created a boat-shaped zipper based on a model he had done back in 2004. The waves it created as it drove across the inland sea created the teeth of the zipper. How cool is that!?

Before opening its doors in July 2011, the 30-year old oddly shaped building was given a brand new renovation by interior designer Noi Shigemasa . The building itself is an elegant piece of exposed concrete that is completely flat, except for the entrance way and a single floor-to-ceiling glass window on the ground level. The window creates a heightened sense of anticipation, setting the stage for what’s to come but not revealing everything. I entered the first floor gallery space, known as gallery yoluca, where staff were busy setting up an exhibition that was opening the next day. Yoluca is a portmanteau of the words sumika (habitat) and yoru (to stop by). Much in the same way that mortar, Japanese sugi wood and glass – all in their most basic forms – come together, the name yoluca carries a strong hope that different people will come together in the space, forming new connections and exchanging new ideas.  It’s a theme that carries through the entire space, and I came to realize this as I continued my visit. As I walked up the concrete staircase I came to Sabi Bar on the 2nd floor. This is a fascinating space with defined blocks of wood that, in turn, helps to define the purpose of the space. It’s clearly a bar where booze – that facilitator of discussion and connection – is served. But what makes the space unique is the artists and designers showing in the gallery are invited to tend the bar, where they interact with the guests on an entirely different level. Continuing my ascent I arrived at the 3rd floor meeting room known as Sabi no Ma.

But the significant relationships are created not by the object dictating its function, but rather by us, the user, engaging with the object and defining the function. From ambiguous forms rise curiosity and inquisition, thus inviting personal and subjective interpretation. Canada-based designer Miya Kondo created these “Objects of Empathy,” a symbolic representation of an ideal relationship to objects. The sculptural forms are simple, stoic and beautiful, yet they are wholly ambiguous. With no agenda of their own they present themselves as malleable sponges, ready to be defined by the user.

The creative lab that just formed last year have been doing a number of music videos for the Japanese band androp , including a spectacle of a show that used 250 Canon SLRs . But their latest video is pretty great, and I like the track too. In what is perhaps the first direct tie-up between buyable products and music, PARTY is giving the term “product placement” a whole new meaning. The video was inspired by the heavily dance-influenced track, but also by the lyrics, which sings about the different languages spoken around the world and how each language casts its own glow of hope upon mankind. The group decided to create a series of high-tech toys that move and dance in response to music – that universal language that every culture can relate to. Each toy is unique, signifying our diversity. All 10 toys will eventually be put up for sale through ebay but for now only the cute little rocker is available.

But for artist Riusuke Fukahori , the goldfish was not just a relic of long-lost childhood. As he painfully lay in his room one night, struggling and suffering, about to give up on his art, he looked over and saw a goldfish. His neglected fish of 7 years sputtered about in a cesspool of mold and feces – a common fate endured by most festival souvenirs. Fukahori felt a shiver run down his spine. What he suddenly saw was a beautiful animal, glowing in bright red, living and surviving. The artist pulled out his paint and set to work, immediately triggering some sort of chemical reaction in his brain. Fukahori had looked far and wide – in Europe, the U.S. and Japan – for his muse. But in an instantaneous form of enlightenment he knew that all along it was right there in his room, inside that dirty fish tank. The goldfish, writes Fukahori, was my salvation.

The show, which runs through February 11, 2012, primarily features Kawara’s series of Date Paintings, which he started in 1966. The minimal works consist of nothing but the date on which the painting was executed – a mark, or fragment if you will, of his existence on that particular day. If Kawara is unable to complete a painting during a single day it is destroyed. In case you were wondering what sculpted time looks like, now you know. My personal experience in interacting with Kawara’s paintings has not been pleasant. Although visually they are as quiet as can be, I find them incredibly loud. As I stare at them I’m ironically assaulted by all the chaotic possibilities of that single day. I think if I stayed too long my head would explode. While it would appear that stencils were used to achieve the uniformity seen in each work, every date was skillfully hand-painted – Kawara preferred it that way.  But his obsessive-compulsive behavior didn’t end there. He also methodically and meticulously recorded every painting in a journal, from a color swatch of the paint mixture he used to a year and a letter indicating its size.  It is with great sadness that we have learned that On Kawara has passed away.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["sculpture","time"],"date":"January 10, 2012"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Japanese Designer New Years Cards 2012","content":"It’s become a tradition of some sort.

UK-based indistrial designer Tomoko Azumi showed off her prized stamp collection in her New Years card. Because the dragon is the only fictitious animal to appear in the 12 zodiac animals, the sea horse (tatsu no otoshigo; 竜の落とし子) is often used as a motif instead.

The Japanese interface is a bit difficult to navigate so here are the download links for Mac and Windows . The M+ fonts are quite beautiful. They’re free and feature proportional and fixed-halfwidth Latin, as well as fixed-fullwidth Japanese. Here is the English interface when you can download from.   The AXIS font is not free.

No, definitely not,” he says – Tomii has quite literally turned the tables on himself, accepting that art is something incomprehensible.

Here’s what you’ll need to get started: First, go out and pick some pinecones and find some rocks. Then come home and decorate them. You can paint the pinecone, use glue to attach ornaments, or both. If you like, go ahead and paint your rock as well! Once it’s decorated, use a glue gun and dab some glue to the bottom of the pinecone. Then place it onto the rock. Hold in place until the glue dries (about 2 min). And that’s really all there is to it. Now you have your very own miniature Christmas tree! It’s a simple, fun activity that can help kids realize and appreciate the wonderful small things that are often right under our feet – we just need to look for them.","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["DIY","Kids","miniature"],"date":"December 12, 2011"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"En-gi green furniture by mono goen","content":" “The earth and tree” | inspired by the song .

Dubbed Daikanyama T-Site, it’s operated by CCC (Culture, Convenience Club), the parent company of media rental giant Tsutaya. And by “quietly” I’m not referring to physical size – at 12000 sq meters and 3 buildings the place is huge – but rather an odd discreetness that is rare when it comes to such commercial endeavors. For example, there was no opening ceremony. And I couldn’t find a single press release from the company announcing it. There isn’t even a large sign on site advertising its own presence. The location is also odd. Situated roughly 5 minutes away from Daikanyama station, it can’t compete with the convenience of (front-of-the-station) retail outlets. And yet it’s regal self assurance is inspiring – so grounded and rounded as if knowing she is held securely in the palm of the neighborhood. This is perhaps, in part, due to the considered design, which is the work of Tokyo-based architects Klein Dytham . I love the tessellated Ts that adorn the facades of the main buildings. And the interiors are rounded-out by some fantastic signage by Kenya Hara . Although the main space is Tsutaya Books, it’s complemented by a carefully curated ensemble of hobby/lifestyle shops that include a bar and a café as well as a camera and bicycle shop. And upon closer examination, the whole concept reveals some pretty drastic deviations from any preconceived notion of what a bookstore is. For example, the glaring omission of comic books and study guides, the pinnacle of student culture, replaced by now-defunct magazine titles like Heibon Punch and Taiyo . It’s as if they went out of their way to say, “sorry teenagers and anyone under 35. There’s nothing here for you. Now move along.” In many ways the new concept is a return to their roots, which date back to 1983. The company opted to shrink their hip western character name “Tsutaya” and replace it with the original Japanese “蔦谷.” Whether their strategy and execution to target the middle-age and senior baby-boomers will play out is yet to be seen. However, it seems to me they’re on the right track. CCC’s main customers are currently between age 20 – 30. And with a shrinking population, the company was only destined to relive the 2 ways Ernest Hemingway describes a man going broke: “gradually then suddenly.” source: @jeansnow pimping the hell out of it on twitter","post_categories":["Architecture","Go and See"],"post_tags":["books","Kenya Hara","Klein Dytham","storefront design","tokyo guide","tokyo guide play","tsutaya"],"date":"December 16, 2011"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Lettering wizards of House Industries turn the Maison Hermès Tokyo storefront into a carousel","content":" The talented folks at Delaware-based House Industries have worked their magic on the Maison Hermes Tokyo storefront, (type) setting an alphabetic equestrian in the display window.

Nestled within a quaint residential (yet high-end!) neighborhood of Omotesando lies Omotesando Koffee – a shop so unassuming that entering it feels like walking into someone’s private courtyard. In fact, simply stumbling upon it is probably a rare occurrence. If 3 college students hadn’t been sitting on the bench outside I wouldn’t have known they were open for business.   The shop, which was opened and is attended by barista Eiichi Kunitomo, has been in existence less than a year but has already appealed to coffee aficionados (and design-conscious coffee aficionados, but more on that below) around Tokyo. And while the current house it occupies is set to be demolished next year, all hope is not lost. Kunitomo plans to relocate his one-man operation of dripping goodness to another location in Tokyo. The minimalist logo and identity, as well as the box-like steel frame structure are the work of Eding:Post , who worked together with Kunitomo to communicate his concept of impermanence. (If you’re interested you can read our other posts on Eding:Post ) The steel frame structure, and what’s inside it, represents the essence of what the store is all about. Everything else is simply a vessel, serving many needs but essentially replaceable when the time comes to move one. I look forward to seeing how Kunitomo’s steel box structure, coffee shop and all, evolves and adapts to its future home.

Time to look back on Japan’s best products of 2011 according to ad agency Dentsu . In case this is your first time with these lists, Dentsu considers people, places and events, products as well. Take it as it is, but I kind of like looking back on what was on the minds of many Japanese; or at least what Japan’s mass media wanted on their minds. Oh and the same rules apply: selection is based on 4 major categories – sales, ingenuity, market-creation and influence. Curious about what was big last year or the year before? Check out the previous lists .  Once again the smartphone reigns supreme, maintaining its top place on this list. Yano Research expects just over 20 million smartphone shipments in Japan in 2011, which represents an impressive 250% increase compared to last year. But then again, any new and shiny device could probably boast similar numbers. Let’s move on.  In the wake of the Tohoku tsunami, earthquake and nuclear disaster, one mentality that helped bring a stricken nation together was its citizens collective effort to conserve electricity. As you’ll see, energy-saving devices is a theme that will make several appearances on this list. Pictured above is Panasonic’s LED light bulb (LDAHV4L27CG). It was noted for its use of clear glass, while its LED light source resembles a filament that can effectively disperse light in all directions. It offers a lifespan of 40,000 hours.  As the new tower for terrestrial digital broadcasting climbs higher – closer towards its 2012 completion – so does it’s place on this list (up 3 ranks from last year). As construction progressed, it was announced back in March that the tower had officially become the world’s tallest free standing tower. But it also set another, more unfortunate, record – a spike in road deaths caused be pedestrians and motorists alike who were apparently taking their eyes off the road to admire the attraction.  Nadeshiko Japan is the nickname given to the Japanese women’s soccer league. They gloriously defeated the United States in the Women’s World Cup finals in July, a time when the country desperately needed a morale boost. At one point it was reported that almost 28% of the population tuned in to watch their underdogs defeat one of the world’s top-ranked teams.  image courtesy livedoor The all-girl idol group with an average age in the mid-to-high teens. They had a pretty fantastic year. To borrow the words of The Bruce Dickinson, these girls put their mini-skirts on just like the rest of us – one leg at a time. Except once their mini-skirts are on they make gold records!  Thanks to a robust following of otaku supporters who are seemingly immune to the economy, their 2011 singles – sakura no ki ni narou , Everyday kachusha and Flying Get – all catapulted into the millions soon after release.  Mana Ashida, a 7-year old child actress, swept Japan with kawaii fever after starring in several high-profile TV series, as well as a couple variety shows. She released a solo album (yes she can sing too) on November 23, which landed her 8th in the oricon weekly top 10 chart.  Hybrid cars got a boost from eco-conscious consumers looking for further ways to save on resources other than their own. Pictured above is the Honda FREED , a much anticipated hybrid minivan that just recently went on sale.  There’s a big difference between strategically devising a contingency plan and panicky housewives going out and stockpiling natto . Both were results of the earthquake and tsunami but the lasting impact had to do with the prior. The devastating realities in the wake of the tragedy served as a chilling reminder that it can’t hurt to be prepared. Some of the more popular survival foods that people decided to include in their survival kits were kanpan (hardtack), cup ramen and instant curry.  Although not as energy-efficient as their hand-powered brethren, the electric fan became a popular replacement for air conditioners in the country’s communal attempt to conserve electricity Although falling a few ranks versus last year, the chideji TVs managed to squeeze onto the top 10 as the country phased out their analog broadcasting over the summer. Procrastinating consumers raced to secure uninterrupted television service, casually ignoring the fact that all you really need is an 8000-yen chideji tuner.

Participating in the show was the Brooklyn-based Japanese designer Takeshi Miyakawa , who combined the concept of a candle and chandelier to create “Candelier.” Carved entirely from wax, the sculpture is as exquisite as it is ephemeral.

With a cremation rate of 99.85% (2008 data), Japan and their corpse count, or lack thereof, would seem an ideal place to to ride out a plague of the undead. In the text that follows I would like to analyze the pros and cons of the East vs. the West, so that each of us can make informed decisions regarding our own contingency plans for the impending zombie pandemic. First, when we model out the spread of a zombie pandemic the most essential question is its origination. If the zombie outbreak first originates outside of Japan, and there are no signs of lengthy incubation periods, an initial assessment of the situation may justly lead many to flee to Japan as soon as possible. With very few corpses lying around in the ground, and an ocean surrounding the country, Japan seems to be ideally positioned as a place to not get your brains chewed out. However, in an entirely different scenario, where the outbreak occurs in Japan, one can easily imagine the devastating consequences of being in the land of the rising dead. In a previous essay , Jim Hawe makes some excellent assertions that question the core of Japan’s safety profile.  First of all, the geographic make-up of Japan could be tragically disadvantageous. Densely populated urban areas serve as ideal feeding grounds. And very little land to actually run to, coupled with the likely probability that other countries would deny you entry due to fear of contamination, certainly raises questions about Japan’s zombie outbreak preparedness. The lack of guns and other heavy artillery has served Japan well in maintaing a safe, civil and peaceful society over the years. But, just a equally, this will be a crippling weakness as the unaffected desperately search for means to fend off their attackers. Although popularized as an ideal weapon in the Max Brooks novel “ World War Z ,” in reality any type of samurai sword would prove much more problematic than one might imagine. “Bladed weapons in general are not ideal because they will inevitably get stuck in things and become dull,” said Matt Mogk, founder and head researcher of Zombie Research Society (ZRS). There is an important component that often gets overlooked when analyzing the fundamental zombie preparedness of Japan. And that is the cultural, and I would argue, genetic, differences between eastern and western zombies. For those who are not familiar, allow me to introduce the kyonshi (殭屍), the Asian zombie. Claiming ancestry in China, the kyonshi (which terrified the sh*t out of me as a child) have several noteworthy characteristics that, I would argue, make them less competitive compared to their Western counterparts. Currently the only known way to quiet a zombie is to bash their brains in. This is a task that is as difficult as it is gruesome, and only slightly easier if aided by a shotgun. However, can be sedated by tactically placing a small scroll with buddhist inscriptions on the forehead (as pictured above). Also, (and this helps in assisting the first objective) are legally blind. They detect human presence from the smell of our breath, making a cornered escape realistically possible by simply holding your breath. are also known to have hardened joints, rendering their arms and legs inflexible. They mobilize their bodies by hopping, extending their arms in front of them to maintain balance. While this can serve as an initial disadvantage, it is worth pointing out that, over time, their joints are known to soften, allowing them to walk and in some cases even run. There is scientific literature that backs up the claim that hate mirrors and being pissed on. So as long as you have your vanity and stay hydrated you have several choices for defense, without resorting to shotguns and crowbars. Which leads me to my final point. Despite their obvious non-competitive traits, should not be taken lightly. As Sun Tzu famously wrote in Art of War, “know thy enemy.” So store this information in an accessible location. It will undoubtedly serve you well as you seek survival.

Can you believe we’re heading into 2012? I certainly can’t. If you’re interested, please check out our previous posts, which include 2009 calenders! oh no! , 2010 calendars! oh my! and 2011 Calendars! Oh crap! . Chie Tanaka’s rainbow “Pullout Calendar” was produced in collaboration with Takeo Paper and will be exhibited/sold (5,250 yen) at Mitsukoshi Department Store in conjunction with Designtide Tokyo 2011. Also in collaboration with Takeo Paper is Kei Matsushita’s “Graph Calendar” (15,750 yen). It’s an upright calendar and you flip the days as the year progress. It comes in 4 different colors. Yusaku Shimoyama’s “Surge” calendar is made from one sheet of paper and becomes three dimensional when assembled to look like an architect model. Available at the MoMA Store ($10.95)   Hiroyuki Miyake‘s “Measure Calendar” works like a retractable tape measure, with one centimeter for each day of the year. And of course, our roundup of calendars wouldn’t be complete without an appearance from graphic design office D-BROS . First up is “Roll12” (above) by Ryosuke Uehara, in which the motion of flipping from month-to-month becomes part of the design, creating a visually dynamic calendar. “Family” by Atsushi Hirano is a continuation of a series in which the designer incorporates animals into the typefaces of the days. Lastly, their “typeface” calendar, which has been rotating through popular typefaces since 2008, is back again; this time with the “century” family.","post_categories":["Graphic Design"],"post_tags":["Calendars","chie tanaka","dbros","hiroyuki miyake"],"date":"October 27, 2011"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Good Design Award 2011 | consumer services","content":"Amongst the winners in the consumer services category, in my opinion, there’s really only one design that deserves a mention.

Mao Fujimoto, a student at the prestigious Tama Arts University , has redesigned the children’s fairytale, adding another dimension of true interactivity. Big Book is precisely that – a children’s story that unfolds into a gigantic single sheet, revealing an oversized graphic of something central to the story. Fujimoto was inspired by a keen fascination about what it would be like to ride on the turtle, which carries the young fisherman to a sub-sea palace in Urashima Taro , one of Japan’s most beloved stories.   And each illustration stands alone as a gorgeous work of artistry, all by the hand of Fujimoto. Amongst her series of 5 stories, perhaps the most visually striking is the deep, dark whole featured in Alice in Wonderland. The listeners and storytellers alike can get on top of the whole book, reorienting themselves around it as they become immersed in the story, experiencing it with all 5 senses. I have nothing against digital books, but an experience like this can still only be achieved in analog and Fujimoto presents a masterful way of doing it.

He is insanely young and talented – perhaps one of the more coveted up-and-coming architects in Japan right now. Although given the fact that his office has recently bulged to a staff of almost 20 (including 1 dog), “up-and-coming” is a bit of a misnomer. The idyllic and peaceful layout was presumably designed to coexist with nature. In fact, the architect has a penchant for merging the indoors and outdoors. This characteristic – you can’t discuss this home without talking about it – is most apparent in his choice to incorporate the rather traditional (or ancient) , or earthen floor, throughout the entire house. The acts as a hallway, dictating the movement of residents from one room to another. Inconvenient? Indeed, some may find it so.  But for the environment-concious inhabitants it’s turns out to be  graceful solution to creating invisible boundaries while adding depth and richness to the interior.

The 2011 Kokuyo Design Awards were announced last week and the grand prize went to Roll Table, a clever reinterpretation of your standard children’s coloring pad.  Inspired by memories of scribbling on tables and floors, the piece was designed by Kobe Ishou Sourenjo (神戸意匠操練所), a Kobe-based group of 3 young designers. The genius of Roll Table lies in its ability to transform a roll of paper into an actual drawing table. I know it sound simple, but indulge me. While many art easels come with a roll of paper, it’s hidden from sight. By bringing it to the foreground and making the infinite qualities of a roll of paper more salient and perceptible – not to mention interactive! – Roll Paper manages to imbed a new dynamic into the act of drawing.

I’ve made it clear how I feel about these awards but one of my main qualms is that the award is overly dispensed. Out of about 3000 applicants the award is given to about 1000. To me, a 33% chance of winning seems like a lot. But it’s understandable that the JPD, who sponsors the awards, wants to stamp their seal of approval on as many products as they can because, according to their site, “the purpose of the Good Design Award is to support companies and designers so they can introduce their products out to the world with confidence.” Compare it, for example, to the international Red Dot awards . Odds of winning are anywhere between 6% and 20%, depending on the category. But I’m just trying to put things in perspective. Unless you’re in the top 15, which have yet to be announced, the awards are hardly prestigious. Oh, and along with the top 15, my favorite category, the frontier design category, has yet to be announced so I’ll be doing a follow-up post probably in early November. Anyway, like last year, this year’s judging platform was chaired by industrial designer Naoto Fukasawa and vice-chaired by graphic designer Taku Satoh . In addition, a group of 3-4 designers are assigned to each category, which spans everything from sports and tableware to automotive and even business plans.

Of the six towers that are part of the planned rebuilding, only two are currently visible: 1 World Trade Center (Freedom Tower) by David Childs (of SOM ) and 4 World Trade Center, by Fumihiko Maki (who coincidentally was also previously employed at SOM ). Maki was educated in Tokyo but made his way to Harvard for his post-graduate work. Up until the early 1990s, Maki was predominantly commissioned in Japan before branching out into the U.S., Germany and then Asia. He is one of four Japanese to have received the prestigious Pritzker Prize (in 1993) and is also credited as being one of the founding fathers of the Metabolism Group , a Japanese post-war architectural movement characterized by “large scale, flexible, and expandable structures that evoked the processes of organic growth.”   Tower 4 is a minimalist structure that, when completed in 2013, will stand at 61 stories high, making it the 4th tallest in the new site. From the ground, visitors will be greeted by a bright, welcoming four-story lobby made of glass. However, when viewed from afar, it is easily the most nondescript of the group. Standing straight and tall with dignity, its one defining feature is a void, chiseled away at the top, producing a trapezoid crown. This, the architect argues, is a subtle yet vital part of the composition that helps create interaction between the other buildings that are part of the master plan. Those who dismiss Tower 4 for being boring, are both right and wrong. They are right in their visual assessment that the structure is mundane and repetitious. But what they fail to realize is that so much of New York City is about the ordinary colliding with the monumental. Ten years ago, when 3000 lives disintegrated, the impact was undoubtedly felt across the world. If you lived in New York, the atrociousness was instantaneous. If you lived elsewhere (I happened to be in Washington DC at the time) it felt like science-fiction and reality slowly blending together. What’s obvious to anyone living in the city now is that we are not waiting on these towers to move on.

Little Manhattan (2007 – 09), which is part of the artist’s solo show at David Zwirner (opening September 20) was painstakingly carved from a block of marble and consists of excruciating detail that was replicated using photographs, Google Earth and several helicopter rides over the city. I do hope the artist was happy where he was working because at 2.5 tones, it’s a bit different from rearranging your furniture. Originally trained as an architect, Sone’s obsession with landscape and construction have led him to produce similar pieces that replicate Hong Kong Island, Los Angeles highway junctions, a mountain range, a section of a rainforest, ski resorts, and his own backyard.

I love the bright color palette, visual interestingness and narrative that defines the work of Matsuyama. But, on a deeper level, what I think I’m most attracted to is the ambiguity in which the artist’s work comfortably rests within the grey area between Japanese and American pop art.     The 35-year old Matsuyama originally fled Tokyo to pursue an art career in NYC – something he felt was far too risky in Japan’s rigid art industry. It was also an attempt to escape the fourth law of thermodynamics – the graphic designer-entropy principle – which states that ambitious, intelligent artists who can’t decide what to do decompose into magazine art directors. He attended the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and currently works out of a studio in Greenpoint. In addition to producing his own art, Matsuyama has also worked with the likes of NIKE and Levi’s on collaborative projects.

Since 2002, Japanese artist Takashi Murakami has been organizing a one-day art extravaganza known as GEISAI that takes place twice a year. Already in its 15th iteration, the latest event for young and budding artists across Japan was cancelled 2 days ahead of its scheduled opening – yet another consequence of the devastating disaster on March 11. However, over the summer organizers pulled together what they are calling “petit GEISAI #15,” a slightly trimmed down version of what was previously known to attract over 10,000 visitors and hundreds of exhibitors. And yet “petit,” while also referring to the 29-year age cutoff, is somewhat of a misnomer. Maddie and I spent the better part of our morning combing through the 200+ participating artists who were just announced earlier this week, in order to select just a handful of what you can expect to see.

But it’s not too late to enjoy some old-school J-horror. Enter Tomiyuki Kaneko, who has made a name for himself by depicting Yokai, a class of supernatural demons in Japanese folklore. The Yokai art arena is largely dominated by Shigeru Mizuki , the  enigmatic author of the ever-popular GeGeGe no kitaro series. However, Kaneko differentiates himself by depicting large-scale creatures with an emphasis on minute detail you won’t find in Shigeru’s comics. Another differentiating feature is that Kaneko’s Yokai lean more towards realism than other artists. As with “Red Tiger,” Kaneko takes his cue from existing animals, which he then re-imagines as demonic “substantiations.” The images are from Kaneko’s recent exhibition, “ Yokai Substantiations ,” which was on display at Mizuma Art Gallery through August 13th.  Want more Yokai to chill your blood?

The new complex is, in a sense, a homecoming for the brand, which was founded in 1986 by Ennio Capasa, fresh from working in Japan as an assistant to Yohji Yamamoto . Along with a retail shop, the complex includes 2 other spaces – CNAC LAB and CNAC WALL. CNAC LAB is a dedicated art space that will begin showing video artwork in October. But from now through the end of the month the space is encompassed by “Costume National: 25Years,” an exhibition designed by Ryuji Nakamura to showcase various archival looks that the brand has produced. (check out all our posts on Ryuji Nakamura) For the event, Nakamura has used over 4000 meters of polyester ribbon that functions like a lenticular print.   Depending on where you stand, the ribbon can appear to be translucent to the point of non-existence, or it can appear to be opaque as a wall. As you approach the exhibition a curtain appears to close on all surrounding work so that, up close, you can only view a single piece at a time. The other space – CNAC WALL – is a bar and terrace with a green wall created by Patrick Blanc .

The sculpture was commissioned by the 911 London Project, an educational charity dedicated to helping students understand what happened on that fateful day.   The structure, which stands tall with resilience, consists of 3 sections of the twin towers: enmeshed girders and a steel plate. However, as is the case with much contemporary art, Ando’s sculpture is not without controversy . Some victims’ families felt that the use of the mangled steel was an overly-graphic representation of the tragic events of 9/11 that would only cause them more grief and pain. In fact, opposition was so great that organizers were forced to relocate the sculpture from its original high-traffic location, outside London’s city hall, to a temporary and notably more discreet location in Battersea Park. Personally, I think it’s a shame that they had to move the sculpture. I think everyone should see it. If there is anyone qualified to construct such a monument, it’s Ando. As we’ve noted in the past , Ando is a descendant of samurai-era Bizen sword makers-turned-Buddhist priests, and she carries on her family’s heritage by primarily working with steel, and with a very minimal aesthetic. But we don’t need emblematic credentials to justify the piece. Much akin to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, a bombed-out dome whose skeleton still stands after the dropping of the atomic bomb, “After 9/11” is a poetic symbol of peace and reflection. It’s a poignant reminder of the strength – and equally, the fragility – of human life. source: Miya Ando newsletter | DailyMail ","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["9/11","Miya Ando"],"date":"September 11, 2011"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Tobetter.us | Post Your Art → Help Japan","content":"Tobetter.us is a pretty interesting idea.

Along with his partner Takuto Usami, Itasaka operates under the studio name H220430 , which stands for Heisei 22 (2010) April, 30, the official start date of his new venture. He got his humble beginnings in the more formal field of architecture working for Kidosaki Architects . As is apparent by their most iconic work, Balloon Bench , a whimsical and fairytale-like piece that captures the hearts of fans of both The Red Balloon and the movie UP , their work lacks both clear functionality and marketability. Yet in a society built upon mass production, mass consumption and the subsequent disposal of objects that no longer provide immediate gratification, there is something incredibly admirable in the work of H220430 and their ability to embed a concept into product design.   The Schwarzwald Stool was rendered the way it is by exposing it to levels of acidity found in acid rain. The stool is named after the Schwarzwald region in Germany where, in the 1960s, highly concentrated acid rain wiped out roughly 60% of the forests. Instead of falling to the ground, the trees gradually lost leaves and died a slow death. The stool itself is fully functional as it has a sealant that prevents further rusting and protects your clothes from rust stains. Balloon Bench  The Balloon Bench was inspired by of the 1953 French film Le Ballon Rouge. Specifically, the final scene where the little boy grabs onto the bunch of balloons and flies away. The bench was intended to put a smile on the face of anyone who interacted with it, much in the same way the movie but a smile on the designer’s face. Mission accomplished! (In case you were wondering, the illusion is created by sculptural balloons that are actually mounted to a ceiling. You can purchase the piece through gallery SOMEWHERE )  One of Itasaka’s most recent projects (and consequently available for purchase later this fall) is the sometimes-mushroom, sometimes-cloud shaped lamp that was designed in response to a complacency towards nuclear weapons. Despite 66 long years since the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, globally we stockpile 23,000 nuclear warheads; enough to annihilate the human race… and then annihilate it again…and again…and again…and again..and again. With Mushroom Lamp, and in all his designs, Itasaka attempts to embed his work with relevant messages – something he calls “secondary communication.” In other words, a subtle message that is not always obvious but was a significant part of the design process. Through his designs Itasaka hopes to evoke a certain consciousness that would push our conceptual thinking into a new stage of dialogue.

And while it’s no secret that Miyazaki embedds his films with symbolism and underlying themes on topics like religion and the environment, Miyazaki himself has laregely avoided the active debate by maintaining a carefully calculated grey line between entertainment and activism (his tendency to evade interviews has also assisted him on that front). However, in 1995 his studio created a music video for the popular duo Chage and Aska titled “On Your Mark” (watch it below). The MV was shown that year as an opening to the duo’s concert, as well as in theaters, before the showing of their feature film Whisper of the Heart. Running for about 6.5 minutes without any dialogue, the short film depicts a post-apocalyptic city in which radiation and disease have forced the population to seek life underground. In an interview in Animage magazine (August 1995 Vol. 206) Miyazaki talks about his short film and the images of nuclear contamination, freedom and revolt that, in the light of a real nuclear disaster in Fukushima, reads as an eerie prophecy. the “police officer” and the “angel” – it reminds me a lot of the work of Mamoru Oshii  : Oshii would keep us hanging on whether an angel would be born or not, so I went ahead and created one (laughing). But with that said, no one ever stated it was an angel. It could be a bird person. But that’s beside the point. It felt like an entire movie stuffed into just 6 min. 40 sec.  I did fill it with a with cryptic symbolism. But it is a music video so I don’t mind if the viewer interprets it however they choose. What is that grotesque structure we see towering over the peaceful countryside in the opening?  It’s open to interpretation. But I would hope that the truck with the radiation warning symbol on it that appears in the following scene would provide a hint. It sets the stage for a world that has become overrun by radiation and no longer livable. And yet nature lives on – much like the surrounding areas of chernobyl after the incident. It’s become a natural sanctuary where people are forced to pursue life underground. However, in reality people would likely accept disease and continue to live above ground. Tell us a little about “On Your Mark” as a music video.  The title means (on your mark)  and it’s based on an intentional distortion of the lyrics. It’s set in a post-apocolyptic world where radiation is teeming and disease is rampant. I actually believe a time like this will someday come and I made this film imagining what it would be like to live through such a time. I would imagine widespread anarchy but also an increase in conservatism and a crackdown on criticism towards the establishment. But that’s because they believe there is still something to lose. Once you have nothing to lose is when the anarchy sets in and people begin dropping like flies. As a counterbalance we have things like drugs, professional sports and religion to help create an illusion, right? So naturally those experience a surge. Thinking about a time like that, this song itself becomes a cryptic message that hides its true meaning from the establishment. The film has a very dark side (laughing). One of the lyrics, for example, is “wherever I go the latest cold gets me.” Is “the latest cold” code for a world enveloped with radiation or disease?  (without affirming or denying) if you look at our planet’s history, all of mankind’s problems are nothing more than the common cold. To me the 2 officers who rescue the angel appear to be a thread of hope in this chaotic world. The lyrics, “and yet we refuse to give up…,” seem to be consistent with the repetition of the scene in which they rescue the angel. After many failures the last thread of hope rescues the girl, who flies to blue skies leaving the officers behind…  The girls is not a savior. And the act of rescuing her does not become some sort of channel for communion. If you have hope, or something that you hold on to dearly, but then are faced with circumstances in which you must let it go, you unclasp your hand and let it go into a place where no one else will ever find it. That is all. When the officer lets go, perhaps for a split second there is some form of communication that takes place. And that’s fine. I suppose the two will return to the jobs as police officers. Although I don’t know if they will be able to (laughing). And the world they return to is the world enveloped in “the latest cold.”  In the end, everything must start from there. Even in chaotic times, good things happen, or things that make your heart beat faster.

But when globally-acclaimed Japanese design studio Nendo are brought in to design a retrospective celebrating the 70-year career of Akio Hirata , one of Japan’s foremost avant-garde hat designers, sparks – or better yet, hats – are sure to fly.  Born in 1925, Hirata immersed himself in hat design at the tender age of 14. In 1962 he travelled to Paris to serve as apprentice to Jean Barthet, one of France’s most prominent milliners with a clientele that included Grace Kelly and Sophia Loren. Upon returning to Japan he established Haute Mode Hirata , and went on to design hats for the likes of Issey Miyake, Comme des Garçons and Yohji Yamamoto. In response to a request from Rei Kawakubo (Comme des Garçons) to design a hat that looks like “it had been left unused in someone’s dresser,” Hirata once famously created a hat adorned with crushed flowers. Much in the same way that Hirata was known for grabbing the creative reins, Nendo, in an unexpected turn of events, decided to flood the gallery space with roughly 4000 “ghost hats” that define the flow of activity. But more importantly, they serves as an antithesis to the roughly 130 original Hirata hats – both new and old – that span the designer’s career. Rather than drowning out Hirata’s work, the calculated move serves as a point of contrast, differentiating the fine craftsmanship and artistic sensibility that has defined Hirata as an artist. The show takes place at Spiral , a multi-purpose cultural center that was included in our Tokyo Design Guide . If you thought you missed the exhibition, you’re in luck because it’s been extended. Originally scheduled to close on June 26th, overwhelming popularity prompted organizers to extend the show through this weekend.   ———————————————————- Hirata no Boshi (Hirata’s hats)  Spiral – 1F ( Gmap ) 06.15.2011 – 07.03 11:00 – 20:00 FREE source: twitter | Spiral | Nendo","post_categories":["Fashion","Go and See"],"post_tags":["Akio Hirata","Nendo","Spiral"],"date":"July 1, 2011"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Split Machiya by Atelier Bow Wow","content":" Split Machiya is the latest work by Atelier Bow-Wow — the Tokyo architecture studio led by Yoshiharu Tsukamoto and Momoyo Kajima.

Yet for all its seductive charm it remains a society extraordinarily difficult for foreigners to grasp, particularly after its economy fell from the good graces of business analysts back in the early 1990’s. The few Western journalists who haven’t been transferred to China now do little more than pontificate on the causes and implications of the country’s all-too-rarely-challenged “lost decades,” barely able to conceal their schadenfreude. It was no surprise then that after the triple-tragedy of earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdown decimated a chunk of the country’s northeastern coast, foreign journalists swarmed to Japan and began churning out inflammatory and ill-informed coverage that would scarcely pass the muster of a college newspaper editor. Some more well-known and widely ridiculed examples include claims that Tokyo residents were donning face masks to protect against radiation when it was actually just hay fever season, and then of course there was Fox News’ singularly embarrassing inclusion of “Shibuya Eggman Nuclear Power Plant” on a map of the country’s nuclear facilities (Shibuya Eggman is a live music venue located in one of Tokyo’s nightlife districts). Tokyo-based writer and financial analyst Eamonn Fingleton summed up the situation aptly: “It took an earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster to reveal how little the West understands the land of the rising sun.” Amidst the achingly shallow media portrayals of the country’s background, there was one event that struck me as particularly poignant and revealing. In the days following the escalation of the crisis in Fukushima and the mandatory evacuation of everyone residing within a 20-km radius of the stricken power plant, images circulated online of Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) executives visiting evacuees and getting down on their knees to apologize for the disconsolate living conditions forced upon Fukushima residents. The national broadcasting network NHK showed impassioned residents demanding that the TEPCO executives dogeza, or get down on their knees and bow their heads deeply to the ground. They complied wordlessly and a tad reluctantly amidst a storm of camera shutters that punctuated the crowd’s anger. The Japan represented in that scene is the Japan that I have come to know through a life-long love/hate relationship; a society of odd juxtapositions that somehow manages to both confirm and repudiate popular stereotypes. In the eyes of many foreign observers, Japan is a nation governed by respect, honor, and rigid traditional values that leave little room for individual expression. But in that room in Fukushima, evacuees cast off any and all tendencies toward courtesy and decorum and displayed a level of outrage that, while certainly justified, was nonetheless jarring for its naked intensity. The response to this uninhibited verbal abuse was a physical gesture meant to show extreme reverence or remorse, with courtly historical roots that stretch back over a thousand years. Vibrant contradictions such as this are not just exceptions birthed by adverse circumstances- they abound in Japanese culture: borderline-preposterous TV comedy/variety shows share studios with some of the most stone-faced newscasters on earth; traditional cuisine emphasizing harmony with nature coexists with hugely successful global fast-food franchises; and tremendously popular boy/girl bands (which seem to get progressively larger and younger with time) evolved alongside punk, jazz, avant-garde, and experimental music scenes. The Japanese are stoic but also silly, subdued but also passionate, hard-working but also lackadaisical, traditional but also forward-thinking (those of you who’ve lived in Japan, feel free to insert your own here). During a series of lectures on the limitations of human perception, William James offered the following maxim for making sense of external phenomena: “The meanings are there for the others, but they are not there for us.” In the case of Japan as in many others, a part of me believes the meanings could be there for us if only we shed the monochromatic lenses obscuring our views. Unfortunately, this ideal is nothing more than a fitful dream, transient and replete with potentially dangerous ramifications. The idea that we enter this world and pass into the next partially blinded the entire way is inescapably fatalistic, but equally inescapable is the arrogance in presuming otherwise. Perhaps ultimately the best we can strive for is not increased understanding, but rather a sensitivity guided by increased awareness of our own ignorance.","post_categories":["notes from the editors"],"post_tags":[],"date":"June 16, 2011"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"A Study in Boyoyong by Jun Aoki and Mongoose Studio","content":" Next month, in an exhibition titled “A Study in Boyoyong,” architect Jun Aoki and design collective Mongoose Studio will present an installation that aims to study the intangible qualities of what can be compared to the recoiling motion of certain softshell objects.

Tezuka Architects recently completed a new addition to Fuji Yochien , a private preschool located in the western suburbs of Tokyo, which they designed back in 2007. Ring Around a Tree (2011), which was built as a designated learning center for English language classes, appears as a structure that winds itself around one of the large Keyaki trees on campus. It was given that name by architect Peter Cook , who visited the site and was reminded of the song, “Ring Around a Rosy.”     Ring Around a Tree was designed to complement the donut-shaped main building , who’s form allows it to be inherently contiguous. One of the primary objectives, says art director Kashiwa Sato , is to nurture an abounding creativity. While acting as the walls to a classroom, the structure, at its core, is a one gigantic jungle gym. Children are encouraged to come up with their own rules without being hampered by traditional styles of learning. It’s architecture that facilitates development and learning through play.   One of the things I find most fascinating about this structure is that, despite being built around a tree, in no way does it overshadow the tree. In fact, its transparency only enhances the overwhelming force of nature that emanates from the tree. source: Tezuka Architects website | Fuji Yochien (thanks to everyone involved for responding to my request for images)","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["architecture-educational","architecture-in-the-forest","architecture-outdoors-in","Kids","Tezuka Architects"],"date":"June 24, 2011"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Sou Fujimoto’s proposal for the Beton Hala Waterfront Center in Serbia","content":" It was announced the other day that Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto has tied for 1st place in a competition to design the Beton Hala Waterfront Center in Belgrade, Serbia.

Here is a gallery where you will find all the proposals . Personally I would love to see Fujimoto’s cloud-like structure erected but given the audacity and ambitiousness of his designs (not to mention home-court advantage working against him) it’s probably unlikely. Fujimoto’s concept is all about leveraging the natural elements of the site. The structure is comprised of seven strips of spiral ramps, supporting columns and cores. Water pipes will be mounted on all the handrails and the water will be warmed by solar radiation as it runs down the pipes. In turn, cold water from the river will be used to cool the internal mechanisms of the structure. Thermal mass will be implemented as a heat source for the gallery, which is situated underground. Fujimoto believes that he can obtain a highly efficient equilibrium between the ground temperature and the water temperature surrounding the site.

Running in parallel with the 54th Venice Biennale , the event invites globally acclaimed designers and architects to express their ideas through the medium of glass. Yoshioka will be presenting Kou-An (光庵), a transparent tea house made from glass . What struck me as significant was not that Yoshioka, who has amassed a great deal of influence, was presenting a tea house, but the continued succession of designers, both large and small, driven by either commission or self-will, jumping at the opportunity to design a tea house. In a chain of events that eventually broke the camel’s back, it begged the oh-so-obvious question, what is up with Japanese designers and tea houses? With low expectations of finding an answer I’d like to take a look at some tea houses designed over the past 10 years, while discussing the history of the tea house and its relationship with architecture. The relationship between tea ceremonies, or , and the tea house is akin to that of art and the museum. Although they are certainly not mutually exclusive, in many settings the tea house plays an important role in heightening the significance of the former. The tea ceremony originally began in the late Kamakura period (1185–1333) and, for a couple hundred years, took on various roles ranging from the highly spiritual to the obscenely vulgar. It was a narcissistic and indulgent form of tea that produced a strong response from a few . Small and secluded huts began to appear in the outskirts of urban centers with a primary intent not of abandonment, but what we would describe almost as a summer retreat. The ruinous huts offered an escape from the everyday bustle and provided individuals with the means to seek out a different perspective. These , or hermitages, where the first form of the tea house. Shigeru Ban’s Paper Tea House was part of a charity sale of Japanese art and design (sponsored by Phillips de Pury & Company ) in order to raise money for the refugees of the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami . One of Japan’s most well-known architects, Shigeru Ban has been designing paper tube structures since 1989 with a portfolio that includes multiple refugee housing solutions for disaster zones in places such as Rwanda and Turkey, a temporary office that sits on the roof of the Pompidou Centre in Paris and a paper concert hall in L’aquila, ITALY. The Low-tech, adaptable and recyclable qualities of the structures are consistent with Ban’s ethical and environmental footing.   Led by powerful lords who had gained control by being victorious in many small wars, the simplistic and ruinous iori hut soon morphed into a symbol of wealth and power. Expensive karamono, or Chinese ceramics, began to be incorporated into the design of tea houses, along with various other intricate displays such as the use of expensive wood and washi paper for the structure, latticework on the windows, and the application of lacquer to utensils and other elements. But during the early-to-mid- Muromachi period (1336 – 1573) a significant change took place, which shifted the direction of the tea house. Although it was led by several, for simplicity’s sake we will focus on Sen no Rikyu , who is often credited with sculpting the tea ceremony as we know it today, and whose name is synonymous with the Japanese aesthetic. Rikyu preceded to, one by one, strip strip each aforementioned trait, distilling the tea house down to his ideal space: the rustic tea house, or soan. In 2008, Eyes-Japan , a company who prides itself in its fusion of traditional and modern, announced that they had created Hako-ie . Literally, box house, the structure is meant to serve as a temporary tea house within its larger dwelling. Hako-ie is a sealed off space that filters out and mutes activity in the rest of the home. It acts as a miniature man-made universe. Being eminently erasable in nature, the structure boasts easy assembly and disassembly without the need for a single screw or nail. That year it was awarded a Good Design Award . You start out with something like this…  bypass a few steps…  and voila!  But Sen no Rikyu didn’t stop with his trimmed down soan tea house. As tea master for Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1537 – 1598), the most powerful man in Japan at the time, Rikyu responded to that power by constructing Tai-an (待庵), his most extreme tea house ever. It’s entrance was so small that participants had to remove their sword (a symbol of rank) and crawl inside. The interior was anything but glamorous. In fact, it resembled a tiny cave more than anything else. It was the first time that a had been used for such a powerful figure. The result was a 2-tatami mat space, just enough room for Rikyu and his master, the most powerful man in Japan, to conduct an intimate tea ceremony . Kengo Kuma has created several unorthodox tea houses. But in 2007 he created Fuan (浮庵) (floating hermitage), a floating tea room comprised of a helium balloon veiled with an ultra-light fabric. Weighing in at a mere 11 grams per square meter, the weight of the material counteracts the upward pressure of the helium, creating a perfectly balanced structure without walls or pillars. Kuma occasionally exhibits his floating tea house (usually in locations of chaotic activity, such as department store), inviting spectators to join a real tea ceremony in a seemingly paradoxical space of virtual reality. The structure, if one can call it that, mirrors Kuma’s distaste for overly-assertive architecture, instead favoring “soft architecture,” a term coined by Kuma that refers to the temporary, almost erasable, characteristics of the discipline that he is drawn to. I can only imagine, but Fuan must offer quite a different perspective on the world as it looks into itself and away from its surrounding environment.  Rikyu’s death caused yet another upheaval in tea house architecture. Primarily led by his many disciples who, perhaps freed from the monumental and regal authority that Rikyu represented, branched out into different experimental directions. The students built upon and expanded upon their master’s heritage. Although Rikyu’s blood descendants emulated his style and continued to experiment with ultra-small tea houses, as a whole, post-Rikyu tea rooms tended to be brighter and larger. In 2006 Hokkaido-based architect Jun Igarashi constructed “ Tea House .” The half-submerged structure is unique in that, amongst other obvious traits, it uses elevation as a means of separating the tea preparation area from the serving area. Paradoxically, the tea preparation area is small, dark and intimate but as the tea is moved to be served the space intrinsically unfolds, allowing for the infinitely vast environment to enter into the ceremony. It’s also worth noting that, visually, the structure is quite ironic. A motif of a home was used to create the concrete structure while the rust-colored roof doubles as a table.   After Rikyu’s death the tea house, architecturally and academically speaking, entered a period of prolonged neglect. Almost all through the Edo period (1603 – 1868) the tea rooms being built were copies and imitations of what Rikyu had done. Even Japan’s first native architects largely ignored the tea house as a legitimate form of architecture. In the 1920s Japan saw the emergence of several architects who had been deeply influence by European modernism. These architects ignited a brief interest in the tea house but it was short-lived and the dry spell was once again upon us. Kenzo Tange (1913 – 2005), Japan’s leading postwar architect, once said with a hubris that can almost sound naïve, “I don’t do homes.” It was a reflection on his belief that an architect can only shine through monumental, large-scale public works (I don’t even want to know how he feels about the intimate, miniscule tea house.) By and large his position was shared by most post-war architects, and the tea house was dismissed as irrelevant. Terunobu Fujimori is perhaps one of the more academic architects working in Japan today, both conceptually and in practice. He has been deeply influenced by the tea house, which makes him a perfect subject as we wind down our discussion. In 2004 Fujimori completed a tea house titled Takasugi-an (高過庵), literally “too tall hermitage.” Firmly footed in the teachings of Rikyu, the interior is anything but spacious and is composed of humble materials like plaster and bamboo mats. Although Rikyu preferred the even smaller 2-mat space for floor area, Fujimori went with the iconic yojohan (4.5 tatami mats); just enough space for 2 guests to sit (but not stand!) Here is where, visually, the similarities cease and Fujimori’s tea house diverges from tradition. The house was erected upon 2 trees that were cut and brought in from a nearby mountain. In order to reach the room, guests must climb up the freestanding ladders propped up against the tree. And therein lies the genius of Fujimori’s work. Using paradox to guide the consciousness of his guests, he takes them from an exhilarating climb to a serene and spiritual setting high above ground.  Beginning with the small iori hut and following it’s rise-fall-rise-fall roller coaster ride that is the history of the tea house, we now arrive in contemporary Japan where, for roughly 20 years now, the tea house has flourished as an architectural subject. Current-day homes incorporate tea houses in order to provide a physical separation between noise and tranquility, the everyday and the spiritual. The tea room can be stand-alone or connected to a home. But as we have seen, there are various rules that determine its shape and form. And much akin to the way western architects approach a bathroom or kitchen, tea houses are typically built using the best of materials. In terms of $ per Sq ft, the tea house is probably about 10 times the cost of other parts of the home. I think it’s pretty clear that its historical context, combined with the many constraints that accompany the tea house, make it an attractive subject for architects. My designer friends have told me that they like the challenge of making something artistically beautiful that also has to perform a task. In fact, psychologists have argued that, when forced to come up with something under extreme constraints, we rely on different, often subconscious, parts of the brain. When considering modern-day Japan, in all its denseness and proximity between homes and lack of privacy, I can’t help but recall the original intent of the tea house. Roughly 800 years ago tiny huts appeared in urban centers that looked away from the city and into itself. In essence, the tea house symbolized a piece of non-urban architecture within an urban setting. And at the same time, with all its tiny entrances, rustic ruin, ironic lack of accoutrements and paradoxical spaces that somehow balance large and small, interior and exterior, the tea house appears to contradict the very foundation that architecture was built upon. In fact, Terunobu Fujimori (Takasugi-an) has argued that, as a form of architecture, the Japanese tea house is the only arena in which paradox, irony and ruin come together in a single subject. I’m no architect and so I’ll never really know, but I suspect that the tea house, in many shapes and forms, emulates the modern Japanese home (or perhaps it’s the other way around). The tea room, so small and intimate, represents a balance that architects strive to achieve in every residence they design. It’s through the tea house that they hone their artistic skill and flex their creative muscle. The tea house allows architects to flirt with the surreal in ways they will never be able to in traditional practice. The Contemporary Tea House by Arata Isozaki et. al.

On April 3, 2011 the House was sold for £31,700, slightly above pre-sale estimates of £20,000 – 30,000. It’s worth noting here that due to an argument stemming from difference in opinion (exact reasons remain unclear) in 1591 Hideyoshi ordered Rikyu to commit ritual suicide.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["Japanese architecture","Jun Igarashi","Shigeru Ban","tea","Terunobu Fujimori","Tokujin Yoshioka"],"date":"June 8, 2011"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Rokko Shidare by Hiroshi Sambuichi","content":"New York’s sudden heat wave has given us all a bitter taste of what’s in store in the coming weeks.

For fans of the comic it’s been an excruciating 18 months since the last volume was released, and an equally excruciating 10 years – the time it’s taken Togashi to produce a mere 10 volumes. To put things in perspective, compare it to ONE PIECE , the equally epic tale of pirates. The 2 began around the same time (late 90s) but ONE PIECE has trumped HUNTER x HUNTER in quantity, producing 62 volumes at a rate of roughly 4 per year. But that’s actually what one would expect from a hit comic. What’s astounding, and perhaps exemplary of his status in the industry, is that Togashi has managed to get by, both from his editors and his fans, at such a grinding rate, while keeping them both on board. In fact, message board will indicate that his behavior, interpreted as a mix of laziness, narcissism and a keen susceptibility to “personal issues,” has, at worst, only aggravated fans. (The author has recently attributed his hiatuses to a new addition to the family 2 years ago. But it doesn’t make up for the past 10 years.) In my mind Togashi’s behavior was driven by conceit, combined with his need, or lack thereof, for additional income. his previous hit, YuYu Hakusho (another one of my childhood favorites) not only established him as one of the great comic book writers at the time, but it’s likely that it also continues to generate enough cash for him to live comfortably with having to worry about meeting deadlines. The euphoria around volume 28 was only compounded by the announcement that an additional volume (29) would be consecutively released the following month in August. Two volumes in two months is unheard of for Togashi! However, fans including myself are not getting their hopes up. A sudden sprint could very well be the foreshadowing of another long dry-spell. Unless of course the ideal scenario occurred, which would be that Togashi puts an end to his enticing story in the next 2 volumes, thereby putting me out of my misery.  So this is what the actual cover of volume 28 looks like.","post_categories":["notes from the editors"],"post_tags":["HUNTER x HUNTER"],"date":"June 13, 2011"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"OpenJapan: the results","content":"Last Friday OpenSimSim’s 72-hour crowd-sourced work-sprint kicked off and continued rolling all through the weekend.

Kawauchi is well-known for her ability to illuminate the every-day, transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary. The show, “ Colloquy and Soliloquy ,” which opens today at mountain fold gallery, represents a thematic divergence from the artists’ comfort zone. It will be interesting to see how Kawauchi interprets this very unordinary event.   Kawauchi will be presenting her work alongside artist Taewon Jang. Sales from this show will be donated to the non-governmental organization Peace Winds Japan . Coincidentally, Kawauchi is currently showcasing another body of work in New York. “Illuminance,” on display at Gallery Hermès through June 16th, provides the content for a new book of the same name.    Kawauchi first captured the spotlight in 2001 with her simultaneous release of 3 photo books – UTATANE, HANABI and HANAKO. I’ve heard her say that she derives her style from having the eyes and ears of a child. Despite living in crowded Tokyo, or perhaps the result of that very environment, Kawauchi finds herself transfixed by the small things – a patch of flowers or a snail on a rainy day. But her exquisite style should not be carelessly mistaken for insignificance. It’s the way she experiences the world around her that is of the utmost significance to us as the viewer. ———————————————– Colloquy and Soliloquy  Mountain fold gallery (55 Fifth Avenue, 18th Floor) Rinko Kawauchi and Taewon Jang 05.24.2011 – 06.28 Illuminance Gallery at Hermès (691 Madison Avenue) 05.20.2011 – 06.16 source: tmagazine | mountain fold | my friend masako","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["2011 earthquake","Rinko Kawauchi"],"date":"May 24, 2011"},{"author":"Maddie","title":"Johnny featured on The Inside Source","content":" Spoon & Tamago ‘s very own Johnny Strategy was featured yesterday on The Inside Source, eBay ‘s digital style magazine.

For her latest project, Sejima has designed a community workshop space in the Shibaura district of Tokyo.

Shibaura House , the 7-story, largely translucent structure, will attempt to position itself as a hub for the next step of creative dialogue. Slated to open in July of 2011, Shibaura House will have a rotating roster of speakers, as well as various events, all spanning the genres of business and social issues to art, design and lifestyle. The project was commissioned by Kohkoku Seihan, a printing/publishing services company who has also been operating a series of workshops for kids.

The ground floor serves as café where visitors can order drinks and deserts. On the 2nd floor is a library where you can spend an unlimited amount of time reading or just relaxing.

Aptly titled “Nest,” the home – in its interconnectedness and open layout – projects a maternal presence upon its inhabitants, whom happen to be 3 very close women; a mother and her two daughters. The structure, completed late last year, consists of a small entrance on the ground, that expands outward into the forest.

One of those is Jun Igarashi , 1 of 8 architects we featured in our Japanese Contemporary Architects piece back in 2008. He has come a long way since then, as evidenced by an upcoming retrospective that will be held at Toto’s Gallery MA in Tokyo between May 13 – July 9. The construction of a state (as in the condition, not the territory) is his first ever solo exhibition since he established his own studio 15 years ago and will feature 18 of his defining pieces of work. Below is a sample of some pieces that will be included in the show.  Igarashi reimagined the traditional art form that is cha-no-yu to create this submerged tea house. The rust-colored roof on top of the untreated concrete doubles as a table.   Located on a tiny plot of land, the site-specific home can be characterized by an introversion that can only be justified by its Hokkaido location.

Takayuki Hori’s work (things folded and connected) was awarded 1st prize. Hori embeds the ancient craft of origami with an environmental theme by using the skeleton of a sea turtle, waterfowl and 6 other endangered animals printed on a translucent material. The material is then folded into the shape of the animal. The stark and eerily poignant origami prints reminds us that, much like the way the craft has been passed down from generation to generation, these animals that have accompanied us for thousands of years now face extinction.

Floral artist Makoto Azuma has been challenging our relationship with plants for quite some time now. It’s not a commonly discussed topic, especially amongst floral designers who make their living by often ending the life of plants in order to make a pretty display.  But Azuma, whether he is creating an installation of flowers to be stomped on during a performance, or removing an age-old bonsai from its soil and hanging it in mid-air , approaches the subject matter head on. In his latest series , which he has been releasing over the last few days, Azuma creates bold yet somewhat disturbing pieces comprised of flowers stuffed into glass bottles like sardines and then filled with water. The flowers, which are shockingly beautiful but also clearly dead, invoke images of laboratory experiments in which body parts are preserved in some sort of embalming fluid.

With strong anti-nuclear and anti-government lyrics the singer even goes as far as to use the actual names of some of the utilities who have increasingly become the target of public anger. Partial lyrics translated by Spoon & Tamago: My personal take on this is that I understand that the artist is angry and this is his reaction to a series of disastrous, terrible and tragic events. However – and I’ve expressed this on twitter ( here and here ) – I feel there are more constructive things we can do rather than blame the utilities and make reactive claims like banning nuclear energy. Every time there is a disaster or accident such as this one there are groups who jump to extreme conclusions. To denounce nuclear power is to denounce a lifestyle that all of us have actively participated in and benefited from. It’s a good song. I’ll give you that.

Although a full seven days have gone by since the Sendai earthquake struck Japan, I still am not able to articulate the feeling of watching the country I grew up in, the country I love and admire, the country that is home to a landscape of memories, bleed. In fact, I am having a lot of trouble just writing this. I’m not going to bore you with my life story, but to quickly summarize, I moved from Brooklyn to Japan in 1982 when I was one. My parents and I settled down in the quaint town of Koenji which, at the time, was home to roughly zero foreigners (I’m exaggerating but the number was minuscule). Koenji welcomed us in like family and thus began my simultaneous dual-absorption of cultures – Japanese amongst my friends at school and in the neighborhood and American at home. Japan nurtured me until, 18 years later, I was ready to venture out of my bubble to the States to attend college. I owe so much of who I am to Japan…which is odd for me to even write because it’s so obvious I don’t give it much thought. Japan is not my second home. It is my home. And it’s bleeding. What we’ve been doing here at Spoon & Tamago is, continuing to do what we do best. We’ve been shying away from all the sensational news stories out there, which, as predictable as they are, lead to a dangerous divergence in perception of the situation. Instead, all week long we’ve been writing about artists and designers who are doing their part to cope with the situation, make sense of the confusion and attempting to remedy what they can. You can read all our posts on the earthquake by following the tag . I realize that some of my posts may have alienated non-Japanese speakers, which, although I try not to do, was unavoidable. While my thoughts are with the citizens during this painful and difficult time, I’m inspired by the courage and resilience being displayed. My hope is that still more are rescued from the rubble and that aid reaches those in desperate need. And I will continue to hope for life to return to normal as soon as possible. I don’t want this to sound like a conclusion, because that’s not what it is. Right now, as I write this, there are refugees who are freezing cold, trying to survive on what meager supplies are left. Some will not make it. Parents still suffer from the pain of losing children who were on their way home from school – a pain that thrusts my nails into my skin just trying to imagine what it might be like. Those in the field continue to deal with this nightmare 24 hours a day. And yet, for me, as I replay the videos on youtube and gaze in utter disbelief at the slideshows, there is an overarching lesson that I will hopefully carry with me for years and years to come.

Her medium of choice is the bikini, which she has just used to raise over 500,000 yen with 100% of proceeds going directly to victims of the earthquake. Project “bikini de nihon wo genki ni” was an auction that began last Thursday at 100 yen and culminated in a bidding war in which it took over an hour for the last 15 minutes to come to an end (an automated extension program adds time to the clock whenever new bid is entered within the last 5 minutes, or something like that). The price inflated to 530,000 yen (about $6500) with over 170 bidders participating in the action. I tweeted about the auction last week when it was first announced and, with the risk portraying myself as a perv, I’m reposting the story here because I think it’s an excellent example of how unexpected aid is rolling in from unexpected people.

He had enlisted Manaka to take a portrait of himself but, unsatisfied with the results of a conventional portrait, the two decided to take clippings from an old movie poster and collage it onto the face.  Looking at this work Nakazawa recalled Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali’s 16-minute dreamlike film Un Chien Andalou . Nakazawa confided in Manaka and the two, inspired by what the human psyche could create, began NAM . The naming is simply derived from the initials of the two founders. It’s a nice story but it’s also crucial in understanding the body of work that ensued over the next 4 years. Perhaps the most striking characteristic of their work is the visual effects, or lack thereof; they employ none. Each scene is meticulously constructed using lots of strings, conventional photography and other old-school (and low-budget) techniques.

She began publicly documenting her work in 2009, which began with mundane shots of food and her two cats. In 2010 the photo-diary took an unexpected turn, morphing into a showcase of a series titled “today’s levitation” where, intermingled with photos of her cats (not levitating), she would post photos of herself frozen in mid-air.  From a technical perspective, it’s impressive how still some of the photos appear. It’s hard to imagine that a strong force of energy was exerted in order to boost her into the air. Perhaps what’s so fascinating about the images is the absence of energy and a moment, quite literally, frozen. Another reason I am drawn to some of the images is that, while entirely playful in nature, there is a subversive, somewhat rebellious underlying theme. In a society that quietly enforces conformity, a person who takes pictures while publicly jumping in the air is bound to stick out. And her attraction to locations where such acts would be frowned upon or considered dangerous – train platforms and elevated crossings – only help to stir up apprehension.   via violence visual","post_categories":["Art"],"post_tags":["Natsumi Hayashi","Photography"],"date":"February 15, 2011"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"New work by Nakano Design Office","content":"On more than one occasion we’ve turned to the work of Takeo Nakano, of Nakano Design Office , for graphic design inspiration.

The neck camera, which was co-developed with the University, is a working model. You drape the camera strap around your neck and images are recorded by the simple act of creating a picture frame using your hands like this  . Not only is it a beautiful looking product, it poses some interesting questions about our relationship with photography, as well as gadgets, for that matter. In his seminal essay on photography , John Berger writes: Although we don’t always look at a photograph and think, “ah, human choice,” Takuya Motte’s neck camera has the potential for making us far more aware of our actions as photographers. Not only will we be more conscious of the act of recording, but we will take pleasure in the process, our surroundings and our current conditions far more than we ever have. It’s interface is also worth considering as it is a significant step forward in blurring the lines between human and mechanic relations. What was once a very mechanical process can now be accomplished through a very natural human gesture.

The not-so-common solution came from an unexpected object: a box.  To be clear, not just any box. Upon considering the functionality of closed boxes the architect was inspired by box-like rooms, such as bathrooms, bedrooms and closets, that are intended to close. When those boxes accumulate, certain creases, or gills, of various length and width emerge between the boxes creating an illusion of depth.  This very interesting banister, which reminds me of a circuit board, gets high marks for ingenuity but low marks for kid-friendliness. The structure of the home itself comes from the very simple guideline of using the box for rooms that must close, and the space between the boxes for rooms that don’t need to close.

Here are our most popular posts of 2010: Hideyuki Nakayama’s interior-reflecting doorknob captured the hearts of everyone (including a few serial killers and pervs). Shin Okada’s hinoki humidifier seems to be the perfect solution for cold, dry winters. There is a lot of up-and-coming talent, as evidenced by the amazing work showcased by the students of Kyoto University Art and Design. Professionals, beware.

The primary method applied, in order to  take full advantage of the given land area, was that of manipulating various floor levels and walls to create a space where furniture and architecture meet, and do a little dance together. In fact, in describing it one runs the risk of coining the word, furnitecture.   For example, the 2nd floor landing not only extends into a bedroom, but it also serves as a work desk.

Their latest project, completed in September 2010 is , or Riverbank House.  Located on a narrow strip of land, sandwiched between a quiet riverbank and a residential neighborhood, the home’s unique form was inspired by the juxtaposed views offered by the surrounding environment. Standing on the riverbank you had views of the calm stream traveling to an unknown destination, unfazed by the birds, joggers and other small life form taking advantage of its natural serenity. However, a few steps down the bank, away from the river, revealed a startlingly contrasting view; homes and more homes, so grounded and monumental. The completed home is a perfect isosceles triangle which, by definition, consists of 2 even sides. However, as the photos accurately portray, there is nothing even about them. One side of the triangle – the side facing the neighboring houses – does not have a single window, opening or slit except for the door. Because there was no need. The opposite side could not be more revealing. Each room is accompanied by large windows that open up to the environment around it. The living room and dining room, places where one might entertain guests, are located on the second floor. The private quarters are located on the ground level. Each side of the home, with its minimal, smooth surface on one side and its relatively complex set of shapes and openings on the other, are like a reflection of each opposing environment – the residential neighborhood and the serene stream. The home is a true meditation on site-specific architecture and how one comes to terms with the immovable.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["architecture-residential","mA-style"],"date":"November 23, 2010"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Meisa Kuroki, among others, recipient of gorgeous paper trophy","content":" Meisa Kuroki accepts her trophy | image © Haruka Nakagawa Yesterday Vogue Nippon held it’s annual Women of the Year ceremony at the Grand Hyatt Hotel.

I have a weakness for all things Totoro . Here is another project by mA-style , completed in early 2010. If we learned anything about the way they work from their Riverbank House , it was that the architects – Atsushi and Mayumi Kawamoto – are often inspired by the local ecosystem and all the particular elements that come together to form it.  Upon inspection of the site and its surroundings in Shizuoka prefecture , the architects were intrigued by the nostalgia of the small village, which lay at the bottom of a ravine. On top of a hill was a peculiarly large tree, gently overlooking the houses. Firmly planted amongst the roots of the tree was an old Shinto shrine. (Whoever has seen should have a picturesque image in their minds by now.)  The architects were inspired by the regal self assurance of the village, knowing that she is held securely in the palm of her surroundings.   Within that context, the value of simply designing convenience and functionality to be subsequently inserted into society was brought into question. Instead of creating an environment draped in seclusion the architects felt the need to allow the region’s climate, or way of being, to enter freely into the design. It was living, without limitations. It was habitat that, at its core, could be felt, touched and enjoyed. (PS It’s probably the way the photos were taken, but doesn’t this home look like a dollhouse?)

Time to look back on Japan’s best products of 2010 according to ad agency Dentsu. As it was last year, the selection is based on 4 major categories, sales, ingenuity, market-creation and influence. Making a huge leap from 34th place last year into 1st place were smartphones. Apple’s iPhone 4, which was released in mid-2010, was the primary contender in this category. But Android-based smartphones like Xperia also kept pace. During 2010, Twitter surpassed Mixi in Japan, becoming the country’s most widely-used social networking service. Previously a niche product whose sole usage was a condiment used in gyoza sauce, Rayu was reincarnated into a spoonable consistency by Momoya, who released  “ It looks spicy but isn’t too spicy but is a bit spicy ” in 2009. The real excitement happened in March of 2010 when SB Foods released a copycat product called “ Pour it on! Main dish rayu, a bit spicy .” Edible rayu went viral, selling out in supermarkets across the country. When Japan announced they were switching over to digital television and eliminating all analog service, Japan’s tech-saavy consumers took the only reasonable next step: going out and buying the biggest, thinnest digital TV they could find. (Actually, all you needed was a tuner that costs about 8,000 yen.) Sakamoto Ryoma was a leader of the movement to overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate during the Bakumatsu period (1852-1869). But I’m sure he never would have guessed that 150 years later he would become the central figure of NHK’s year-long historical fiction television series “ Ryomaden ,” igniting Sakamoto Ryoma fever across Japan. Companies were quick to try and capitalize on the historic figure’s new-found fame launching products such as Sakamoto Ryoma beer and coffee . A third terminal for international flights was completed in October 2010. Designed to be the new tower for terrestrial digital broadcasting throughout greater Tokyo (see #4), and replacing the venerable Tokyo Tower, the Sky Tree, when completed in 2012, will become the world’s tallest broadcast tower. It will also have public observation decks and will be lit up every other night with different sets of lights. Announced by the government as part of an economic stimulus package, the Eco-Point system gives consumers points that can be redeemed for a range of goods when they purchase eco-friendly appliances. Originally announced in mid-2009, the program was extended through the end of 2010. The program was well-received and helped provide a boost to several industries including the LED lighting industry (see#10). Held between June and July of 2010 in South Africa, Japan reached the knockout stages of the FIFA World Cup, drawing worldwide praise and attention.

It’s warm, wooden and structurally stimulating. It’s located in Hokkaido, the “snow country” of Japan, which is interesting because I always thought open-layouts and cold climates were mutually exclusive.  It turns out that the floor plan is a solution proposed by the architects in order to respond to their clients request for an outdoor-like environment, while still maintaining absolute habitable comfort. The clients  enjoyed being surrounded by other homes, particularly the look and feel of a village. The rather literal – and might I add fantastic – interpretation of this was to create house-shaped rooms, whose roofs could be used as additional space to climb on and sit on.

With a cremation rate of 99.85% (2008 data), Japan and their corpse count, or lack thereof, would seem an ideal place to to ride out a plague of the undead. In the text that follows I would like to analyze the pros and cons of the East vs. the West, so that each of us can make informed decisions regarding our own contingency plans for the impending zombie pandemic. First, when we model out the spread of a zombie pandemic the most essential question is its origination. If the zombie outbreak first originates outside of Japan, and there are no signs of lengthy incubation periods, an initial assessment of the situation may justly lead many to flee to Japan as soon as possible. With very few corpses lying around in the ground, and an ocean surrounding the country, Japan seems to be ideally positioned as a place to not get your brains chewed out. However, in an entirely different scenario, where the outbreak occurs in Japan, one can easily imagine the devastating consequences of being in Japan. In a previous essay , Jim Hawe makes some excellent assertions that question the core of Japan’s safety profile.  First of all, the geographic make-up of Japan could be tragically disadvantageous. Densely populated urban areas serve a ideal feeding ground. And very little land to actually run to, coupled with the likely probability that other countries would deny you entry due to fear of contamination, certainly raises questions about Japan’s zombie outbreak preparedness. The lack of guns and other heavy artillery has served Japan well in maintaing a safe, civil and peaceful society over the years. But, just a equally, this will be a devastating weakness as the unaffected desperately search for means to fend off their attackers. Although popularized as an ideal weapon in the Max Brooks novel “ World War Z ,” in reality any type of samurai sword would prove much more problematic than one might imagine. “Bladed weapons in general are not ideal because they will inevitably get stuck in things and become dull,” said Matt Mogk, founder and head researcher of Zombie Research Society (ZRS).  There is an important component that often gets overlooked when analyzing the fundamental zombie preparedness of Japan. And that is the cultural, and I would argue, genetic, differences between eastern and western zombies. For those who are not familiar, allow me to introduce the kyonshi (殭屍), the Asian zombie. Claiming ancestry in China, the kyonshi (which terrified the sh*t out of me as a child) have several noteworthy characteristics that, I would argue, make them less competitive compared to their Western counterparts.  Currently the only known way to quiet a zombie is to bash their brains in. This is a task that is difficult as it is gruesome, and only slightly easier if aided by a shotgun. However, can be sedated by tactically placing a small scroll with buddhist inscriptions on the forehead (as pictured above). Also, (and this helps in assisting the first objective) are legally blind. They detect human presence from the smell of our breath, making a cornered escape realistically possible by simply holding your breath. are also known to have hardened joints, rendering their arms and legs inflexible. They mobilize their bodies by hopping, extending their arms in front of them to maintain balance. While this can serve as an initial disadvantage, it is worth pointing out that, over time, their joints are known to soften, allowing them to walk and in some cases even run.

About 10 years ago, after an exhaustive search, and the discovery of many standalone calendars and planners – but never 2 in 1 – Bunpei Yorifuji decided to design his own planendar. He drew out a 3-week schedule, overlayed with a progress chart that could accommodate 35 projects and…success! His productivity skyrocketed and schedule conflicts plummeted. Over the past 10 years he has continued to tweak his planendar, adding functionality such as unimposing yet sumptuous margins for notes/doodles and a typeface chart (for Japanese fonts, or course). I think one of the major drawbacks of e-planners are that days, and time, for that matter, become fragmented and one can easily lose track of the flow of day-to-day time. The yPad proposes an elegant solution for this, and also comes with delightful Yorifuji-style illustrations. It’s obviously not for everyone, but for the few who have not embraced e-planners some may still find comfort in an enhanced physical planendar such as Bunpei Yorifuji’s yPad .

Located on the island of Teshima, it’s the latest addition to the Benesse Art Site , which comprises the islands of Naoshima, Teshima and Inujima. Originally planned to coincide with the opening of the 2010 setouchi international arts festival in july, several delays pushed the date back to October. They cut it close, opening the museum with just about 2 weeks left before the arts festival closes. Much in the same spirit of its older sister, the Chichu Art Museum – designed by architect Tadao Ando in 2004 and built into the headland on Naoshima – the Teshima Museum is also nestled into the earth so as not to disturb the natural appearance of the site. Although both museums are intended to merge environment and architecture, there are significant differences in structure and application. The Teshima Museum is made up of a single concrete pod structure with no pillars. The design resembles a droplet of water. And in the same way that rain interacts with the earth, the structure appears to blend and sink into its surrounding hills.  “Matrix” (2010) by Rei Naito With just one (that’s right, 1) work the Teshima Museum easily trumps the Chichu Art Museum’s minimal yet powerful collection of just 9 works. And the structure was designed specifically to house this single work titled “bokei” (母型) – translated as “matrix” – by Rei Naito. The piece, whose title connotes imagery of a motherly figure giving birth to life,  is characterized by moisture from underground water  that seeps up onto the surface. The randomly accumulating droplets of water dance across the floor, as if dictated by their own volition, but actually guided by the wind that enters the structure through 2 oval openings on the ceiling. Everything about the structure, they way it was designed – as an amalgam of art and architecture – to the art that it houses, is meant to illuminate the presence of nature.

The pair embarked on a mission to build upon their success and released “The Garden as Science Fiction Vol 2,” which features vases modeled after plant roots. Once again, utilizing the pair’s favorite medium – porcelain – they attempted to depict our adoration and yearning for nature.  In the same way roots often resemble human organs, the vases have an almost grotesque (in the most beautiful sense) resemblance to organs like the human heart. “Sooner or later we will all live amongst nature,” state the artists. Whether they are insinuating a return to nature after death, or perhaps predicting a world where nature has engulfed all of mankind, there is a fascinating morbidity about seeing roots on the table, serving as a vessel for flowers.

Animation as we know it today would most likely be something completely different if it wasn’t for Tezuka’s immense body of work, which consists of over 400 volumes of graphic novels – known to many as manga – including memorable titles such as Black Jack , Phoenix (Hi no Tori), Kimba the White Lion , and Buddha . I was recently rereading his Sci-Fi classic Tetsuwan Atom (which was translated into Astro Boy, a preferable title compared to its literal equivalent, “Mighty Atom”). Just FYI, but according to Rika Ohara , Tezuka decided to write the story of the nuclear-powered, yet peace-loving, boy robot after being punched in the face by a drunken GI (Japan was still under military occupation). Considering that Astro Boy was written during the early 1950s, a time, in Japan, when the one thing on people’s minds was how to rebuild their country from rubble, Tezuka’s stories were whoppingly visionary. The underlying theme  of the story is the moral dilemma surrounding artificial intelligence, and whether or not robots should be treated as equals. The simple fact that Tezuka was able to imagine robots as part of society 50 years in the future – the setting for Astro Boy – is quite spectacular. And his cityscapes, as seen in the images above, with their tall skyscrapers and elevated train rails, closely resembles the cities of today. But Tezuka’s intoxicating vision of the unfettered possibilities of the future come to a screeching halt when his antagonist picks up the receiver of a black rotary telephone. With a cord. Yes, a cord. That is curly! I threw up in my mouth, just a little bit. So, Mr. Tezuka, how is it possible for someone like you, with incredible foresight, often referred to as “the god of comics,” to not foresee the wireless revolution?

Call me susceptible but ever since I drank Maria Popova ’s Kool-Aid I have been feeling oddly resentful towards design awards. Nonetheless, I am going to push forward but before doing so I want to make something clear for everyone referring to the Good Design Awards as “prestigious.” Unless you are in the top 15, there is nothing prestigious about the award. Last year it was given out to over 1000 designs. You had a 30% chance of getting the award, which seems pretty high to me considering its prestige. Anyway, let’s take a look at some of the top 15 entries. First we have Hibiya Flower Atrium , architect Kumiko Inui ’s remodeling of a flower shop. It certainly is a beautiful store whose open structure helps add a lot of color to its neighborhood.   | go here for more photos I have to mention 9h , the capsule hotel designed by Fumie Shibata et al. because of all the times we have mentioned it on this site. Interestingly, Shibata herself is one of the 70 or so judging committee members.  The sustainable design award went to Takane Heights, a circa 1963 condo that was given a massive facelift by Shigeru Aoki Architects .  I think it’s tremendously important, in an era when we are generating more waste than ever before, that we realize that beautiful architecture can be achieved without tearing down the old and starting from scratch. Before and after picks courtesy of the architect’s blog. And last but certainly not least, as I tweeted several days ago , AKB48, the pop idol unit consisting of 48 underage-looking girls, also placed in the top 15.  Rumors of their placement began swirling several weeks ago and the design community, including myself, passed it off as a joke. But now I’m not really sure what to say about this. Perhaps I need to contemplate it a bit. But maybe  there is more to this group than I first gave them credit for… Related:","post_categories":["Industrial Design"],"post_tags":["design awards","Fumie Shibata","Good Design Awards 2010"],"date":"October 5, 2010"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Senden Kaigi | Promotional Campaign Awards","content":" I thought this proposal for a coca cola ad campaign (PDF) was incredibly cute.

These were the products that would line shelves of Best Buy in 2-3 years. This is no longer the case. Not only does Japan sell the same crap you see anywhere else in the world, innovators like Apple and Dyson have reversed this trend. It makes me wonder what is the next industry to begin losing ground? Film? Anime? I notice more and more foreigners each time I go back, but this time I noticed foreigners working jobs that traditionally were always reserved for Japanese, such as store clerks and waiters/waitresses. I had never seen that before. Undoubtedly, the most significant observation is that the ubiquitous symbol of photography, the peeesu, or peace sign, is on the brink of a coup. The usurper that is threatening to knock it off of its longstanding thrown is none other than the Schwarzenegger thumbs up.

The primary task facing the architects was how to resolve the dilemma of merging environmental lushness with the realities of modern-day farming, which required gravel paths and many (8 to be exact) large industrial vehicles to be parked outside the house.  Their first solution was to visually separate the vehicles from the living environment by creating a primary lawn on top of the roof that housed the vehicles. The living space was then designed around this space. Their second solution was to restore the relationship with nature by integrating well water into the design. Well water gets pumped up to the roof, acting as a cooling mechanism, as well as a sprinkler for the turf on the roof.

In early 2008 the City of Hiroshima asked architects to submit proposals for a competition to design a series of public restrooms in parks throughout the city. They received close to 50 proposals, which they called on the public to judge and select. By mid-2008 the people had spoken. Bunzo Ogawa of Future Studio had beat out Nomura Masafumi Architects with their Absolute Arrows proposal (PDF). You can see Kusari, the runner up proposal, here (PDF). In mid-October of 2009, a total of 5 parks unveiled “Absolute Arrows,” their new public restrooms. ( Google Map ) Three repeatable designs were drawn up in order to adapt to the different sizes of parks. By law, public restrooms cannot encompass more than 2% of a park’s surface area. In March of 2010 an additional 7 restrooms will open. Each year the city will install 5 additional arrow restrooms. In 10 years there will be over 60 of these public restrooms for people to relieve themselves in while contemplating the relationship between space and, well, you know. The concept of the restrooms were to embed the City of Hiroshima with an “absolute axis,” similar to the horizontal and vertical axes of the planet, with all arrows pointing North. The restrooms are equipped with 2 entrances in order to accommodate various orientations. So what does it all mean? To me, it feels like the city is no longer pinned down as a city within Japan, on a map, that was destroyed by nuclear weapons. Instead, it is now part of a grander space and transcends towards a coexistence with the planet. And I suppose those encountering the restrooms have an even greater sense of this. It helps them imagine what is beyond the park fence, or the neighbors wall, or the city’s high-rise buildings.

The new issue of Men’s Non-no, which hits stands on December 10th, looks like it may be setting us up for another year of combat in which we must fight to protect our homeland from those thieving virtualists.

Title: Fresh Label Designer: TO-GENKYO This was a very clever design that tracks a foods expiration date using a universally accepted visual. Over the last year or so Japan had been struck by a number of scandals involving food companies tampering with expiration dates. The new design keeps people honest by changing colors based on the level of ammonia the food emits as it ages.

TRAPEZIUM was designed for a young couple who had 2 requests, a performance hall where their musician friends could perform, and to be able to leave their curtains open without worrying about neighbors peering in. To a certain degree the 2 requests work against each when the objective is to create a welcoming environment where many people are free to come and go, while maintaining a level of privacy. However, I think the architect succeeded immensely in marrying the two. Taguchi also managed to incorporate her own holistic approach to architecture. She believes that the intrinsic value of a home should not be assessed mainly by square footage or the number of bedrooms, but how much sunlight it lets in, or the cross-ventilation, or the view; aspects that ultimately amount to your quality of life within the home.","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":[],"date":"August 14, 2009"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"have a nice weekend!","content":"Sorry that posting has been a little slow.

They’ve produced several notable artists and designers, including Naoto Fukasawa and Issey Miyake, therefore, it’s no mystery why the art community pays a lot of attention to young artists being churned out of this educational system. So today, with the intention of possibly highlighting the next big thing in Japanese design, here are some highlights from apartment , the Information Design BFA show, which was on display last weekend in Harajuku. Some common themes that seemed to permeate the show were self identity, interpersonal relationships, and memory (which ties back into identity). by is an interesting reworking of the personal planner. The online planner allows you to add people who you interact with, placing emphasis on proximity of relationships, and allowing you to adjust how close you are to that person on a scale.  by proposes natto (fermented beans and one of my breakfast time favorites) as  a metaphor for humans. The centerpiece of the installation is a sofa that works off a natto bean motif. A single natto bean amounts to nothing, but when combined – and the stickiness assures they are never separated – makes for a delicious meal of relationships.  by combines the kanji conversion tool with the concept of a thesaurus. The thesaurus contains multiple literary works and when you attempt to convert kana into kanji you get a list of suggested paraphrases from literary sources, instead of a list of kanji. For an English example, if you entered “pride” you may get “the hubristic tendencies of George W. Bush.”  by is pretty straightforward; an investigation into all things snuggly. Compiled into a cleverly designed book, the practice attempts to understand why snuggly things make us feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  by is an interactive installation that I thought made a lot of sense. And keep in mind, EVERYONE rides a bicycle in Japan. In this piece the user must get on the bicycle and peddle, which generates a stream of images from the artist’s past, projected onto the wall in front of them.

I discovered these amazing graphic covers doing research on Japanese graphic design several years ago.  The Shochikuza theater opened in Osaka in 1923. It was the first movie theater dedicated to screening foreign movies, and presented a weekly rotation of imported films from around the world. This was the same year that Tokyo was devastated by an earthquake, and was also known as the inter-war period. Thus the theater quickly became a symbol of modernism and hope, where people from all around gathered to get a glimpse of foreign cultures, which they had been deprived of during the war.  was a pamphlet that was distributed to the moviegoers, highlighting upcoming films and advertisements. The covers, which also changed weekly, were commissioned by young artists, who perhaps accepted the work as a means of making ends meet, but who dreamed of one day becoming famous through their art. Although many signed their names at the bottom of these covers, they are largely indiscernible, and therefore remain anonymous. Graphic design was not very sophisticated at the time, and, as you can see, there is no continuity or standardization of logos or typefaces at all. But perhaps this allowed the budding artists to exercise their creativity. It’s fascinating to observe these posters as an indication of the artistic styles and western concepts that were penetrating Japan at the time.  The theater continued its operations until 1994 when its movie role ended. However, it was restored and currently serves as a Kabuki theater.

The impression I got was that they were new pieces of work, rather than a collection of artifacts from other people’s lives. Perhaps that’s because the act of sewing (as opposed to other means of collage) is very permanent and authoritative.

Currently teaches fundamental design there. -Director of Nippon Design Center -Sits on the advisory board of MUJI (along with Naoto Fukasawa) This is a quote from his book, “ Designing Design ”  I wanted to do a retrospective on Hara Kenya, arguably one of the most influential forces in Japanese contemporary design today. I thought it was particularly timely given the completion of the Beijing Olympics, and all the work Hara has done in regards to China and Chinese culture. Although not chosen, Hara’s work was among the final nominations for symbols and images that were to be used in promotional materials for the Beijing Olympics. Human senses are a central theme to Hara’s work. He believes that sensory overload is beneficial, but differentiates between sensory overload that we receive from our 5 senses and that which we receive from the information highway, dismissing the latter as fragmented and insufficient. For this reason, history also plays an important role for Hara because traditional, and sometimes primitive, methods are key to unlocking our senses. Some of his more recent work, namely the Qianmen Avenue Project, although unrealized at this point, involves the past and present of the historic Qianmen Avenue in China. After a drastic renovation leading up to the Olympics, this location symbolized the struggle between modernization and preservation. I’m going to rewind now and take a look at some of Hara’s earlier work. I love how the embossing gives the appearance of footsteps in snow. Very wintery!  The theme for the first EXPO of the 21st Century was “Nature’s Wisdom.” Hara used the Honzo Zusetsu, a collection of natural history illustrations from the late Edo period, as motifs for the material. The result is an effective portrayal of technology as a conduit for the integration of man and nature.

First was the “Dandelion Wine” for Mukawa City in Hokkaido, famous for their fields of dandelions. The exquisite illustration was modified each year, with an additional puffball. The following year, he produced “Hakkin Bottle” for the Masuichi-Ichimura Sake Brewery . In 1998 and then in 2002, Hara conceived an innovative signage project for two hospitals; the Umeda Hospital in 1998 and the Katta Hospital in 2002. There are 2 interesting things about these designs. First is that the signage is made from cloth. The cloth is also removable and washable, allowing staff workers to maintain a sterile and clean feeling. The concept was derived from restaurants, who welcome their guests with a clean white tablecloth. The second noticeable characteristic is the bold typography uses as a systematic method to guide people to their destinations.

I feel like I’ve gained additional insight from studying his work so closely. And while there is so much more great work I’d like to show you, I feel I should conclude with HAPTIC, an exhibition organized by Hara, which is sort of a culmination of his work and ideas. For this exhibition, Hara recruited 21 international designers and architects and challenged them to recreate common objects driven by our 5 senses. The results, which include hair lanterns, tofu geta slippers and water pachinko, are astounding. The show first opened in Japan in 2004. In 2007 it traveled to RIBA in London. Now it is showing through the end of September at the Lighthouse, in Scotland. If anyone is nearby I urge you to visit this show. I just really really hope that it makes its way to the U.S.! If you would like to read up on Hara, he published a fantastic book titled “Designing Design.” It was published in Japanese in 2003 and then translated into English last year. What to watch for from Hara in the future? 1) a collaboration with rock star architect Shigeru Ban, 2) ongoing “Ex-Formation” project with his students and 3) 2 hotel projects which he’s been rumored to be working on.","post_categories":["Industrial Design"],"post_tags":["Kenya Hara"],"date":"September 18, 2008"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Kenchikukagu by Atelier OPA","content":"In order to greater serve the increasingly popular concept of Skeleton Infill (SI) housing (a concept in which the skeleton of the house is preserved while the insides change) in Japan, Atelier OPA has designed a series of collapsible work, sleep and eat stations.

SO TIRED opened in April of 2006 in the business district of Marunouchi. The concept was to create a church-like atmosphere where businessmen can relax after (or during) a hard days work. The stained glass is a nice touch that creates a unique environment, very uncommon to Japan. But what’s even more impressive are the chairs. If you look closely you’ll notice that on the rear of the chairs there is a bible holder. These are actual church chairs imported from Europe.  SO TIRED serves a blend of Cantonese and Western cuisine. And, quite contrary to what the name suggests, high-octane woks and energetic staffers characterize the general feel of the shop. The design is comforting, but not too noisy or overpowering, something that the 2 designers emphasize in all of their work.  Since 1997 to the present, their stores have been met with enthusiastic intrigue. Is it a coffee shop? Is it a restaurant? That ambiguity was probably what was needed to interfere with the rigid structure of day-to-day Japanese lifestyle. That ambiguity was probably what was so relaxing about cafes, and what kept people coming back. Ichiro Katami and Uichi Yamamoto possessed the foresight to identify the needs of Japanese consumers, proposing solutions through elegantly designed cafes. Perhaps that, over their artistic skills, was the true genius behind the duo. That concludes my piece on the Japanese Cafe boom.

And everyone has their favorite. They embody a certain hip, casual and chic lifestyle. But the café wasn’t always around. It’s actually a relatively recent phenomenon. This is a short history of the designers who started it all.  During the Summer of 1997, emerged in a quiet upscale residential neighborhood, near Komazawa Olympic Park where the 1940 Tokyo Olympics were slated to occur, but were cancelled due to the war. The shop was designed by under the direction of , a charismatic duo who later would become known as the godfathers of contemporary interior design.  At the time there was nothing like it. Bowery Kitchen wasn’t a restaurant, nor was it a coffee shop. With its naked concrete walls and exposed wiring, its metallic interior and open kitchen, the industrial café was both ambiguous yet to the point. And it instantly met the needs of a niche group of people. At first it was mostly wealthy residents of the neighborhood, with their finely trimmed French poodles (pets were allowed inside), who adorned the tables. But word spread of this new concept and the crowds began lining up. Bowery Kitchen was once featured in BRUTUS magazine as “a shop that is worth waiting 1 hour to get in.” After that, you were lucky to get in within an hour.  ","post_categories":[],"post_tags":[],"date":"August 12, 2008"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Japan’s Cafe Boom | Part 2","content":"Three years after Bowery Kitchen stole the hearts of Tokyoites, a second project by and , Lotus, opened its doors in Omotesando, just off of the main avenue lined with luxury boutiques. Yamamoto had recently taken a trip to New York and, upon returning, mentioned that New York offered its city dwellers so many options, a luxury that Tokyo did not have. Thus, Lotus was to become a Japanese eatery that one might find in New York.   The retro-futuristic interior is achieved through florescent-pink walls, a vaulted ceiling with bold lighting and lotus-paneled walls.  Depending on what time – of year and of day – you visit Lotus (it’s open until 4am) you will probably have very different impression. Yamamoto believes that, like its customers, the restaurant is alive; it should change, much like its patrons change. The walls may get painted a different color, the menu may rotate depending on the season, and tables may get rearranged. However, the central theme remains the same.    Yamamoto once said that the chairs and tables were deliberately placed close together so as to create the environment of an energetic eatery. This can definitely be felt if you visit Lotus during later hours. The bicker of people next to you, shouting from the kitchen, and orders being announced over the speakers can almost be overwhelming. But the result was undisputed. Something had changed within the Japanese landscape of restaurants and interiors.

Eyes remained fixated on and , who were planning their 3rd project together. This time they were involving more people; fashion retailer JUN Group and graphic design company positron. Katami and Yamamoto’s style continued to evolve, but their philosophy was solid. They believed that good design was necessary, but should not be overpowering. Design should be responsible for solving the little problems that make people slightly uncomfortable. Design should cause you to inhabit the space, making you come back and, even after the 10th visit, should make you say “I like this place.” During December of 2002, opened its doors to much anticipation.  Located in Harajuku, the 3-story building boasts floor to ceiling windows and glamorous interiors with black leather seating. Much like their previous designs, details are calculated and deliberate. There is no sign or menu outside, giving the café a snobbish and arrogant feel. Upon entering you are greeted with a “Hello,” a shocking deviation for the traditional and ultra-polite welcoming.  Seating by the windows is bright and casual, while the inner depths of the café are dark and romantic. The 3rd floor is the most glamorous of all, but at night there is a cover charge.  At a time when Harajuku – known for its rockabilly dancers and cosplay teenagers – was fighting for its identity, Katami and Yamamoto successfully identified the needs of group of individuals, and filled that gap using an appropriate, and perhaps necessary, design.","post_categories":[],"post_tags":[],"date":"August 14, 2008"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Shiro Kuramata","content":"I don’t think that many people would argue the claim that was one of Japan’s most important industrial designers.

Images courtesy of Nikon Ito’s images of Tokyo Bay, are reminiscent of Hiroshi Sugimoto’s Seascapes from the 1980s. And while Sugimoto’s images are calming in their assessment of air, water and life, Ito’s, on the contrary, are eerie and foreshadowing. Perhaps it is the context in which the artist positions his images as being of Tokyo Bay; directly behind us, cut out of our vantage point, lies one of the worlds largest metropolitan cities.

One of the unique characteristics of this show is that it features contemporary artists who are currently active, as well as pieces from the Taisho (1912-1926) and Showa (1926-1989) periods that are housed in the Museums archives, rarely coming out into public. Here are some highlights: (all images are courtesy of MOT unless otherwise noted) (image courtesy of nicolasbuffe.com ) As you come off the escalator on the 3rd floor the show opens with a work by Nicolas Buffe , a French artist currently based out of Tokyo. The word “grotesque” originates from the Italian word grotta, or cave, and refers to the designs that were unearthed by the Romans during the 15th century. You can read more about it HERE, but the chalk drawings essentially illustrate a dark mythical garden, much like the one that the Romans discovered. The next piece you encounter as you make your way out of the cave is a Taisho era piece (1916) by . This was one of my favorite pieces of the entire show. Michisei was known for his detailed sketches of shrubs and flowers around his home. Starring at the pieces, which, all except for the paper they were drawn on, appear frozen in time, I was reminded of the importance of observation, and how the act of looking helps us establish our place in the surrounding environment. More than halfway through the exhibition I found myself mesmerized by the etchings of . For the majority of his career, Nakabayashi has focused on the theme of “decomposition.” Looking at his several “Transposition” print series, I began to think about the ephemeral qualities of nature, and how a garden (nature cultivated by human hands) would not retain its form for very long without us. In that sense, the garden truly is a “record” of our existence. The culminating piece of the show is by a relatively young painter named (31 yrs old). To simply describe the piece, on one large canvas Uchiumi has attached a myriad of smaller canvases, each possessing its own colors and, from close up, each standing alone as a separate piece of artwork. Entitled “3 thousand worlds,” the work refers to the Buddhist concept of “A great World System of a Billion Worlds.” ( source ) All in all I thought it was a very strong show. And very spiritual. My family was not religious but it must be my western influence, because I often associate a “garden” with the Garden of Eden. To me, the Garden of Eden represents a transition in which Adam and Eve become aware of self-knowledge, and for that they are banished from the sanctuary. What I took away from the show was that we, along with our knowledge and human skill-sets, are responsible for cultivating our own garden.","post_categories":["Art","Go and See"],"post_tags":["garden"],"date":"May 21, 2008"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Oslo Opera House","content":"How would you like to take a dip and then take in an Opera? Opera House in Oslo, Norway by Snohetta .  The Oslo Opera House (Norwegian: Operahuset) is home to The Norwegian National Opera and Ballet, and the national opera theatre in Norway. The building lies in Bjørvika , in the center of Oslo. It was built by Statsbygg , a government-run property owner. The architects were the Norwegian firm Snohetta who were also the architects of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina (the Library of Alexandria) in Egypt.     The theatre designers were Theatre Projects Consultants based in London, the acoustic designers were BrekkeStrandArup, a joint venture between local consultant Brekke Strand Akustikk and international acousticians Arup Acoustics . Norwegian construction company Veidekke was awarded one of the largest building contracts of the project. The structure provides a total area of 38,500 m² and includes 1,100 rooms, one of which has 1,350 seats and another has up to 400 seats. The project broke ground in 2004 with a budget of 4.4 billion NOK, but finished ahead of schedule in 2007, and 300 million NOK under budget. At the 1-year anniversary the opera house had logged 1.3 million visitors.  Opera and ballet are young art forms in Norway. These art forms evolve in an international setting . The Bjørvika peninsula is part of a harbor city, which is historically the meeting point with the rest of the world.. The dividing line between the ground ‘here’ and the water ‘there’ is both a real and a symbolic threshold. This threshold is realized as a large wall on the line of the meeting between land and sea, Norway and the world, art and everyday life. This is the threshold where the public meet the art.  A detailed brief was developed as a basis for the competition. Snøhetta proposed that the production facilities of the opera house should be realized as a self contained, rationally planned ‘factory’. This factory should be both functional and flexible during the planning phase as well as in later use. This flexibility has proved to be very important during the planning phase: a number of rooms and room groups have been adjusted in collaboration with the end user. These changes have improved the buildings functionality without affecting the architecture.  The competition brief stated that the opera house should be of high architectural quality and should be monumental in it’s expression. One idea stood out as a legitimation of this monumentality: The concept of togetherness, joint ownership, easy and open access for all. To achieve a monumentality based on these notions we wished to make the opera accessible in the widest possible sense, by laying out a ‘carpet’ of horizontal and sloping surfaces on top of the building. This carpet has been given an articulated form, related to the cityscape. Monumentality is achieved through horizontal extension and not verticality. The conceptual basis of the competition, and the final building, is a combination of these three elements – The wave wall, the factory and the carpet.  The main auditorium is a classic horseshoe theater built for opera and ballet. It houses approx. 1370 visitors divided between stalls, perterre, and three balconies. Technical spaces occupies the area above balcony 3. The orchestra pit is highly flexible and can be adjusted in height and area with the use of three separate lifts.   The stage curtain is also an important element in the auditorium. Together with the chandelier and seat fabric it is a contrast to the dark timber. It has been made by the American artist Pae White , following an international competition. She has worked with digital images of aluminum foil which reflects and adopts the colors of the auditorium. These images are then transferred to a computer driven loom.  The exterior of the opera house becomes diffuse as night falls. The large timber ‘wave wall’ in the foyer is illuminated and the building takes on a completely different character. The interior becomes the façade. It shows how interdependent the interior and exterior of the building are.  all images © Snohetta, Nina Reistad, Statsbygg, Erik Berg & Nicolas Buisson ","post_categories":["Architecture"],"post_tags":["architecture-public-space"],"date":"May 22, 2008"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Makoto Azuma","content":"I’m starting my memorial day weekend early, but I have a very special post for you before I end my weekend.

I’m more interested in creating a painting as a space to occupy.” Lin conquers his spaces by adorning them with blown-up versions of traditional Taiwanese floral motifs. He then invites the viewers to interact with his pieces – much like one would in their own room – by sitting, sleeping and walking on them.  I felt that Lin’s work was super appropriate to show in my last post of the series because it is sort of a culmination of what I have been seeing, and what I have been trying to show my readers.

In her most recent work in the grand exhibition space on the 8th floor of the Hermès store in Tokyo, Sze uses common consumer objects  – everything from lamps to pillows to cardboard boxes, thread, sheets of paper, chemistry sets, humidifiers and toy cranes – to create a giant standing sculpture. The objects, piled high toward the ceiling, toy with our sense of fear and stability. Precarious as it appears, the structure reassures us (does it?) with it’s numerous suspension ropes that invoke images of grand engineering feats such as bridges and skyscrapers. Also at play are the many scattered objects on the floor that guide our eyes to the main structure. It almost looks like a sprawling urban city.","post_categories":["Architecture","Art"],"post_tags":[],"date":"April 14, 2008"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Intersections of Fine Art and Architecture PART2","content":"The next work I’d like to examine in my series on the convergence of fine art and architecture, is one that has been quite prominent in  the media and I’m sure many of you have seen pictures.

As you can see, interiors are an actual media that the artist works with, covering their floors with colorful vinyl tape and, in the process, revitalizing the space with color and energy.

It’s not very often you see the word “royal” and “café” used together, however this space has managed to pull it off. The ornamentation, such as the floral wallpaper and the lavish table (which I love!) give it a Victorian feel. The color scheme also adds to an overall sense of exquisiteness and yet they’ve managed to maintain a feeling of hominess, which is usually what keeps people coming back time after time.

The event which I would like to write about today is the “ ” exhibition currently on display at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Some of the top nominations in the INDEX Awards are also in this show, such as the . But every subject has 2 sides to the story and sustainable design is no exception. Many have voiced criticism, saying that the art is not realistic and does not take into consideration some of the dire circumstances that 3rd world nations are in. There is a well-articulated article by here. I suggest you pay a visit to the exhibition before it ends on September 23, 2007 (or visit the website) and decide for yourself. The exhibition, I believe, is an important one. Whether you believe sustainable design is truly for the good of humanity or just another self-righteous Eurocentric mechanism, there is no doubt that the theme of sustainable design has become valid in our society today and will most likely continue to gain authority in the world of design.","post_categories":["Go and See"],"post_tags":[],"date":"September 3, 2007"},{"author":"Johnny","title":"Jamo Associates","content":"A quick entry from Japan.
