Torietsu is a gem of a spot where yakitori and Japanese whiskey come together, literally, as a family. The restaurant is run by Tsuyoshi Suzuki , who, this year, fulfilled his dream of running his own eatery with his father. The son spent the last 5 years in training, working at a different yakitori shop and waiting for the right time. That time finally came when his father retired from the famed Hotel Okura after working as a bartender for 45 years. Together, they opened Torietsu in May of 2017. The eatery stocks over 80 varieties of whiskey, many from Japan, but also from other countries. They source all of their jidori chicken from Kumamoto and the son\u2019s grilling, combined with the father\u2019s whiskey selection, makes for an unforgettable pairing.

Each mascot (for now they\u2019re being referred to as A, B and C) has their own unique characteristics but the general style makes it seem as if they were created by the same artist. And many of them were inspired by Japanese folklore. They remind us of something straight out of Yokai Watch, or Pokemon. For now, the creators remain anonymous but these 3 were selected from a bucket of 1753 entries that were vetted by a group of judges. Based on our first impressions, we\u2019re going to say our favorite is Candidate B, which were inspired by Japanese folklore and fairy tales. We like A too for its visual consistency with the emblem. Candidate C is cute but looks a little too much like Jibanyan (from Yokai Watch).

The \u201c House in Shinyoshida ,\u201d as it\u2019s called, named for the neighborhood in Yokohama where it stands, was conceived shortly after the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake.

The solution was to slant the entire western-facing fa\u00e7ade and create a built-in slanted bookshelf whose shelves also function as a ladder. The slant allowed family members of all ages to climb up and reach books, but also keeps the books from falling should an earthquake ever shake the home. The slanted fa\u00e7ade also had the effect of creating an open feeling in the family room, where the home\u2019s high perch allowed for plenty of sunlight to enter through the large windows.

{"content": "During Edo period Japan, fires frequently broke out, forcing citizens to quickly relocate their entire lives. But it wasn\u2019t just fires. Situated on an active fault line and surrounded by sea, citizens of Japan were always aware of the imminent dangers posed by earthquakes and tsunamis, a mindset that led to the development of mobility culture. People shunned the idea of owning heavy furniture and, instead, opted for a more minimal lifestyle by sleeping on futons and wrapping and carrying their belongings in furoshiki. A new brand of products is proposing a return to such a culture, and has launched a suite of products inspired by their ancestors.

Taking cues from ancient Japanese artwork and historical photographs, the team has developed a suite of products that reconstruct mobility culture. They include the Futokoro minimal wallet and laptop backpack , the Futon portable sleeping pack (with optional solar panel), the Furoshiki backpack and the Samue maintenance-free suit. In a credit to their creative marketing, they even reverse-engineered their products back into historical Japanese Ukiyo-e.

{"content": "In the event of a natural disaster, a person\u2019s most basic needs \u2014\u00a0food, water, shelter, electricity\u00a0\u2014 are often compromised. But one necessity often overlooked is the availability of working toilets. In the wake of recent natural disasters in Japan such as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami and the Kumamoto earthquakes of 2016, Tokyo-based design company nendo teamed up with hardware supplier Sugita-Ace to combat this problem by designing a simple, innovative portable toilet kit they\u2019ve dubbed the minimLET. One of the biggest challenges of designing a portable toilet is, quite simply, its portability. Nendo\u2019s designers downsized their toilet kit into six items: a toilet seat, aluminum pipes, nylon tent cloth, pocket tissues, garbage bags and coagulant. Bulky elements such as the tent or the toilet seat had to be either scaled down or eliminated entirely. The minimLET works around these issues by having multifunctional parts: the aluminum poles can be used to prop up the toilet seat or support the nylon tent, which can also function as a poncho. Cheap, everyday items can also add functionality to the kit, and in a modern city like Tokyo, are often available at or near evacuation centers. Bearing this in mind, the minimLET\u2019s structure can also be supported with a plastic umbrella, tin cans, or plastic bottles. The entire kit fits into a bag about the size of a laptop case. The bag itself has a gusseted bottom which can hold up to 16 liters of water, or roughly the amount needed for two toilet flushes. The minimLET is scheduled for retail launch in 2018 in Japan. With the increasing frequency of natural disasters and the limited access to toilets in many developing countries, one hopes that portable toilet kits like the minimLET can serve people in need worldwide.", "date": "October 25, 2017", "author": "Rachel Mimms", "post_categories": ["Industrial Design"], "post_tags": ["Nendo"]},

{"content": "Some things never go out of style; just ask the four artisans behind the group BUAISOU who still use natural centuries-old Japanese indigo dyeing techniques for their creations today. A recent mention in Vogue proves that this \u201cJapan Blue\u201d is still highly fashionable. And judging by the vibrant hues Japanese indigo dye produces, it\u2019s no surprise why. Japanese indigo is incredibly versatile. Sukumo, the type used by BUAISOU, contains properties that prevent it from transferring or bleeding onto other garments, even white ones. The intensity of the indigo changes based on factors such as how long the fabric mixes with the dye or the way it is dipped into the dye vats. As a result, each object dyed with sukumo indigo is truly unique. The dye is derived from the leaves of the Japanese indigo plant that is native to Tokushima prefecture, where BUAISOU\u2019s farm and studio are located. Once harvested, the indigo leaves are dried and then fermented in a vat of ash lye, wheat bran, and calcium hydroxide. The indigo color is the result of oxidization when fabric is dipped into the dye and exposed to the air. Indigo dyeing in Japan dates back to the 12th century in Tokushima prefecture on the island of Shikoku. For a large part of Japanese history, Tokushima was the center of Japan\u2019s indigo production \u2014 until the creation of synthetic indigo in the 20th century. Now the number of indigo farms in Japan has dwindled from over a thousand to just four, including the one operated by BUAISOU. Nevertheless, the cultural significance of Tokushima\u2019s traditional indigo dye remains: it was designated as an intangible cultural property by the Japanese government in 1968. BUAISOU\u2019s vision involves \u201cpreserving the tradition of Japanese indigo,\u201d and bringing \u201cnew vitality to \u2018Japan Blue\u2019 through our artistic and functional creations.\u201d Many of these creations can be purchased on their online store or made by hand at any of their public workshops.", "date": "October 30, 2017", "author": "Rachel Mimms", "post_categories": ["Fashion"], "post_tags": ["tradition"]},

And his images manifest in the form of magazine covers, which take on different titles depending on the subject. The images began to gain traction online and \u201cpeople began to look for the real magazine, but there is only the cover that he makes and posts online,\u201d explains Sheila Cliffe, in her book The Social Life of Kimono . \u201cHe liked the idea that the internet can bring into reality something that did not exist before.\u201d Akira insists on working with normal people, instead of models, who travel from all over Japan to his studio in Yamagata in the Northeast part of the country. And now, for the first time, over 120 old and new images are being compiled into Kimono Times , a definitive collection that represents the best of Akira\u2019s 10 years of work. The bilingual 144-page book is being released in October of 2017 and will retail for 5500 yen.

Looking at them, it\u2019s easy to forget that we\u2019re connected to that time by what is merely a blink of an eye in the grand scale of history. And so it\u2019s worth colorizing old black and white photos if only for the contemporaneity, with which we use to learn from history. The process, however, was painstakingly manual. Even with digital software, colorists have had so colorize the images piece-by-piece; pixel-by-pixel. But now, a team of Japanese researchers at Waseda University, led by Dr. Ishikawa, has utilized artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning to create a program that automatically colorizes photographs. The task was accomplished through the deep learning and color matching of 2.3 million color photographs. Dr. Watanabe of the Tokyo Metropolitan University, then built on that technology by adding data from research on the colors of architectural elements of the past. He\u2019s then been posting the photographs to his twitter account with some historical tid-bits. Here, we present a few of our favorites but you can follow him at @hwtnv for more.

Three years of planning \u2013 both in building equipment and obtaining government permits \u2013 came to fruition this summer when, in late August, Azuma sailed out into the Suruga bay. His team of 15 proceeded to plunge 4 exquisite bouquets of flowers and one bonsai 2000 meters, or a little more than 1 mile, down to the sea floor. Each plant was secured in the center of a steel-infused plastic frame that was also equipped with lights and photographic equipment. \u201cIn contrast to the bright summer daylight at the foot of Mount Fuji, the flowers will be swallowed slowly into the darkness, where not a single ray of light shines,\u201d said the artist.

Tada often elects to include himself in the dense drawing, or sometimes his furry friend mosh, who appears in his comics.

Peering through its large glass windows as it glistened among the grey and brown apartment buildings, residents and tourists alike speculated about its use. Was it Kusama\u2019s residence?

Without any explanation, the Yayoi Kusama Museum , along with a new website, announced that the museum was now ready to open. Accordingly, the ground level will house the entrance and gift shop. Floors 2 and 3 will be exhibition spaces for Kusama\u2019s works while the 4 floor will be dedicated to the artist\u2019s Instagram-friendly immersive installations. The 5 floor will serve as a reading room dedicated to storing documents and material relating to Kusama and her work. It will also contain an outdoor space.

{"content": "Matsushima , a port town in Miyagi Prefecture, has one of the most picturesque bays in all of Japan. But don\u2019t just take our word for it. It\u2019s considered to be 1 of \u201cThree Views of Japan,\u201d a select list of the country\u2019s 3 most celebrated scenic sights. So instead of coping with the swarms of tourists in Tokyo and Kyoto, we recently had the opportunity to head up North because beaches and seafood were calling our name. If you\u2019re traveling from Tokyo, Sendai Station will be your hub where you get off the Shinkansen and transfer to a local train. But don\u2019t just pass through. Spend some time in this station because there\u2019s so many good eats. We recommend trying some zunda, a local treat made from ground edamame. Zunda-mochi and zunda-shakes (we tried both) are two common variations. We also highly recommend the sake shop, which has a vending machine to top all Japanese vending machines. It has a sake tasting vending machine that, for 100 yen, will poor you small cups of different local sake. It\u2019s like playing the slot machines except you never lose. Take the JR Senseki Line to Matsushimakaigan Station, a quaint little platform of a stop that looks over Matsushima Bay. A short walk and you\u2019ll reach a pier where ferrys take you off on a 1-hour cruise that circles the bay and follows the route explored by Japanese haiku master Matsuo Basho. It\u2019s a wonderful way to get acquainted with a region that is blessed with some of the most beautiful island scenery in the country. The boat passes many islands, each with a different name and a distinct shape and form. A few steps down the pier is Godaido Temple and the vermillion bridge connecting, which connects the small island to the coast. Depending on your fear of heights (or your leg span), the bridge could be quite harrowing. Planks are deliberately spaced far apart so that you must look down, through the planks, and at the sea below as you cross. The present structure was built in 1604 by Date Masamune. In the temple are installed images of the five guardian Buddhist deities. Walking around the temple you can see some fantastic craftwork that includes the zodiac animals carved into all four walls. There aren\u2019t too many places where you can get up-close and personal with a 400-year old temple, and then turn around to be surrounded by the beauty of the sea. This isn\u2019t for everyone but if you\u2019re into it, Ume Luv , which is conveniently located right near the port, offers kimono rentals. For 5000 yen you can select from over 200 designs and the gracious host will fit you up so you\u2019re ready to go. You can then walk around the historic temples, sit down for green tea and sweets and take in the scenery, all the while feeling as though you\u2019ve been transported back in time. There\u2019s a wonderful little tea house called kanran-tei right nearby where you can do such a thing. Whether you\u2019re clothed in traditional kimono attire or not, a stroll through Matsushima\u2019s best-known structure and the most famous Zen temple in northern Japan is definitely worth it. Located just a couple minutes\u2019 walk from Matsushima Kaigan Pier, its entrance is shaded by tall cedar trees. The green carpet of moss below the trees sets the stage for the calm, serene environment. Highlights include the pathway leading to the temple, which is dotted with caves and grottoes dug out by priests long ago. The impressive main hall and its interior, which features wood-carved transoms and brilliantly painted, gold-plated fusuma. If you\u2019ve been following our recommendations, the day is probably coming to an end. But before you pack it up for the night, head to Ootakamori for one last excursion. The relatively small mountain is an enjoyable 30-min hike that will take you 350ft above water for a fantastic view over the sea and islands. And while the sunset is certainly breathtaking, making the hike any time of day is worthwhile. The mountain is a bit out of the way so check to see if your lodge offers a shuttle. Speaking of lodging, Matsushima has plenty of inn and hotels for all budgets. One of the more high-end hotels is Ubudo , which is large but not too large. The food is amazing, the rooms and rooftop baths are luxurious. And it has this cool Southeast-Asian island vibe. For the budget-conscious traveler there are also many Ryokan-style inns and one of them is Chidorikan . The rooms are sparse but clean; the meals (which are included) are just as amazing as any high-end hotel. And it\u2019s just steps from the sea. For the active and adventurous, Matsushima offers a host of experience-based activities like sea kayaking, boat fishing and boat steering. Try your hand at operating a fishing boat (with an instructor by your side) or traditional basket fishing (keep what you catch!). At the very least, let a local fisherman take you out on the sea for an experience you won\u2019t forget.", "date": "August 11, 2017", "author": "Johnny", "post_categories": ["Go and See"], "post_tags": ["spoon tamago guide"]},

And if you\u2019re looking to do some domestic traveling around Japan but not sure where to go, planning your trip around one of these isn\u2019t a bad idea. We\u2019ve got you covered from the North, all the way to the South. The inaugural Reborn Art Festival, is a celebration of art, music and food and is being held in Ishinomaki, one of Miyagi prefecture\u2019s hardest hit regions during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Musical acts are performing daily for the 51-day festival and a roster of international and Japanese artists have installed artwork throughout Ishinomaki City and Oshika Peninsula. Artists include Yayoi Kusama, Kohei Nawa, Chim Pom, Bruce Nauman and JR\u2019s Inside Out project. Artwork is a little spread out but organizers have free shuttle buses that take you around to different locations. The festival is coming to an end soon but it\u2019s up through September 10th, 2017. General admission passports are 3,000 yen. Occuring every 3 years, as the name indicates, the Yokohama Triennial is back for a 6th season. Based on the theme \u201cIslands, Constellations & Galapagos,\u201d the triennial will examine \u201cConnectivity\u201d and \u201cIsolation\u201d in in our current world, promising to be a timely event as our digitally-connected world faces protectionism and xenophobia. Key highlights include a large-scale installation by Ai Wei Wei and work by other internationally renowned artists like Jenny Holzer, Olafur Eliasson, Yoi Kawakubo and Sam Durant. Venues are all close together and include Yokohama Museum of Art, Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse No.1 and Yokohama Port Opening Memorial Hall and the Triennial is currently on view through November 5, 2017.

{"content": "As a child, growing up in Japan, there was one book that terrified me. Luckily, I didn\u2019t own it. The red hardback sat on the bottom shelf in my friend\u2019s room and every time I went over to play I could see it, out of the corner of my eye, staring me in the face. Once we pulled it out and flipped through the pages; each featured a grotesquely illustrated realm of hell with scenes of fire, torture, and suffering. It was, I assure you, a children\u2019s book. But it was made for parents to use as leverage whenever their child acted up, or misbehaved. And boy was it effective. These concepts of hell ( ; \u5730\u7344 in Japanese) are derived from ancient Buddhist scriptures, and I\u2019m ceaselessly amazed by the imagination of the monks and artists who came up with so many different forms of punishment. The range from the fairly standard \u2013 being eaten alive by demons and dragons, or being torn apart at the crotch \u2013 to the more inventive \u2013 being forced to hold large stalks of daikon radish in your mouth and being used as a drumstick. Then, there\u2019s my favorite: being flattened out by a roller and then cut up into soba noodles. Now, a new art book that\u2019s being released in October has collected a wide range of images that depict hell in Japanese art from the 12th century to the 19th century. The massive single-volume collection consists of almost 600 pages of works designated as Japanese National Treasures and features the various depictions of hell by artists such as Kazunobu Kan\u014d,Yoshitoshi Tsukioka and the master of horror Ky\u014dsai Kawanabe.

{"content": "Getting arrested is a scary experience in every country, but perhaps even more so in Japan, where the conviction rate is over 99% . Last month, the Japanese government passed a new anti-terror conspiracy law that has drawn controversy among Japanese citizens who feel it is a threat to civil liberties and privacy. Artist Megumi Igarashi (pen name Rokudenashiko), famously arrested in 2014 on charges of obscenity for distributing 3D data of her genitals, is creating a set of playing cards that educate people about what it\u2019s like to be arrested in Japan. Critics of the anti-conspiracy law claim it is too broadly worded and contains acts that have little to no connection to terrorism, such as: copying music, picking mushrooms in conservation forests, and competing in a motor boat race without a license. No stranger to the absurdity of Japanese law, Ms. Igarashi is responding by making a tongue-in-cheek karuta card game set depicting scenarios of arrest and imprisonment in Japan partly based on her own experiences.
