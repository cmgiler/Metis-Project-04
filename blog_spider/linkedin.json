Since then, we’ve been hard at work identifying ways to make this experience even more valuable, and encourage even greater transparency when it comes to conversations about pay. That’s why today we are announcing Salary Insights: a new way for you to explore compensation details on open roles. This feature will appear on job listings and will show an estimated or expected salary range for the role, based on data from our 546+ million members and employer provided information. We know salary insights on job listings is important to you. In fact, a recent survey found that more than 70% of professionals want to hear about salary in the first message from a recruiter. By surfacing this information early on in the process, we hope to make the application process more seamless by allowing you to know if a job meets your salary criteria before entering into a conversation with the hiring manager. The salary information displayed on job listings will come from one of two places: Employers can provide salary ranges for specific jobs, meaning you will know exactly what kind of compensation to expect before you apply for the job. If an employer does not provide a salary for a role, we will show you an estimated range from member-submitted data. You’ll also notice a couple other changes, including the ability to delete your salary information privately in your settings as your career evolves, which will always remain confidential to you and never shared on an individual level. We’ll also periodically remind you to update your salary to ensure you’re getting the most out of the tool. Explore and to see if that perfect role for you is already listed. You’ll start to see LinkedIn estimated salary on job openings in the coming weeks."},{"post_categories":["Advance Your Career","LinkedIn Tips"],"author":"Page Williams","title":"LinkedIn, J.Crew, and WeWork Set the Stage for Success","date":"February 14, 2018","content":"If you were to stop what you're doing – literally, right now – and ask yourself, “How do you define success? What are you in it for?” Would the answer come easily? No matter your response, the good news is there is no right answer. The definition of success is personal and constantly evolving – and so is how people think, feel, and even talk about it. This is why LinkedIn, J.Crew, and WeWork are teaming up to debut a new discussion series, to inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs and goal-getters and hear what they have to say about success, and I had the opportunity to kick-off the first discussion this week at WeWork SF. At the debut @Work: Style Your Success panel, I was joined by , CEO of ; , Founder of ; , Founder & Editor, ; and , Director of Digital Community, WeWork. From first jobs at Chuck E. Cheese to overcoming career obstacles, here are some key conversation highlights that can help you discover what you’re . Since professionals spend 90,000 hours working over the course of a lifetime, LinkedIn took a look at what really fuels professionals to do what they do – and we found some interesting nuggets. If you’re going to be making that type of time investment, you’ll want to ensure that what you’re working toward truly maps back to your definition of success. For Cynthia, whose organization focuses on achieving gender equality, it includes increased access to the resources every female has the right to, like education and health services, in order to achieve their full potential. For Michelle, whose mission involves connecting Black-owned brands to conscious consumers, success is providing the support that is needed for Black businesses to succeed. No matter where we are in our journeys or how we define success, one thing is clear – we’re all on our own paths, but we’re also all #InItTogether. LinkedIn’s research also found that only 4% of professionals think the corner office is a top indicator of success. Now it's about being your own boss – more than one-third (34%) of professionals would take a 10% pay-cut for the ability to design their own schedule. What does this tell us? Success evolves over time, and for many of us, it might even evolve from one day to the next. And that’s okay – success for Michelle might mean something different than it did in her first job playing the iconic restaurant mouse mascot, Chuck E. Cheese. Amanda shared that after college graduation she came to the pivotal realization that success is personal – it doesn’t need to match someone else’s definition. The key is in recognizing that success evolves and embracing that journey. An overwhelming majority (87%) of professionals say success isn’t just about what you accomplish in your life, it’s about what you inspire others to do. After facing her own career obstacles, Michelle dedicated herself to helping business owners who didn’t always have access to opportunity. And to put it in Victoria’s words, “It’s not about using your community, it’s about being of use to your community.” Community is a powerful thing. The people in our network are a part of our success journey, just as we’re a part of theirs. As Cynthia puts it, “My community is every woman.” Helping others see their value and where their voice can and should be heard is the ultimate form of community. No matter what success means to you, consider the many journeys of those around you, and the true beauty of being #InItTogether.

The thought was that you were born with a certain level of fitness that couldn’t be enhanced - even with exercise. Clearly there was a misconception. “Joy” is encountering a similar experience at this very moment. Some perceive joy and happiness to be things that we cannot develop intuitive muscle for over time. However, our most recent Speaker Series guest, would beg to differ. As Google’s former “Jolly Good Fellow,” he was tasked with with solving spiritual and mental unhappiness within the company. He recently took time to speak with us and share the simple task of “cultivating the mind” to access joy to in turn, develop happiness, productivity, and appreciation in all facets of life. Meng’s insights can be applied broadly, but he emphasized that taking this joyful mindset at your place of work is especially beneficial. It only makes sense that the more joyful you are at work, the happier, more motivated, and productive you are. “Cultivating the mind” may sound like a tall order, but Meng insists that it is not. In fact, he not only assured everyone that it was simple, but offered advice for how anyone can train their happiness with a few easy steps for sourcing joy: First and foremost, putting the mind at rest is essential to attaining joy. This can be done with a practice as simple as concentrating on your breathing, and ultimately freeing yourself of stressful, worrying, and distracting thoughts. When the mind is clear, calm, and at ease, joy will arise. Calming yourself forces you to concentrate on the present -- not the future, which elicits stress, nor the past, which is where regret thrives. Our lives are interwoven with an uncountable number of joyful moments that are simply overlooked - sourcing joy is just the practice of being aware of them. Whether it’s the sensation of having your first cup of coffee or just taking a step back to enjoy a gorgeous sunset, being able to train the mind to find joy interwoven in life can make the difference of a lifetime - literally. Take time - even if just a little - to share, give, offer, and wish goodness and happiness upon others. In return, you’ll intrinsically enable inner joy. Wishing for joy upon others is a highly powerful tactic for cultivating inner happiness of your own. In following these three simple steps to cultivate an acute awareness of joy, Meng is adamant that you’ll be equipped to enhance your approach to happiness and ultimately, life. Because with the added enhancement of joy….  Positive experiences become more positive Neutral experiences become more joyful, because they will no longer be taken for granted And negative experiences, or emotions of pain, become more manageable because the moments of unadulterated joy from within them will be identifiable ….and who wouldn’t want that?

People are thinking about exploring new opportunities and updating their LinkedIn profiles to help land a new job that's right for them. When it comes to perfecting your profile, the words you choose are a vitally important factor in helping you get you noticed by recruiters. So to help, we've taken a look at the top words professionals used to describe themselves in this year's Top 10 Global Buzzwords and dug into why so many people are choosing these words. Specialize Experienced Skilled Leadership Passionate Expert Motivated Creative Strategic Focused I’m as guilty as anyone in using some of these words in my profile, so it did get us thinking – why do many of us choose these words and has the way we describe ourselves changed over time? When we reviewed the Buzzwords from the last five years, one of the biggest changes was the shift towards highlighting skills and experiences over personal strengths. For example, professionals were less likely to describe themselves as ‘successful’ last year despite describing themselves as more ‘skilled’. In fact, the word ‘successful’ dropped out of the top 10 for the first time since 2015, while ‘skilled’ entered the ranks for the first time. To help understand what this all means for the modern-day job seeker, we turned to from the University of Reading. “This narrowing down from generic terms to far more specific words such as ‘skilled’ and ‘experienced’ reflects a change in job roles that are becoming more specialised,” says Professor Jones. “Roles in the banking and pharma sector, for example, are under increasing scrutiny and as a result require more verifiable skills and attributes.” ‘Expert’ re-entered the top 10 in 2016, while ‘specialized’ topped the global list in both 2016 and 2017, as professionals look to verify their expertise. “This type of language can be viewed as a wider comment on how society is searching for accountability and verifiability; in part a reaction to the increasing focus on ‘fake news’ surrounding the 2016 U.S. Presidential election and Brexit referendum. Where once there was a focus on branding one’s own authenticity, economic uncertainty means authenticity is no longer important, it’s about verifiability.” The Buzzwords data also reveals an increased use of ‘leadership’ in recent years, jumping in at number one in 2015’s list and maintaining a presence in the top five ever since. Professor Jones explains, “Companies are becoming less hierarchical - even junior members are expected to demonstrate leadership. In contrast, ‘organised’ fell out of the top ten after 2015 as professionals search to demonstrate management capabilities over more functional attributes.” If you’ve been thinking about a fresh start or a change in direction then your LinkedIn profile is a good place to begin. With recruiters using keywords to identify the ideal candidates, think about the words you’re using and choose them wisely. There has never been a better time to ensure the words you choose are selling you as powerfully as they would do in an interview. Do you use these words? Does Professor Jones’ analysis ring true to you?

From finishing college to being featured on  Forbes 30 Under 30 list, Haben embodies the positive change she wants to see in this world, all while being an influential advocate for the disabilities community of nearly 1.3 billion people that makes up a fifth of the world’s population. All too often when we hear “disability,” we tend to instinctively associate it with a barrier that separates ability from action. However, Haben explains that if we’re able to break down that barrier and shift this thinking to focus on disability as an opportunity to develop new solutions, drive innovation, and foster inclusion, everyone benefits, regardless of their abilities. Whether it’s as simple as adding subtitles to a video, or as complex as engineering a building that is accommodating to people of all levels of mobility, if we plan for accessibility from the start it will lead to better design, increased accessibility, and opportunity for all. But, it’s not just companies and decision makers that have influence to help drive these changes in thinking.

Something drives you. Every one of us has our own motivations, our own inspiration and our own distinct notion of what constitutes success. In other words, we’re all in it for very different reasons. And we’re all at different points on our journey. Some of us feel on the right track, for others, success feels very far away. A few months ago, we started asking ourselves and our members “what are you in it for?” “It” is work and everything associated with work, and the answers are as unique as the over 500 million members on LinkedIn.

Regardless of the motivation or reason, no one wants to go it alone. Whatever you’re in it for, you want to know there is a community of people to help, support, inspire and push you. That community is LinkedIn, professionals from every walk of life, with incredibly varied backgrounds, experiences and motivations. We’ve spent time capturing the stories of some of these people on LinkedIn and their individual stories: says he should be a statistic, but dance helped him escape.

You’re Not Alone…","date":"November 15, 2017","content":"By now you’ve likely heard of the quarter-life crisis — a period of insecurity and doubt that many people in their mid 20s to early 30s go through surrounding their career, relationships, and finances. Chances are good you may experience your own. In fact, 75% of 25-33 year olds have experienced a quarter-life crisis, often related to feeling like they are at a crossroad in their career. We took a look at this phenomenon and talked to thousands of professionals globally on whether they’ve experienced a quarter-life crisis, what triggered it, and the career implications. Here’s what we discovered, along with tips for how the LinkedIn community can help you navigate this stage in your life. While most people have experienced a quarter-life crisis, what exactly is causing this anxiety? Sixty-one percent say finding a job or career they’re passionate about is the number one cause. Another top reason is comparing themselves to their more successful friends. Nearly half (48%) say this has caused them anxiety, with women feeling this even more than men (51% vs. 41%). People in this age range feel a lot of uncertainty and frustration around their careers, even more so than pressure around their relationships and personal life goals. #Tip: Remember that everyone is at a different stage in their professional journey. Think about what makes you happy in your career and beyond, and establish goals that help you work towards your definition of success. Going through this stressful period can lead those in their 20s and 30s to make big career and life shifts that impact their professional world. More than one-third (36%) have entirely changed their careers, switching to new industries and different roles. Although career pivoting is prevalent among 25-33 year olds, this may be more of a result of the changing workforce — LinkedIn data shows that job hopping overall has doubled in the last year, and more than two-thirds of job changers have pivoted careers. Nearly one-quarter (23%) have taken a career break during this period of uncertainty, taking time off from work to reevaluate what they want to do. One in ten have switched from full-time work to freelance or temporary work assignments. While there isn’t one simple solution to getting over a quarter-life crisis, getting advice from people that have had similar experiences can help when you’re at a crossroad in your career.  Our research found that people are looking for advice, but are unsure of where to turn. Although more than one-quarter (28%) of 25-33 year olds know what their dream job is, they’re unsure how to approach a career move. On top of that, 56% want advice to figure out what’s next, but don’t know where to go for answers. Forty-one percent feel they aren’t getting enough support at work to help them progress. Forty-three percent would like to find a career mentor but don’t have the right connections.

You’ll hear a range of answers, from our company vision to , which gives you a sense of what makes LinkedIn unique. For me, the answer is our annual day. Five years ago we created BIYP as a way for our employees to give their parents a glimpse into their professional lives as research suggested that one in three parents don’t actually know what their child does for a living. That first year we welcomed 1,400 parents. Since the start of the program, we’ve hosted more than 10,000 employees and parents for BIYP. This year we expect more than 4,000 parents to join us in 30 offices around the world to participate in activities organized by more than 250 employee volunteers. On BIYP parents get a chance to see how their kids spend their workdays – giving some context to conversations that typically happen over family dinners or get-togethers. For our employees, it’s a way to say thank you to the people that have supported them in countless ways through their personal and professional lives. This year BIYP falls on an InDay. This is the one day a month that we give back to our employees to invest in themselves, the company and the world. It’s a perfect day for our employees to share the projects they are most passionate about with some of the most important people in their lives. By giving our employees the chance to invest in themselves on a monthly basis, and introducing their family to their colleagues once a year, we create an opportunity learn a bit more about our co-workers and build a deeper feeling of belonging. BIYP isn’t just a LinkedIn program. It continues to grow each year and many companies around the globe have adopted it. So, if you’re lucky enough to be bringing your parents to work, be sure to share a short video or post of you and your loved ones on LinkedIn. Don’t worry, even if your parents aren’t able to participate this year, you can still share a video or post of your work and what you wish your parents knew about it. And don’t forget to join the conversation on social media using #BIYP!"},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Lists"],"author":"Blair Decembrele","title":"The LinkedIn Top Companies | Startups are Hiring Now","date":"November 2, 2017","content":"We launched the , a new extension of our annual Top Companies list which maps the most wanted companies by job seekers.

This is a win-win for recruiters and job-seekers alike, as interested candidates get contacted for relevant opportunities and recruiters can search a pool of job seekers looking for a new challenge. This has been — and will continue to be — a huge part of helping millions of our members connect with opportunity. The response we’ve seen since October 2016 is remarkable, and today we’re excited to share that more than 10 million LinkedIn members are currently open to new opportunities through their use of Open Candidates. Since its introduction, Open Candidates has driven incredible value for everyone using the feature, and the proof is in the data. For job-seekers, simply turning on your Open Candidates signal makes you twice as likely to receive relevant messages from recruiters, and for recruiters, Open Candidates are twice as likely to respond. In the last year, job seekers that have shown they are open to new opportunities have received many opportunities from recruiters to change their career. And this is only the beginning. We’re working hard to make the Open Candidates feature more effective. First, we’ve made it super easy to turn on your Open Candidates signal. On your LinkedIn profile you can now let recruiters know you’re open in the Career Interests section within (remember, only you can see this section and we never display that you’re an Open Candidate on your public profile!) Once you navigate to Career Interests, we’re now helping you get contacted for opportunities that fit exactly what you’re looking for. We ask you what specific job titles you’re open to, what cities you’d want to work in, and how soon you’re looking for your next opportunity. Tell us what your dream job is and we’ll make sure recruiters know about it. And that’s not all; on the horizon are a bunch of new features to make Open Candidates a one-stop shop for your job search. Coming soon are personalized suggestions to help you improve your profile, as well as unique insights on how much attention you’re getting from recruiters.

In fact, he still does. To this day, he’s clearly been able to suppress this fear while being successful, safe, and productive. This is largely due to a life chalk-full of experiences, several of which were spent facing risk and danger head-on, which helped foster his appreciation for the importance of rules. And, as someone that has had to follow dozens of steps just to wash their hands in space, Captain Whetherbee knows that rules have not only shaped him to be an accomplished employee, but a safe one too. However, while talking with us at our most recent Speaker Series event, Captain Whetherbee shared his belief that “rules aren’t what help you to face hazards, complete missions, and increase productivity. It’s actually the principles that you supplement those rules with, that makes them effective.” This thinking, he emphasized, is not only what has helped him find success, but is what can help others to do the same. Whether you’re in a conference room or a cockpit, the principles that Captain Whetherbee believes so passionately in aren’t exclusive to high risk, space-like environments. They are equally as important when approaching any normal day, which can in turn increase collaboration, productivity, and performance whether you’re at work, the office, gym, or anywhere inbetween. These are the principles that Captain Whetherbee shared with us: Above all else, your confidence shouldn’t exceed your humility. If this is to be true, then you will carry yourself confidently, but will also prioritize collaboration and input from others, without pushing blame when something does not go according to plan. Very closely correlated to the first principle, leaders and employees alike should constantly be evaluating themselves first. The upside is that everyone works better together, becomes more transparent and effective, and naturally challenges themselves to improve. The questions that Captain Whetherbee asks himself when confronting an issue is: Did set adequate requirements? Did provide sufficient resources, knowledge or training? Did exceed the team’s readiness? Always be evaluating risk, and where it may come from. This way, you’re constantly in a state of elevated awareness, which will help you minimize or avoid it. The best way to approach this principle is by: Searching for vulnerabilities based on existing knowledge (historical experience) Maintaining situational awareness (experience in the present moment) Anticipating changing risk (estimating what will present new risk) In many instances, mistakes, errors, and miscalculations are encountered as a result of not following the rules or procedures correctly, or by following them blindly. Rules are put in place to reduce risk, but it is on you to ensure that those rules are being followed smartly.

Sometimes we feel stuck. But it’s what Anna did to get unstuck that makes her story so inspiring, actionable and insightful for anyone considering a career shift. Specifically, Anna did three things to kickstart her new career as a software engineer: Anna leaned on her personal relationships and connections to help her explore a variety of career options. In time, she realized that a lot of the same logic-based skills she was developing to become a lawyer were transferrable to software engineering too. Whether it’s with a friend or lunch with a former coworker, talking to people who know you about your career search can open up possibilities and give you some helpful perspective. Don’t worry if you can’t do this in person. Sometimes, sending a to catch up or ask a few questions can be just as effective. In fact, we know that nearly one-third of professionals on LinkedIn have surfaced new opportunities through casual conversations they . Bottom line: it’s hard to predict who your connections know or all the ways they can conceivably offer help. Talk to them. Give them a chance to help and you may be surprised. The thing to remember about skills is that they’re like kitchen knives, over time they dull. It’s estimated that the . Anna knew she needed to learn new skills to successfully switch and chase a different type of career. Whether you need to do the same, or just want to sharpen your existing skills to stay ahead — there are a variety of ways to bulk up your professional know-how. While Anna chose to enroll in a multi-week coding bootcamp, learning a new skill doesn’t always require this same level of time and commitment. In fact, part of the appeal of online learning services like is that you can do everything online and pick up skills at your own pace, one lesson at a time. So whether you’re like Anna and learning new skills in order to jumpstart a career, or you simply want to be more , the more comfortable you can get with the notion of lifelong learning in your career, the better off you’ll be. After Anna graduated from her coding bootcamp, she used LinkedIn to help turbo-charge her job search efforts. She started by searching for companies that had a history of hiring people from coding bootcamps. Anna did this partly to get a better feel for the types of employers she might want to explore, and partly to start building a list of people who had been in her shoes and completed similar bootcamp programs. There are a few different ways to do this type of lookup on LinkedIn: Use the to find people who graduated from a particular school and sort the results by company. Using these features, Anna was able to quickly build a list of companies with different bootcamp graduates, and then she began to reach out to each person to introduce herself and gauge their willingness to talk more about their career. One of the graduates that responded quickly was Paulette. She was willing to provide some practical and timely advice, all of which eventually helped Anna land her first job and start a new career as a software engineer. There’s a lot we can learn from Anna’s story. She made a big decision and took the initiative to redirect her career, but it was the relationships she had and the new ones she formed that ultimately helped her find her way in to opportunity.

Whether it was Gordon Gekko ruling Wall Street or Jerry Maguire being shown the money, the idea of achieving success revolved around hitting the financial jackpot. Since then, the world has been redefined in every way possible. We watch all our shows when we want to without the need to tune in at a specific time, clouds now store our pictures rather than frames, and apps help us find new partners, hail cabs and connect us with our (once elusive) favourite celebrities. But is the same true for our definition of success – has that evolved too? New LinkedIn research in the UK reveals that more than a quarter of people (29 percent) think that traditional perceptions of success are outdated, and old status symbols like six figure salaries and fast cars are not the only way to define success. Rather, people are also valuing time for hobbies, work-life balance and starting a family. Like many things in life, success can take various forms and mean different things to everyone, whether that means spending most of your time as the CEO of a company, or the CEO of your family, and anything in-between. The fact of the matter is, more than one in four Brits (26 percent) admit they don’t feel successful, and more than a third (34 percent) told us they wish success was perceived as less important by society. That gave us an idea: If we opened up the conversation and explored the many different meanings of success, would this help people understand that success is in everyone, and that their own version is attainable? This question fuelled the launch of LinkedIn’s new campaign in the UK and Germany, #ThisIsSuccess, which aims to help our members and the wider workforce define success for themselves. Over the next few weeks we’ll be taking this message straight to the streets of London and Berlin, encouraging people to consider what success means to them. So, whether your version of success is making it back for bath time or having the time to play in your five-a-side football team, being your own boss or owning your own home, we encourage you to share and celebrate what it means to you. Join the conversation using #ThisIsSuccess."},{"post_categories":["Advance Your Career","Jobs"],"author":"Blair Decembrele","title":"Practical Tips for Finding The Way In: Claire’s Job Search Story","date":"October 9, 2017","content":"Claire was worried her dream job didn’t exist. For her, a dream job was one with an exciting role, cool technology and a just-right commute. Oh, and it needed to be a job that would make a big impact in the world. A tall order, right? But then she found it — all of it, at a company right in her backyard. If you’re thinking this was pure luck, think again. Here are 3 things Claire did that any job seeker can do today to help find their way in to a new opportunity: Sometimes people know exactly which company they’d like to work for, but Claire was less certain — until she read a story about a company called Wearsafe Labs in her local paper. Claire quickly jumped on LinkedIn to search for the company. It’s helpful to think of the as your shortcut to everything on LinkedIn, ranging from people and jobs, to companies and schools. And if you’re on your laptop, you can also use the to zero in on exactly what you need. Regardless of whether you’re on our laptop or your phone, when you look at a company page on LinkedIn, you might notice two important things: 1) If you’re already connected to someone who works at the company, this connection will show; and 2) if the company is hiring, you’ll see a button to view their job postings too. It turned out, Wearsafe was hiring. Claire’s big aha! moment struck when she noticed on LinkedIn that a former student she used to teach in her improv class knew someone at Wearsafe. Claire immediately reached out and asked her connection to help make an introduction. It’s hard to predict all the ways that people can help us find the way in to opportunity, which is why it’s important to regularly talk with your connections. Whether it’s simply leaving a comment on their latest LinkedIn article, or sending them a , or even taking it offline and . Sometimes it’s what people know that can make the difference, but often it’s who they know that can help us too. In fact, some shows that 70% of professionals got hired at a company with the help of a personal connection. Case in point: Claire had no idea a connection from her past would end up being able to make a big introduction to help her career, but that’s exactly what happened. When Claire’s friend introduced her to the CEO and founder of Wearsafe, Claire was able to quickly show her interest and passion, and equally important, her knowledge of the company and its leadership which helped her get a foot in the door for an interview. Claire had already been following Wearsafe on LinkedIn, so she had the advantage of being up to speed on the latest news and updates that were relevant to the business. She also used LinkedIn to familiarize herself with the people who worked at the company (including the leadership team) by looking at their LinkedIn profiles. There’s a lot of helpful information you can extract from someone’s LinkedIn profile including what they do, where they previously worked, who they know, and even where they went to school. It’s a great way to find common interests or shared experiences that you can later use to help warm up your interview conversations. Remember: those you’re speaking with may look at your profile too, so consider taking a few minutes to review and update your own information (and to help, we already have a ). Ultimately, using LinkedIn to research the company and the people who worked there helped to boost Claire’s confidence. And in an interview situation, your level of confidence can make all the difference. In fact, of interviewers say exuding confidence is more important than a degree from a top school. There’s a lot we can take and learn from Claire’s story. She thought finding a great job in her backyard was nearly impossible, you might too — but sometimes help and guidance can come from the most unlikely sources in your network to help you find the way in to your next great opportunity.

In the past few decades, it has gone from a niche exercise, to a full-blown lifestyle that millions have devoted their time, effort, and in some cases, life to. Regular mindfulness practice, even when done for a few minutes, can improve our ability to concentrate, remember, be present, learn, recover from stress, and stay resilient, among many other positive benefits. In turn, these effects can enhance our lived experiences, especially in the workplace. From enabling collaboration by developing listening skills, to helping us to stay on task by building focus, the positive impacts are countless in number. This comes as music to the ears of our latest Speaker Series guests, and Richard J. Davidson, who are both writers and researchers on psychological intelligence and wellbeing. Goleman and Davidson, whose prior research and written works have been credited with popularizing mindfulness training , shared the positive impacts that this practice can have on all of us, our relationships, and the many communities we belong to. Goleman and Davidson have watched the rapid influx of information and distraction that we as a society have willingly adopted. They’ve uncovered that people’s minds wander about 50% of the time naturally, and 90% of the time when actively stimulated, which is quite often given how many daily emails, meeting reminders, and messages we juggle alone. Also, that multi-tasking is really shifting attention rapidly, rather than focusing attention on multiple things at once. As a result, our attention spans, social connections, and basic human skills like empathy are all suffering. But, that doesn’t mean they can’t be developed and reinforced.

Now what? The initial excitement may wear off as nervous energy sets in. You may start to wonder: The good news is that some of the most common interview pitfalls that can distract potential employers from our strengths are super easy to avoid. Based on survey feedback we gathered from professionals across the U.S., we examined the results and identified five tips  to help you shine in your next interview: While it may be tempting to stretch the truth to impress, a job interview isn’t the place to fudge the facts. More than half (52%) of interviewers in the U.S. say they’ve turned down a candidate for lying about their previous work. Mastering the art of the may be our better bet. We have to try and share our accomplishments in a way that highlights our past experiences – what we’ve contributed, the results of our work and the value and impact we’ve made. One of the biggest potential interview mistakes may be sitting right there in the palm of your hands – more than one-third (35%) of interviewers have cut a candidate from consideration because they were distracted by their phone during the interview. Before heading into the interview, take the time to fully shut down your phone (not just silent!) and place it out of sight. Removing this potential disturbance is an easy step to help bring all of your attention and focus to the conversation. Always be ahead of the game — 3 out of 5 interviewers (63%) say they will pass on a candidate for arriving late, but it’s an easy thing to avoid. We need to build in ample buffer time for our commute and make it a point to arrive at least 10 minutes early. We may even want to do a practice run the day before to account for traffic and avoid any wrong turns. It’s important to remember that timing can be a delicate dance. If you arrive more than 15 minutes early, you can catch the interviewer off guard if they’re not ready for us. Instead, use this extra time in the car or a nearby coffee shop to take a breath and collect your thoughts and then arrive within the 15-minute window before the interview begins. Sealing the deal can depend on how you carry and present yourself during the interview. More than a quarter (26%) of interviewers say strong in a candidate is important — even more than a degree from a top school. Sitting up straight shows that we’re focused and paying attention. And slightly leaning forward singles a higher level of engagement in the conversation. Natural hand gestures are totally normal, but things like fidgeting, twirling hair or shaking our legs can detract from what we’re saying during the interview. matter. In fact, nearly half (46%) of interviewers have eliminated a candidate because of unprofessional attire. Don’t give an interviewer a reason to remember our attire for the wrong reasons. Even as more workplaces adopt casual dress codes, it remains important to be thoughtful about what we’re wearing. For women, a full pant-suit may not be necessary, but if you’re questioning the length of a skirt or graphic on a tee, chances are it’s best kept in the closet. For men, a tie may not be necessary, but you may want to leave the sneakers at home. Before the interview, take time to investigate by looking at the company’s LinkedIn page or other social media profiles to find photos of current employees to see what they’re wearing. And if you have a LinkedIn connection at the company, consider them to ask for their advice. Today, more than 34% of workers worldwide are seeking a new job. If you’re one of them, you have the power to set yourself up for success with these interview tips. Keep at it, remain confident and you’ll find #TheWayIn to your next opportunity."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Tips"],"author":"Julie Inouye","title":"Tuesday Tip: Using the Follow Hub to Discover Fresh Perspectives and Manage Your Followers ","date":"October 3, 2017","content":"If you’re interested in finding new perspectives to follow on LinkedIn, check out your Here you’ll find relevant recommendations on people, companies and publications to follow.

By studying and experiencing the progressive collapse of traditional institutions firsthand, Liu found his passion in education and empowerment. He discussed the breakdown of major political parties, the spontaneous growth of grassroots and bottom-up movements like Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street, and he spoke about the proverbial “door” that has opened allowing citizens of all types to amplify their voices and reclaim power from the governing elite.

Overall, the workforce in the United States sees an equal representation of gender, but data shows there is a disparity in the jobs women are hired for, and the associated compensation. We realize there are many factors that contribute to gender biases beyond what the data shows and how critical it is that we are all mindful of these factors as these biases can be powerful limitations to equality. To help shine a light on where some of these discrepancies exist, we took a look at LinkedIn’s member data: Men tend to include more information, , and have larger networks on LinkedIn than their female counterparts. Adding your location, additional skills and a robust summary to your LinkedIn profile will help you be found for more opportunities. On average, LinkedIn members with five or more skills receive up to 17X more profile views. You can also brush up on all of the , such as and , using . We have also created learning paths and courses to help you gain expertise on the most common skills among women in leadership positions. It may not come as a surprise that men and women are pursuing different types of careers. Over the past 12 months, LinkedIn member data shows women have applied for more roles in administrative, marketing, customer service, and human resource functions. On the other hand, among the top 10 most-applied-for roles for men and women, four of these jobs were the same: software engineer, project manager, business analyst, and account manager. Even more, there are jobs across industries and functions where closer gender parity exists in the hiring rate of men and women, including: program coordinator, quality assurance engineer, and research assistant, all of which see less than a 5% gender gap. Beyond the roles they are applying for, women are heavily underrepresented within leadership roles and among jobs in the highest paying industries in the United States, indicating that women are not always given the same opportunities to grow in their careers and maximize their earning potential. However, our . In the U.S., we saw an 8% change in women being hired into leadership positions between 2008 and 2016, especially within the education and nonprofit sectors. For decades, females have been overrepresented in the U.S. workforce for certain job roles, such as teaching, while being underrepresented in other more male-oriented jobs, such as construction (a phenomenon known as “ ”). There is a lot of debate about why this is the case, but the economic effects are clear: as occupations become more segregated by gender, female wages depress, the gender pay gap widens, and the economy becomes inefficient due to the lack of gender equality to opportunity. While we are making strides to encourage more women to enter traditionally male-dominated fields, there is still work to be done. One of the key aspects to closing the gender gap is to identify where we have made progress, tackle challenges to continue closing the hiring gap, and provide more opportunities for women.

Last week I got to do just that at our company all hands with the announcement that for the first time in ten years, LinkedIn is opening a new U.S. office in Detroit, Michigan.  Why Detroit? After evaluating more than 10 U.S. cities, we chose Detroit because we believe the Motor City presents a unique opportunity for LinkedIn to hire top talent and be a part of an exciting economic turnaround story. This new office gives us a chance to marry LinkedIn’s uniquely powerful culture with Detroit’s dynamic talent to create economic opportunity for our employees, the city and our company. At LinkedIn, we’re believers in not just talking the talk, but also walking the walk. For us, it means that if we say our vision is to create economic opportunity, then we need to actively invest in creating jobs in places where we know there is amazing talent. We recognize that often people don’t want to move to find a great job, so with our new Detroit office we’re bringing LinkedIn to a new city where we believe we’ll be able to hire great people. Now to the important questions — when will the new office open, where will it be and what types of talented people are we looking for?  We are in the final stages of identifying a temporary space downtown that will allow us to get operations up and running quickly as we work to find a future permanent office space in Detroit. Our goal is to have our first employees in that office within the next few months, and as such, we are actively searching for incredible sales professionals at all levels.

As LinkedIn ambassadors, we also encourage Campus Editors to rally their peers on campus to write about things that matter to them.

And today, we’re excited to say we’re accepting applications for our next class of Campus Editors. To sweeten the deal for this year’s Campus Editor class, each student will receive a Premium upgrade, giving them access to personalized information on LinkedIn, including job opportunities and much more.

I however, like many, have been lucky enough to consider this phrase only during moments of tribulation. The saying takes on a deeper meaning when pressed upon you by current USA Paralympian and Nike Athlete, Scout Bassett, who has made it her personal mantra. These themes of endurance and persistence are not limited to just her professional life, but they are reflected equally in her personal life’s journey, if not much, much more. This July, Scout, now an impassioned spokeswoman for the Challenged Athlete’s Foundation, took the time to share her awe-inspiring journey with us. From the heart-wrenching years in China where she lost her leg, all of the way through to the huge accomplishment of representing Team USA at Rio’s 2016 Paralympics, Scout is the model example of the pursuit of dreams against all odds. As you tune in, you will quickly learn that Scout’s humility regarding her racing accomplishments and academic achievements are not what she hopes to inspire everyone by.

In nine months, the team and I worked feverishly to launch that continue to deliver immense value to our 42 million (and growing) members in India. More importantly, they also have the potential to scale globally. Which is why I am excited that today, we are launching one of these products, LinkedIn Lite (mobile web and ) in more than 60 countries across the world including South Africa, the Philippines and Nigeria. The catalyst for LinkedIn Lite was a field research trip we went on about a year ago in Nashik, a small city about 100 miles from Mumbai. When we sat down to test the product with a few college students, my heart sank. We had worked on a new feature on the site, but that feature would not load because of the low level of internet connectivity in the area. That was a key moment for the team and me, as it dawned upon us that no matter how good your product is, all is lost if it won’t load for all audiences. Because of this and other similar experiences, we embarked on a journey to rewrite the linkedin.com mobile website with a core focus on speed and simplicity, and level the playing field for all our members when it comes to accessibility. We started with LinkedIn Lite mobile web which was rolled out to all Indian members earlier this year, and the impact has been quite remarkable. Not only does the site load 5 times faster, we’re also seeing that job applications on the mobile website have quadrupled since the launch of LinkedIn Lite in India. Additionally, more than half of our new members now sign up on mobile, so this has become a huge enabler for professionals in smaller cities in India to sign up and get connected. The Android mobile app was inspired by the success of LinkedIn Lite mobile web. Developed in just a couple of months, the app is less than one megabyte in size and can reduce data usage by as much as 80 percent in India, making LinkedIn easier to access than ever before, on any mobile device and in areas of low internet connectivity. It’s a lighter version of our Flagship app and includes all key features such as news feed, profile, networks, messaging, notifications, so our members can stay informed, get ahead in their careers and be more productive.

It’s important to present yourself in a way that highlights what makes you stand out as a professional. Whether it’s your first interview or your first day at your new job, here are some dos and don’ts to keep in mind: Think of your profile as your virtual handshake. Polishing your presence on LinkedIn can help guide recruiters and industry professionals to the best and brightest parts of your career and notable work experiences. And be sure to put your best foot forward – whether it’s in person or in your profile picture. In a recent LinkedIn survey*, nearly one-fifth (17%) of hiring managers say they have eliminated a candidate from consideration because of inappropriate photos online.

Finding a mutual connection within your LinkedIn network is an easy way to establish common ground during the interview. In a recent LinkedIn study, almost one-third (29%) of professionals say that a strong personal connection and easy conversation is one of the most important qualities they look for in a potential candidate. If you don’t have a mutual connection, don’t worry. You can check out the LinkedIn profiles of the people you are meeting with ahead of time to prepare. Familiarizing yourself with your interviewer – mentioning shared interests, mutual connections, or even their alma mater are great icebreakers. Timeliness is a timeless trait. One-fifth (21%) of professionals say that punctuality is key and one of their most important criteria for a candidate. Make sure you don’t get lost by researching your route to the interview the night before and create a backup plan in case of train delays, traffic, etc. It’s also never a bad idea to build in plenty of buffer time for your trip to the interview – if you get to the area well ahead of time, you can camp out in a coffee shop nearby to fit in a bit of final preparation. As a rule of thumb, show up to the interview 10-15 minutes early to start off on the right foot. Keep these dos and don’ts in mind, and you’ll be sure to leave a great first impression with anyone you meet in the job hunting process. By keeping your online presence polished, building rapport with your interviewer and being respectful, you’ll set yourself up to find your way into your next career opportunity, and the right job for you."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Marketing Solutions"],"author":"Alexandra Rynne","title":"Announcing LinkedIn’s Top 10 Company Pages of 2017","date":"July 27, 2017","content":"Last week, we asked you to nominate the businesses and organizations that impressed you most on LinkedIn this past year.

By 2020, they’ll grow to represent more than 50% of the workforce. Much has been written about this generation’s defining traits: purpose-driven, digitally-savvy, and extremely well-connected. But how connected are they really? To understand professional networking behaviors, we conducted a survey among thousands of our members worldwide, including more than 7,000 millennials. Here’s what we discovered about the way millennials network (or don’t!), and what’s holding them back from reaching out to their contacts to progress their careers. Like their parents and grandparents before them, millennials recognize the with their professional network: 71% of agree that it’s an effective way to build and nurture relationships. Regardless, they find it more challenging than older generations to stay in touch: 43% of millennials find it difficult, compared to 31% of those older than 45. So what’s holding millennials back? Interestingly, our data shows completely contrasting generational views. For all their perceived social prowess on and offline, their biggest challenges were not knowing what to say and uncertainty around how to get in touch. And despite living fast-paced lives, a lack of time was the least of millennials’ worries, while their older counterparts said it was their biggest challenge. Despite the barriers, more than half (55%) of millennials reach out to their network when they’re starting to think about their next opportunity. When they do tap their connections, many are rewarded: 56% of millennials were introduced to a new job through a casual conversation. Not bad for a shy bunch! If you haven’t been in touch with someone in a long time, refresh their memory of when and where you connected. If possible, mention something you have in common, like if you went to the same university or worked at the same company. And if you don’t know who to reach out to, we make it easy for you.

He is a college dropout, the former director of marketing for American Apparel, a five-time author, and now lives on a ranch outside of Austin, Texas, where he writes “in between raising cattle, donkeys, and goats.” It’s a path that didn’t come without reflection and insight. Holiday joined us for the latest LinkedIn Speaker Series and spoke about his new book, and what we can do to combat the catastrophic results when we let ego take over. Through historical anecdotes, research, and observation, Holiday sees life as one of three, cyclical stages: aspiring, succeeding, or failing. And no matter what stage you’re in, ego can affect them all. The first way to combat ego is early on, when you’re in the “aspire” stage, and one way you prevent ego from taking the wheel is to not only adopt a student mindset, but never let it go. In quoting Epictetus, “It's impossible for a person to learn that which they think they already know.” Holiday reminds us that when you think you know everything, in some ways you are right, because you don't learn anything more. Commit to learning from people who are better than you, challenge yourself against someone as good as you, and pass on these lessons to someone not as good as you. It’s this student mindset that can keep ego at bay. Eventually in life, you’ll come to a point where you’ve done it. You’ve made it to the top of the mountain and success tastes sweet. But there’s danger in this early pride and the focus on amassing attention and accolades. Holiday recognizes that in the beginning of our career, there’s a need to  make a name for yourself, but if you give in too much, it will divert you from where you really want to go. Instead, focus on the work and let it do the talking for you. And as much as we try to avoid it, failure is certain. But that’s just the thing: everyone fails. Instead of measuring yourself by how you think others measure you, create your own inner scorecard and measure yourself by what you think success and failure looks like. What matters is that you are not indifferent to what you've accomplished, but that you know that what you did was the best you could have done at that moment. This is the stronger measurement of success and failure. Throughout his talk, Holiday reminds us that ego is a short-term solution that creates long-term problems, and shifting your mindset throughout these three phases of life can help prevent ego-driven outcomes.

Hiring across the U.S. was 16.7% higher in April than April 2016. And seasonally-adjusted hiring (hiring that excludes seasonal hiring variations – like companies hiring less in December due to the holiday season) was 3.4% higher in April than March. That’s according to our . That made the strongest month for hiring since June 2015. If you’re looking for a new gig, check out LinkedIn Jobs! But there’s a potential bump in the road worth calling out: despite the increase in hiring last month, seasonally-adjusted hiring was down in April compared to March in 10 of the 13 industries we track on LinkedIn. That means the nationwide increase in seasonally-adjusted hiring was fueled by only three industries – the manufacturing and industrial industry (which was up 0.5%); the aerospace, automotive, and transport industry (which was up 1.3%), and the software industry (which was up 8.5%). There’s no cause for concern now since it’s only one month’s worth of data. But if it persists, it could be a challenge because it’s like having an NBA playoff team with two all stars. If one gets hurt, the entire team’s performance will drop. And there’s one other interesting finding from this month’s Workforce Report: Demand for manufacturing skills is strong, but not in the Midwestern cities once the hotbed for American factory jobs. There are too many workers skilled in lean manufacturing and quality management in Cleveland, Detroit, and Minneapolis, for example. But there aren’t enough workers with that skill in faster-growing coastal (and one inland) cities – like Washington, D.C., the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, Miami, Los Angeles, and Denver.

Unlike race or gender, disabilities are not always something that can be seen by the naked eye, which may be why they are often overlooked or absent in conversations around diversity and inclusion in the workplace, and more broadly, in the digital world.

But for millions of people that simple action can become complicated if the individual in question can’t see, hear, physically navigate, or cognitively make sense of the website or mobile app in front of them.

Jennison is widely respected for his work within the accessibility community and at LinkedIn, and his perspective has inspired many, including me to get involved in accessibility efforts both in and outside of LinkedIn. : Digital accessibility is about designing and developing experiences so that they can be independently used by everyone, including people who happen to have a disability or impairment. It’s not only about developing solutions at the code level (although that’s a big piece of it), it’s also about embedding accessibility throughout the design and all other product development processes. A huge part of it is strategically and deliberately thinking of ways to make it a part of your culture and values, so it’s at the forefront of everything you do, and not something treated as a nice-to-have weeks before a launch. As someone who is blind and who works in digital accessibility, I need to stress that accessibility is not exclusively about addressing the needs of the visually impaired. The work aims to address every disability or impairment you can think of including, but not limited to: auditory, visual, speech, physical and cognitive disabilities. I am a beneficiary and advocate for digital access and inclusion. However, If I’m only advocating for blindness-related issues, then I’m not doing my job. In addition to those who have disabilities, there are also individuals impacted by temporary disabilities. For example, someone who has seriously injured their arm may temporarily need to rely on technology such as voice recognition software to send emails for work until they are healed. For the non-disabled, it’s sometimes a personal preference and provides flexibility. Many accessibility solutions were created for the disabled, but the solutions have become useful for all. Think about the times when you’ve tabbed through a site instead of scrolling or using the mouse or relied on closed captioning to watch TV either out of necessity or preference. Both are examples of a benefit of digital accessibility work and how it can benefit us all. Examples of digital accessibility include: assuring that all actions you can perform with a mouse can be accomplished using the keyboard alone, adding an asterisk (*) to accompany red that may be used to indicate which fields are required, making sure there are sufficient foreground and background color contrast, and provide transcripts/captioning for video content for people who are deaf/hard of hearing. In 2012, I was planning to attend a conference on technology for people with disabilities and reached out to LinkedIn to see if they would be interested in seeing what it was like to use their site using a screen reader. They took me up on it. A few months later, they asked if I would be interested in moving from Toronto to lead their accessibility efforts. At that point, LinkedIn had an accessibility task force committed to making the site accessible, but it was a percentage of people’s time. When I came on board it became 100% of my focus, and I was able to form a team of software engineers who are 100% dedicated to digital accessibility. Three things come to mind: First, having our team involved in the new LinkedIn desktop redesign from the beginning. It wasn’t an exercise in course correcting, we were embedded with the engineering team from the start. Second, our collective efforts, specifically your work, Renato, in making the LinkedIn Android App that much more digitally accessible. You’ve really become the subject matter expert and before this neither Android or accessibility were your focus! And last but not least, being able to expose and teach engineers and designers, many of whom are early in their careers, about accessibility makes it more likely inclusion will become a natural part of the way they design and build products going forward. Having this opportunity makes my job, without question, that much more meaningful. My goal is to continue generating interest in digital accessibility, as a set of skills and a mindset worth pursuing because it is a rare opportunity to truly make an impact in the lives of people around the world. If you’re reading this and wondering how you can get involved or learn more -- I’d recommend something as simple as visiting your favorite website and trying to navigate it with the keyboard alone, no mouse. If it doesn’t work, take a few moments to reach out and let them know their site is not accessible. Once you are aware of digital accessibility, it makes an impact, and it’s not something you will easily forget!

It’s not surprising as conversations are at the heart of unlocking opportunities such as a new job, business lead or career advice. That’s why we’re rolling out an even smarter messaging experience with the ability to message a connection from wherever you may be on LinkedIn, along with suggestions that can help connect you to a new job. We’ve made messaging easier to use and more accessible from anywhere on the LinkedIn desktop experience. Whether you’re reconnecting with a former colleague, searching for a job, or looking for a potential candidate, you now have the ability to start an instant conversation. This means that you’ll never lose context when reaching out to your network. For example, you can have a conversation with a connection without ever leaving their profile, or reach out to someone directly from the LinkedIn Feed. One of the best ways to get connected to a new opportunity is through your network. In fact, nearly 50% of LinkedIn members have found a job through a mutual connection. To make your job search even easier, we’ve added relevant suggestions within messaging on the Jobs and Company pages to help you start a conversation. For example, when looking at a job posting at a company you’re interested in we’ll show you which of your connections work there, or who can introduce you to someone at the company. If you’re responding to a message, we’ve also made it easier for you to reply quickly with one simple tap on mobile. For example, “Thanks” and “I’ll get back to you.” Conversations help you build relationships that can ultimately make the difference in getting you to your next opportunity -- whether that’s a new job, a new client or the chance to speak at an industry event.

We are committed to creating a more gender-inclusive world, and believe that data can help us think critically about the current state of the professional gender gap, and how to close it. We analyzed millions of LinkedIn profiles to see the industries, job titles and countries where women are thriving, and to help identify barriers the global workforce still needs to overcome. Since 2008, more women have been hired into leadership positions around the world. While there is still a gap, we are seeing significant strides, and women in leadership now hold an average of just over 25% of all leadership positions globally. Our data shows that India, which has historically lagged in hiring women into leadership positions, has gained significant momentum with the largest percentage increase being hired into leadership roles (25%). Out of the 10 countries in our analysis Canada, the United States and France have the highest percentage of women in leadership, with an average of one third of women holding leadership roles director-level and above. The is leading the way in closing the gap between male and female leaders. In this sector, women are being hired for 47% of leadership positions. also has a high number of women in leadership with 40% of women being hired into leadership positions. It may come as a surprise that the technology industry saw the largest change with a 18% increase in female leaders hired. Conversely, the oil and energy industry reduced its hiring of women leaders by 5%. In the C-suite, the single role that women hold more than or equivalent to men is Chief Human Resource Officer (56%, which is an increase of 82% since 2008). In contrast, women CEOs still make up only 18% of the workforce. At the director-level, hiring for women in the Director of Information Technology role has increased by 57% since 2008. We also evaluated the roles women were being hired into overall. Interestingly, women being hired into is on the rise. The top three job titles that have seen the strongest growth are all technology roles: (67% increase), (60% increase) and (40% increase). To determine attributes of women leaders, we also looked at the most common skills based on LinkedIn profiles. Management and leadership top the list of skills for women in leadership positions. Interestingly, customer service and public speaking also ranked highly. You can brush up on all of these skills on . We’ve also created learning paths and courses to help you gain expertise on the most common skills among women in leadership positions. Our data shows that diversity and inclusion is becoming a priority for companies worldwide. that diversity will be the number one trend defining the future of hiring. Furthermore, our data shows there has been a 35% increase in global hires made with diversity job titles over the past eight years. This could reflect an increased emphasis from business leaders looking to close the gender gap, particularly at the senior levels. While companies have made strides globally in bridging the gender gap in the workplace, there is still a lot of work to be done. One of the key aspects to closing the gender gap is to identify where we’ve made progress, tackle obstacles to close the leadership gap, and provide resources to help create leadership paths for women.

Freelancers who made up a mere 6% of the workforce in 1989 are expected to represent 43% of the workforce by 2020. This meteoric rise of the freelance workforce can be traced to a number of compounding economic and workforce factors emerging over the past several decades: The average duration of unemployment in America has from 8.5 weeks in 1980, to 12 weeks in 2000, to 25.1 weeks today. The number of full-time workers at U.S. private sector firms enrolled in defined benefit pension plans from 60% in 1982 to a mere 14% today, equating to a decrease in retirement savings for many. The median family income from 2000 to 2012. In contrast, during that same period, the average price of rent .  that recent developments in machine learning will put as much as 47% of American jobs at risk within the next two decades. Enter the gig economy. Combining data gleaned from our professionals* with that of our friends at Intuit** we’ve discovered how, in the face of these broader shifts, the on-demand economy is shaping a new generation of professional. Given the economic uncertainties faced by many, it should come as no surprise that the top reason people choose to work with an on-demand platform is to earn more money (57%). In fact, 66% of gig workers report having highly variable incomes, so supplemental freelance work is enabling them to establish more consistency and stability in their finances. Other top motivators among professionals taking the leap in to gig work include work-life balance, the departure from a traditional 9-to-5 work schedule, and autonomy. On-demand platforms enable professionals to more quickly and easily supplement their traditional day jobs, shifting the “professional norm” in ways few could have predicted. Our data evidences this dynamic with 41% of on-demand workers having either a traditional full-time job (27%) or part-time job (14%), in addition to their on-demand work. Only 5% of on-demand workers work exclusively for a single gig provider. This further reinforces we’ve been watching and reporting on over the past few quarters. As we delve into the data, we’re able to see more specifically which professionals are paving the way for this new era of work: We’re also happy to report that the extra income, improved work-life balance, and control over work and scheduling leads to a pretty satisfied workforce. In fact, 67% of on-demand professionals are Highly Satisfied or Satisfied with their work. The gig economy has taken hold and we can only expect this shift in the workforce to become more pronounced with time. Our data shows that 81% of on-demand workers plan to continue working in the gig economy. Of those, 47% plan to increase their freelance hours.

So it was only fitting that in celebration of Black History Month, our Black Inclusion Group hosted an all Black executive roundtable, in partnership with s Black Professional Network, on ‘The Business of Belonging.’ The evening featured a thought-provoking panel discussion on what it means to belong and some of the challenges faced by Black professionals in the workplace. My hope is that the stories that we shared will help others remove their masks and unleash their full potential. I was fortunate to be a member of the panel this year along with , CFO of Aimmune Therapeutics, , Chief Compliance Officer, Wells Fargo and , Founder and CEO Ujama Inc. The discussion focused on Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (DIBs), but more specifically belonging in the workplace. Panelists were asked to share what belonging means to them, and to share examples of when they felt like they did or didn’t belong. Here at LinkedIn, I am fortunate to regularly have meaningful discussions around DIBs and in particular belonging, but in my career that has not always been the case. There were two key events in my career that shifted my experience of belonging. In 1988 I graduated from the University of Kansas believing that I was unstoppable and that the world would be full of possibilities. I accepted a position as a claims adjuster for a top company, where I was later informed that the entire team which was predominately Black was hired to increase representation. I loved my new job and I was excited to learn and grow. A few months after I joined, my supervisor called a meeting with only the Black members of our team and said, “you guys have to stop congregating and using colloquialisms because you are making these White folks uncomfortable.” I was shocked and it was at that moment the message was clear you don’t belong and you don’t matter. That was the first day I began wearing “the mask,” showing up to work suppressing my authentic self in order to fit in. In 2010, I was working for a great company in Silicon Valley and was asked by one of the vice presidents I supported to give feedback on how she showed up in her staff meeting. Her style was abrasive and her team was not engaged, so I had to figure out how to deliver the feedback. As an HR professional, part of my role includes coaching and leadership development. Since I was still wearing “the mask,” I packaged all my comments with a neat bow so as not to offend her because I was afraid that if I told her the truth and shared my thoughts, it would not be received well. The messages from my first job were still shaping how I showed up in my current job, that I didn’t matter or belong, therefore my opinions didn’t either. The following weekend I attended a workshop that a dear friend had been encouraging me to attend for some time. The workshop was focused on how to get breakthrough results in your life by figuring out what was really holding you back. In the workshop, I realized that I had let that one message from my past drive my future choices and that was not serving me. In that very moment, I made a different choice to take “the mask” off and be my authentic self. On Monday when I went back to the office, I immediately set up time with the VP in order to give her the feedback she deserved, so she would be in the position to grow and improve. She was grateful and asked me to always give it to her straight and that my feedback and point of view were important because she trusted me and valued my expertise. Until that point, I felt like I had a successful career but I never felt free to be me. For me, belonging means you see me (the authentic me) and I matter. Since that day I have never worn “the mask,” again and my career has been much more fulfilling as a result. During the EY Black History Month Executive Roundtable, I was moved to find out that so many others felt they had to wear “the mask” in their workplaces. The topic of belonging is so important as it can affect employees in so many ways. Events like this are important as they allow black professionals the opportunity to network with others who have similar experiences. Yvette Hollingsworth Clark said, “I may have been the only one in the room, but I needed to be there to help others.” The overwhelming opinion of the panel was that creating a space to have an open dialogue is always a good thing. There are so many feedback cues that employees will use to determine if they belong: Do I matter? Is my opinion valued? Can I be my authentic self? Will I be accepted? At LinkedIn, we have added a DIBs index to our Employee Voice Survey (EVS). We want to ensure that employees feel they belong and if they don’t we have a way for them to let us know. Just imagine what could happen if all employees in all companies felt like they belonged. This would unleash their full potential, and they'd all feel empowered to create an environment where everyone feels like they belong. This could be the start of creating a culture of belonging. #StartSomething"},{"post_categories":["Jobs"],"author":"Andrew Ku","title":"Rock Your Next Interview: Mastering Behavioral Interview Questions","date":"March 1, 2017","content":"Behavioral interview questions are the “Tell me about a time...” questions. They prompt you to talk about your past experiences so you can demonstrate you have particular skills. Demonstrating you have these “soft” skills is incredibly important to proving you’re the right candidate for the job, but the questions can be tricky. Here’s what hiring managers had to say about behavioral interview questions during a recent survey*: Behavioral interview questions can be the toughest part of the interview and top the list for what hiring managers use to evaluate soft skills. Often, they’re looking for skills such as teamwork, leadership, and time management. More than 60% of hiring managers say that soft skills are critical but tough to find. These two findings are just the tip of the iceberg. To help you get ready for your next interview, we unearthed the questions hiring managers love to ask so you can be prepared. Hiring managers report that these are the top three soft skills they look for in candidates, and why they’re important: 69% of hiring managers say adaptability is the most important soft skill they screen for. By screening for this trait, hiring managers aim to empower team members to solve problems, and adapt to changing situations within the organization. 89% of hiring failures are due to a poor culture fit, which impacts both the employee and the organization. However, with the right culture fit, employees can thrive in a new work environment. 97% of employees and executives believe that a lack of collaboration and team alignment directly impacts the outcome of a task or project. Diverse teams that work together are more likely to come up with novel solutions and, as with culture fit, are more likely to succeed within an organization. Take a closer . We also outline a simple framework you can use to help you nail each answer by digging deep into the specifics of a situation to give the hiring manager an understanding of your thought process and motivation.

Over the course of their careers, they establish principles that are core to the way they approach their roles. For LinkedIn’s CEO Jeff Weiner, these principles start with compassionate management. While some may misconstrue compassion as softness or malleability, he argues that truly unconditional compassion can actually require superhero strength. It’s an ideal that challenges one’s confidence, sense of self, and commitment to a vision despite internal doubts and external criticism. Launching today, Jeff’s second LinkedIn Learning course, , teaches viewers what it means to “aspire to manage compassionately.” He describes it as a constant work in progress as compassion is not conditional. This approach will inevitably be easier when managing employees with similar perspectives, however, it needs to be extended to everyone from the top down in an organization to truly drive long-term value. Jeff also shares his own journey of learning to manage compassionately. He describes how experiences with his own managers early in his career helped shape the leadership style he embodies today. He is mindful of putting himself in the shoes of his team members to better understand what they’re trying to accomplish and what it is that triggers their vulnerabilities or insecurities. He also takes opportunities to coach his team where he can. With this approach, he has been able to build a foundational trust with his team and within the organization, which is crucial for scaling a business. “At the end of the day, I think one of the most important drivers of long-term value within an organization is the speed and quality of its decision-making. When you cultivate trust, when you cultivate compassionate management, you put yourself and your team in a position where you can be making high quality decisions faster.” We’re excited to provide a second opportunity for members to learn directly from one of today’s most respected leaders.

The best of those companies grow into the brands we all admire, but the journey from startup to market leader is not for the faint of heart, and for those who have succeeded, there are many more who have failed. Anyone building a business from the ground up, taking the helm of an existing organization, or dreaming of doing both, can benefit from the experience of others who have done it. Starting this week, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner’s first ever LinkedIn Learning course launches. Jeff joined LinkedIn in December 2008, and under his leadership, LinkedIn has grown its membership from 33 million to more than 467 million, increased its annual revenue from $78 million to $3.7 billion, and gone from 338 employees to more than 10,000 full-time employees in more than 30 offices around the world. His first course, , focuses on how to establish a culture within an organization and how to effectively plan for scaling. This course, which was originally filmed during an interview with Reid Hoffman at Stanford University, is now available for free to all learners. In this 45 minute course, Jeff describes what it was like to join LinkedIn, his initial observations and how he dedicated his first hundred days to getting to know the people and the product. Rather than develop a stringent 100 day plan, he used this time to listen and to learn from the people who knew the company best. He describes this period of listening as invaluable in helping him to shape and define a vision and mission for the business that embraced the collective personality of the organization and its aspirations. This definitive vision and mission also enabled Jeff to incite excitement and establish a stronger sense of culture among employees. He describes aspiration as being a critical component of company culture and because LinkedIn employees’ collective aspirations helped drive the company mission and vision, the culture and defining values of the company were then widely embraced. His thoughts on leadership, coaching, and hiring and retaining top talent are also integral parts of the principles he puts forth for establishing a culture and a plan for scaling. It remains clear, however, that these components are all built on the foundation created from his listen-first approach. We believe learning this kind of real-world expertise from industry leaders shouldn’t be relegated solely to those with access to an Ivy League education.

Top of the list, and new to the top 10 this year, is the term “Specialized,” knocking “Leadership” out of the top slot from 2016 and falling to second. “Passionate” moves up one place to become the third most overused buzzword worldwide. “Strategic” and “Experienced” complete the top five; the latter a new entry to the top 10. If these words do little to communicate why we’re good at our jobs, why is the world using them? We partnered with best-selling biographer to look at why people are still using language that makes them blend into the background rather than get noticed.

Now, emojis are finding their way into the workplace. Many companies are using emojis to connect with their audience - we even spotted a this week. It helps that emojis are becoming more career-friendly by the day — Apple’s feature a suite of new professions for women. While you may not think twice about using emojis with friends, it can be difficult to figure out the protocol for using emojis when messaging your boss, colleagues or clients. Let’s break down the do’s and don’ts for using emojis in the workplace. Every workplace is unique, so it’s important to understand the culture in your office to determine if it’s appropriate to use emojis. Take cues from others who are more senior than you. And if you’re the boss, understand that your approach sets the tone for others. If you’re speaking with a new colleague or a potential client, it’s best to skip it. You’ll come across more professional and avoid miscommunication. Emoji usage can also depend on the industry you work in. If you’re in a creative field or in the digital communication space, it may make sense to use emojis more than someone in a field like finance or law. A good rule of thumb is to treat emojis at work like exclamation points – best if used sparingly to avoid muddling your message. If you’re having an important conversation, it may be inappropriate to use emojis as you may give off the impression to others that you aren’t taking it seriously. Be conscious about the different platforms for communication in your office. You may find that emojis are more than acceptable on the team’s instant messaging channels, but with email, your company takes a more professional tone. Don’t use an emoji if you aren’t absolutely certain what it represents and how it will be received. Some symbols can be taken the wrong way or have multiple meanings. When in doubt, rely on words to get your point across. With so much communication taking place via email and messaging, using emojis can help boost team morale and office culture, but make sure to always stay professional. When it comes to workplace interactions, it’s best to show up professionally. Ultimately, whether emojis are an acceptable form of workplace communication comes down to your company’s culture, industry, and your personality. Take time to get to know your team, your clients and your superiors so you can effectively communicate and showcase a professional brand you’re proud of."},{"post_categories":["Jobs"],"author":"Ryan Sandler","title":"The Jobs and Industries With the Biggest Bonuses in 2016","date":"December 19, 2016","content":"This time of year when extra expenses come in the form of gifts and holiday events, understanding job compensation is important.

A key reason we believe LinkedIn has been successful is that part of that culture involves encouraging our teams to take intelligent risks. Recently my team took a risk that reinforced for current employees what makes LinkedIn such a unique place to work and helped us bring that to life for potential employees as well. Typical recruiting events follow a pretty standard formula: Invite talent to an open house event, talk about the company culture, mission, vision, products and specific roles, then have attendees network with hiring managers and recruiters. , it works pretty well. But, it should come as no surprise then that if you don’t mix up the strategy, you won’t see different results. With this particular open house, we wanted to attract Black and Latino sales professionals. We knew if we wanted to really connect with this audience and pull off a successful event that left people talking, we’d have to take a fresh approach. Enter the “big” idea: LinkedIn would host an open mic event to give people a chance to be their authentic selves in an environment normally reserved for formal business conversations. Our goal was to give attendees a sense of belonging they’d likely never felt at a networking event before. This brings us back to intelligent risk. Live performances can be unpredictable -- people get caught up in the moment, views or language shared may not always resonate with everyone in the crowd. It can also be a challenge to get candidates who are not actively looking for a new role to take time out of their day to attend any kind of recruiting event. But we knew the upside would be huge -- and if it didn’t work we’d learn and iterate. To make sure we approached this in the right way we partnered with members of our Black and Latino Employee Resource Groups on the global sales team. We knew they would be advocates and partners who would be critical to the success of the event itself. Taking the risk paid off. In November, we hosted our first ever open mic event geared towards building relationships with talented individuals referred by our Black and Latino employees. Nearly 100 Black and Latino sales professionals networked with hiring managers, recruiters and employees. The open mic line-up included performances from LinkedIn employees, external performers and a few brave guests. After a solid hour of performances that brought people to their feet, the night transitioned to more traditional networking. The performances, hiring managers and attendees, were excited, relaxed and eager to network. In this instance, taking a risk paid off. An unprecedented 96% of attendees told us they’d recommend this event to a friend. This year, we are looking forward to expanding and iterating on this idea as well as welcoming several new team members who will be joining us in the near future as a result of the strong sense of belonging they felt at the open mic night. What big ideas will you pursue this year? It’s 2017.

Here are steps you can take to start writing on LinkedIn now—and just maybe we’ll see you on the list next year. Plumb your professional world to come up with topics. What tricks do you employ every day that make your work life easier? What failures have you had along the way that helped turn you into a success? What inspired you to do what you do? Use the details from your life to help others be better in theirs. This approach has been wildly successful for many of our Top Voices, such as ’s takedown of the from her experience as a cancer patient or ’s struggle (and eventual successes) after getting or ’s decision to to become an independent consultant. Readers are looking for timely content that’s relevant to them today. The more you offer your take on what’s happening today, the more of an impact you’ll have. Many of our standout Top Voices articles this year came in direct response to events that were taking over headlines: topics like , , the insensitive language Macy’s used to announce or discussions of . In order to keep an audience engaged, shorter and frequent is better than long-winded and sporadic.

Don't wait for perfect, and don’t feel like you need to write the next great American article. On average, articles by Top Voices writers were just over 800 words. A great headline carries a lot of weight: It can draw in readers who might otherwise skim and move on; it can help keep you focused while you're writing (some writers will come up with the headline first before writing a word of the article); it can give search engines valuable information. One rule to remember: Clear beats clever; use puns, jokes and numbers sparingly. And don't try to trick people by offering a headline that doesn't pay off in the text; there's no better way to anger your readers and stop them from coming back. Write to start a conversation instead of to collect pageviews. The real power — and one of the things that really sets LinkedIn apart — is in the quality of the comments. You get feedback and engagement from real, non-anonymous professionals across the globe. As two-time Top Voices honoree says, “If a stranger likes my writing enough to write a note about it and share their thoughts, that’s the pinnacle of external engagement.” Share the pieces widely with your own network and across social — Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, whatever is right for your audience — and respond to other members in the comments.

It’s a simple enough question, but one whose answer seems to evade so many. In fact, the quest for happiness has turned into a burgeoning industry full of books, coaches, and even full-time positions at the most progressive companies. The research is also plentiful. People who are happier or have a positive mindset at work are 31% more productive, 40% more likely to get a promotion in the next 12 months, and three times more creative. And to top it off, happier people live longer. “Sign me up!” we quickly proclaim. “Let’s get happy!” However, despite our best intentions, people are still searching for happiness.

They are veterans of the United States military. There is a strong business case for hiring veterans, not only for their and , but also their growth potential. Veterans have a demonstrated propensity for leadership, team building, critical thinking, and the ability to assess problems and make decisions in difficult and dynamic environments. So it should be no surprise that they are rising to the highest ranks in America’s top companies. At LinkedIn, our research team took a deep dive on executive veterans to learn more about their paths to the top. We wondered what specifically is driving their success and what can other veterans can do today to rise in their companies? Here’s what we discovered: Currently there are 186,000 veterans on LinkedIn who hold executive-level positions (director and above). Out of that population, 28% work at larger companies (those with more than 1,000 employees). When considering companies to work for, veterans entering the civilian workforce appear more likely to succeed in larger companies when pursuing executive-level roles. Veterans pursuing occupations in finance and engineering had the highest likelihood of reaching director-level positions and above at companies with more than 1,000 employees. In a previous , we found that veterans excel in engineering, coding, security and software skills compared to the average LinkedIn member. The combination of veterans’ leadership and team building skills with their high likelihood for technical skills creates a recipe for success. For veterans in non-technical, more combat-oriented roles, our LinkedIn Learning platform has a host of courses to get you started (and you can get free access via our ). Fortunately, there are thousands of openings when it comes to the first jobs executive level veterans had when they left the military. Check out the job openings below: Top Springboard Job for Vets Open Jobs (U.S.) Salary (U.S. Median) 3,600+ 2,700+ 3,600+ 1,400+ 1,800+ While reflects that government is one of the top three industries for employing veterans, the majority of veterans are spread across a wide range of industries. Government, however, is not the top industry for those veterans seeking to reach executive status. In fact, veterans who currently hold influential executive positions are 1.5X as likely to be working in the Financial Services and Insurance industry compared to all veterans. There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to veterans achieving executive level status, but there are some things that the leaders represented on LinkedIn have done to increase the likelihood.

Unfortunately, when the average citizen meets a veteran, they are likely meeting an unfamiliar face. With less than one percent of our population serving in these most recent conflicts, and with our nation defended by an all volunteer force, a growing cultural divide between those who protect and those protected raises the specter of misperceptions which can heighten the challenges some veterans face when pursuing their next steps. But today’s veterans are civic assets. They’re starting businesses, running for office, and taking on leadership roles in their communities. And like the great generations who’ve gone before them, they’re poised to lift our country to new heights. They deserve our investment far more than just our thanks.

When we first launched Bring In Your Parents Day in 2013, the intention was to help bridge the gap between parents and their children so that parents could impart wisdom to help their children’s career. But something happened that we didn’t expect; it became a day filled with emotion and gratitude. Yes, it’s funny that our parents often have no clue what we do, and I still chuckle about my mother’s confusion around why our CEO doesn’t wear a suit. But when I met my team’s parents, looked them in the eye and thanked them for raising such amazing people and colleagues, the day took on a very different meaning. Whether they were learning about our company or meeting their child’s boss, pride was evident on every parent’s face and it was contagious. It’s no surprise that more than three quarters of parents say they are “very proud” of their children, according to our recent global survey. Parents point to their children graduating as the proudest life moment for most (44 percent), followed by their child’s first job (42 percent) and first steps (37 percent). What came as a bit of a surprise was that verbal praise lessens as we get older. We found that 45 percent of parents couldn’t remember the last time they told their children they were proud of them. Is this because we don’t tell our parents enough about what we do for a living? While 17 percent considered their children to be too old for praise, a further 10 percent attributed the lack of praise to a lack of understanding of their child’s job and what they do day-to-day. To celebrate this year’s Bring In Your Parents Day, we asked a variety of parents and children just what pride means to them.

Without that feeling of belonging, to truly be your unique self, a company cannot unleash the magic of a diverse team. That is the goal. But to understand the journey - numbers still matter. With that said, representation as of June 2016 is as follows: at LinkedIn, women account for 42% of overall employees and 35% of leadership - a 5% improvement since 2015 and a 10% improvement since 2014. Three percent of our employees are Black and 5% are Latino. We will continue to strive to do better. In 2016, we conducted a survey of our US employees to give them the opportunity to self-identify across several key measures of diversity such as gender and ethnicity. Data from this survey is included in this report. This survey also gave our employees the ability to anonymously disclose if they identify as having a disability.

Our Talent Acquisition goal is to build a robust, diverse and inclusive applicant pool and create the conditions internally to get them through an unbiased process. In May 2016, our recruiting team introduced a modified Rooney Rule with the goal of having a diverse candidate slate for every role we are hiring for. We've moved away from traditional/elite college recruiting to we recruit future talent from and recently introduced AccelerateU, a new regionalized approach to college recruiting which allows us to reach a more diverse set of talent. We have also deepened our partnerships with key organizations including Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT), YearUp, LeanIn, Anita Borg and expanded engagement at the federal level on this issue with the Small Business Administration. These partners are helping drive change not only within LinkedIn but also within the industry overall. For example, our collaboration with our external partners and our internal Business Leadership Program leaders has resulted in a 40% increase in underrepresented minority hiring in our Global Sales Organization overall. These efforts are beginning to drive impact. So far in 2016, 5% of our overall new hires are Black and 6% are Latino. In 2015 we introduced unconscious bias training to help employees recognize and manage biases and their impact while promoting diversity, inclusion and belonging across the organization. It started with our people managers (20% of which had completed the training within the first 48 hours) and our recruiting team. We’ve expanded this training to include all employees and are now highlighting breaking bias training bytes in every decision point that impacts an employee-promotions, salary changes etc. Functional employee-led programs within our global sales (GSO), product and engineering and operations teams, have made a real impact.  With key learnings from these initiatives in mind, in July we introduced the LinkedIn Engagement and Development program (LEAD), designed to attract, engage and develop top Black and Latino talent at LinkedIn. In working with partners across the organization, LEAD has helped to increase the overall hiring representation of Black and Latino employees in our GSO organization by 6 percentage points. We believe that to truly drive change we need to foster an environment where once here, everyone feels they belong and can be their authentic self at LinkedIn. Every stage of the employee experience matters. We measure belonging in the candidate interview process and in employee engagement surveys. We are listening. We found that sharing moments of belonging is a key driver to engagement and intent to stay at LinkedIn. The data in this report is from July 2015-June 2016 to allow for year over year comparisons, excluding the tech employee data as we made a change to how we classify some roles. As of June 2016, we had 9,601 full-time employees. These numbers reflect both a work in progress, and one part of a broader story. As a company, LinkedIn is thinking more about diversity as it relates to our employees, as well as the current landscape across members and industries. A from the LinkedIn Economic Graph team found that in the last year, women accounted for nearly 43% of new hires -- up from about 39% in 2008. In 2016, about 30% of new hires in leadership were women -- up from nearly 28% in 2008. This suggests that while progress is being made, there is still room for improvement. We will continue to work together to increase the diversity and inclusiveness of our workforce while doubling down on creating more moments of belonging and authentic human connections for our diverse employees. Our continue to play a key role in helping bring this to life. We believe strongly that a sense of belonging is the key to unlocking the full potential of our employees and get closer to successfully achieving our collective vision.

The goal of endorsements is to provide a way for your connections to recognize you for your skills and expertise. The skills and endorsements on your profile help people viewing your profile understand your strengths and help you get discovered through search. This is important, because people with at least five skills listed on their LinkedIn profile receive up to 17x more profile views. While many people on LinkedIn use Endorsements, we realized that there was still more to do so we began to rethink feature. Delivering endorsements that provide even more value required a blend of research, new machine learning models and re-architecting the backend infrastructure that both serves and recommends new endorsements. These changes to “Skills & Endorsements” means we can better surface the most relevant endorsements that help to validate your skills, including: We’ve made endorsements smarter by highlighting endorsements that matter most to the viewer so you always look your best. For example, viewers will see endorsements made by mutual connections, colleagues, and people who are knowledgeable about the skill, which could give you the edge you need for your next job opportunity! We’ve improved targeting to suggest endorsements to connections that know the skills and your work best. This means the right connections are much more likely to validate you for the skills that you want to be recognized for. Tip: check that your skills are listed in order of the strengths you want to highlight and we’ll do the rest by targeting suggestions for those top skills. Now, when someone views your profile, they’ll only see the most relevant endorsements for the skills you want to highlight. With more than a third of hiring managers spending more than 60 seconds browsing your skills and endorsements, we want to make sure they’re seeing skills and endorsements that best represent your aspirations and help you stay ahead in your career. Not sure what your skills section looks like? Head over to your profile to make sure your skills are up-to-date so that your connections can help you connect to opportunity.

Employers need employees with cloud and distributed computing, statistical analysis and data mining skills to stay competitive.

You have the basics covered -- what to wear, how to talk about your experiences, questions to ask. But are you ready for the inevitable small talk? A featured in Harvard Business Review found that people who interview you do indeed judge you by your small-talk skills. To prepare for this informal chit chat, here are some tips on using LinkedIn to make a good first impression. Check out your interviewers’ LinkedIn profiles to see if you have any connections in common. Maybe both of you shared the same vendor or boss at some point? Highlighting shared connections helps reinforce the depth of your professional network. If your interviewer has published an article or shared an update on LinkedIn, it’s likely a topic that they care about. For example, if you work in technology and they’ve commented on AI, that’s a great topic to discuss. The hiring manager may have gone to the same school or your rival school. Bonding over that big football game is another way to find common ground. Check out the Volunteer Experiences section of your interviewers’ profile to see what they are passionate about, and ask them about it. Maybe you both participated in an event for the American Cancer Society or are both passionate about the Make a Wish Foundation. Take a look at the company’s LinkedIn to see what they’ve shared recently, then discuss. Every hiring manager wants to know that the candidate is invested in the company’s long term interests and culture. Chances are there are lots of good candidates interviewing for the position, so make sure you show your interest in the company itself. LinkedIn’s newly released Career Pages are a great place to learn more about the company’s culture, and even includes recent articles by employees at the company to give you a first hand look at what it’s like to work there. If the company has social media savvy executives, follow them on LinkedIn to stay up-to-date on company initiatives or passion projects that you can bring up during your interview. Small talk during interviews doesn’t have to be awkward. All it takes is a little research on LinkedIn to perfect your small-talk skills.

It’s this amazing culture that sets us apart, defines who we are and shapes what we aspire to be. There are many places where we can see the strong, positive impact our employees have made on the company, but one of the biggest is in our diversity, inclusion and belonging programs. Led by our six Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and three functional, employee-led initiatives, our talented people play an integral role in helping us foster a diverse and inclusive environment, where everyone can feel like they belong. While we could not capture the full impact of these groups in a few sentences, we wanted to share some examples of how they are helping create change. BIG’s mission is to utilize LinkedIn’s data, resources, and employees to close the opportunity gap for Black people in the technology industry. Recognizing that the Black shootings in the United States have had a profound impact on the Black & ally community at LinkedIn, BIG, in partnership with Hispanics of LinkedIn Alliance (HOLA), organized an employee town hall. This structured forum directly addressed the issues of racial injustice and belonging with a goal of empowering our US employees to have constructive discussions. This was an opportunity for peer-to-peer education, healing and a chance to educate their fellow employees on the challenges their community faces. More than 500 employees attended and many of them said it was one of the most memorable and impactful events they had ever participated in at LinkedIn. For some, it was their first true moment of belonging in their professional space. This group is focused on generating awareness, fostering inclusion and driving hiring of people with disabilities at our company, in our communities and in the world. EnableIn has created a more human-centric approach to disabilities accommodations and has partnered with IT to bring closed captioning to our all hands meetings and Facilities in working out a plan to add Braille to our meeting rooms. This year, for the first time in its history, LinkedIn sent out a survey giving US employees the opportunity to anonymously disclose whether they identified as having a disability. By giving employees this option, not only are they able to be their true selves at work, but as an employer, we now have a better understanding of our own population of employees with disabilities. EnableIn is now able to generate awareness around the prevalence of disabilities within our own company and work in partnership with our recruiting team to increase representation across our company.  HOLA is focused on building and empowering the Latino community, by fostering and maintaining an inclusive, supportive and culturally competent environment. This year they partnered with BIG on the employee town hall on race and together organized a quarterly meeting with our CEO and executives to engage them in a deeper conversation to raise awareness and increase knowledge and sensitivity to these issues and opportunities. Launched in July of this year, LEAD’s mission, in building on the success of WiN, is to attract, engage and develop top African American and Latino talent at LinkedIn. While the program is still new, the results to date have been encouraging. In working with partners across the organization, BIG and HOLA, LEAD has helped to increase the overall hiring representation of African American and Latino employees in our Global Sales Organization by 4%. This was accomplished through three key programs: focused sourcing and recruiting efforts on underrepresented minorities across all roles and levels, identifying and investing in high performing and high potential employees to help maximize and realize their full potential and building a tops-down culture committed to Black & Latino/a inclusion. Out@In’s mission is to engage, educate, and empower LinkedIn's LGBTA community, by fostering an inclusive and supportive environment. With 15 active chapters globally, Out@in has focused on raising visibility and engaging its members globally in 2016. Out@In partnered with The SF LGBTQ Center in April to host a Spring LGBT Career Fair that brought together 41 employers & community partners and more than 620 registered LGBTQ (and ally) attendees. In June, new a chapter successfully launched in Singapore with more than 50 members and allies participating in a fireside chat and showing support for Pink Dot SG, a nationwide movement promoting the freedom to love. Most recently, the Dublin chapter received an “Employee Network Group of the Year” award from the Workplace Equality Index, which is truly an honor, given the chapter’s only three years old. Our Veterans ERG is focused on connecting veterans with allies and creating and fostering an environment of support and empowerment. In September, we hosted the first ever in our New York City offices. This summit brought together more than 70 people, including business leaders, their veteran support teams and special guests from the nation's leading veteran-serving nonprofit organizations, to discuss best practices for attracting and retaining veteran talent. LinkedIn shared how to help employers find the 2.2M veterans through a new recruiter filter on our platform, and , a Medal of Honor recipient, spoke to the importance and benefit of hiring veterans into businesses. W@LI’s mission is to educate, inspire and connect women at LinkedIn and empower all of our employees to help cultivate an inclusive culture where people believe they belong. One of W@LI’s key programs are mentor rings. These small groups meet monthly to learn, grow together and leverage peer support. This year, mentor rings expanded to include both men and women with the goal of adding a more diverse perspective to the meetings. Of the more than 1,000 participants, spread across 10 countries, 67% choose to be in mixed gender rings. The women participating have found many benefits in these mentor rings and one male manager new to the mentor rings shared that is helping him “become a better leader at LinkedIn.” Women’s Initiative focuses on developing an inclusive workplace for employees in our global sales organization. WiN has helped the Global Sales leaders to focus on creating an inclusive environment. They have created programs to help invest in high potential women leaders with skill building, coaching, visibility and opportunities to showcase talent through executive sponsorship. They have also helped to increase the efforts to recruit and hire qualified senior women. The global sales organization has seen a 44% increase in women Senior Directors since the launch of the program in 2014. is an employee-led effort to challenge the gender imbalance among software engineers and other technical roles. This summer, the WIT team expanded a from seven to 10 participants. At the end of the program, 100% of the 2016 trainees said they would recommend the program to a friend, every participant declared an intent to study STEM in college and 90% declared an intent to study computer science in particular. The team hosted eight WomenConnect events to bring together like-minded professionals with similar experiences and backgrounds with more than 400 women attending. WIT is also leveraging the success of the WiN Invest program with a new push to accelerate the growth of senior, high performing women across LinkedIn’s engineering and product teams. 93% of the women in the first pilot program said would recommend this program to someone else. As you think about how to empower your own employees to do great things in your organization and beyond, we hope some of the great work these groups have done might be an inspiration. We recognize that our work is not done, we have more to do, learn and discover. But together we can help create economic opportunity for all."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Lists"],"author":"Daniel Roth","title":"Introducing the 2016 Next Wave: The 120 people making waves in some of the biggest industries","date":"October 11, 2016","content":"Today we launched the , our second annual reveal of the 10 must-know names who are transforming a dozen different industries. In profile after profile, you’ll find professionals who are leading their companies, business units, peers and employees toward a future that they see more clearly than most. These risk-takers have a sense of where the world is going — and are happy to guide the rest of us there. There are 120 examples of how that future plays out. But just to give you a taste of the range: You’ve got people like , the Google executive who is using marketing insights to stop ISIS recruiting. In entertainment, , the first predictive analytics expert at the NFL, is redefining what it means to succeed on the gridiron.

These Next Wavers are all leading their own initiatives, but in many ways they’re also all highlighting a few big themes (check out bestselling author Joshua Cooper Ramo’s for more on the power of knowing what’s next). For any of you looking to expand your career, take a look at the some of the big ideas that are emerging from our Next Wavers and their work: Trends and tech-driven innovation that have become common in consumer brands are starting to change the B2B world. That’s true whether you’re talking about to robots doing at Walgreens. The Next Wave honorees have 25X more connections than the average LinkedIn member, and 10% of their connections are with senior leaders, proving that a strong network is critical to success. Over 60 percent of the Next Wave honorees do not have an Ivy League education and 60 percent did not attend graduate school. These are still the early days, but every industry is seeing A.I. inroads, from self-driving trucks to robo-driven job interviews. Many of the Next Wavers are developing businesses that tackle issues critical to the entire planet, whether that’s developing sustainable protein sources from crickets or building a vertical farm that takes up less than 1 percent of the land required of conventional growers. Our Next Wave methodology remained the same as in 2015. To narrow down LinkedIn’s 450+ million member base to create this list, we examined millions of member interactions such as which profiles were most viewed by members in the same industry; social engagement performance and the frequency that candidates appeared in the news, using Newsle data. We limited the list to those who live in the U.S. (with international versions coming next year). We also applied an editorial lens and polled the 2015 Next Wavers to see who they’re watching now. Finally, we consulted LinkedIn Influencers such as Hotel Tonight CEO Sam Shank and CEO of Crisis Text Line Nancy Lublin to vet and suggest professionals in their industries. We also use an age cutoff for coming up with our list: 35 and under. Our goal is to surface people who are destined to be the leaders of tomorrow, those likely to one day lead or build large companies or launch major movements. The average age of a successful tech founder is 39, according to a the Kauffman Foundation. We tried to find the data that would give you a sneak peek at who some of these people might be — in tech and beyond.

Think Michael Jordan who left the Chicago Bulls to try his hand at baseball and then ultimately came back and took the Bulls to three more NBA championships. This is becoming more common because professionals are changing jobs more often. Over the last 20 years, the number of companies people worked for in the first five years after they graduated has nearly doubled, according to a recent . As a boomerang myself (I joined LinkedIn in 2011, left in 2014 and came back in 2015), I understand the fear that boomeranging may be seen as a regression or a return to a previous stage of your career, but in many ways it's not. Through my experience, I found that it helps to step back and consider a boomerang opportunity using the same rubric you would apply to any other job opportunity. Given that you have already worked at the company, boomeranging gives you specific insight that other employees typically don't have. With that in mind, here are four questions to answer when deciding if you should boomerang back. Assuming professional growth is one of your priorities, you don’t want to go back to the same role, doing the same work. However, if the company has grown while you were away, this is less of a concern. The business has grown, the people have changed, and the teams are facing new challenges. No matter how great the new opportunity is, there were a set of frustrations that made you decide to leave in the first place. Before coming back, you need to ensure that they have been mitigated, either by changes in the company, or changes in your perspective. You have a concentration of assets on which you can draw from to be successful, namely your professional network and reputation within the organization, as well as new knowledge of the company's technology, business, and operating processes. These represent significant advantages that you can use to grow your career. When thinking of boomeranging, the level of uncertainty is much lower, for both the company and the candidate. As a candidate, you know the good and the bad about the company. You also have a network of people who are still at the company who can give you an honest assessment of the current environment. You may already have a relationship with the hiring manager, mitigating some of the risks associated with joining a new company. When I was considering returning to LinkedIn, I looked at my options through this analysis. LinkedIn won hands-down on culture, leadership alignment, and professional growth. Deciding to come back felt like coming home mixed with a sense of accelerated positive change. I’ve now been back at LinkedIn for almost a year, and I’ve learned just as much as any other period in my career. One of LinkedIn’s core values is Relationships Matter, and when you are thinking of boomeranging back to your previous company, relationships definitely matter. Just because you left a company, doesn’t mean you can never come back. It is important to keep in touch with your previous colleagues through all aspects of your career journey, whether that journey takes you back to a company or to other opportunities. All in all, my biggest piece of advice is to check your bias at the door. You're not taking a step back in your career if you boomerang, on the contrary, you might find yourself growing in ways you hadn't even imagined. I’m very thankful to everyone at LinkedIn: Peers, mentors, friends, and managers who helped me overcome any hesitations I had about coming back. Boomeranging to LinkedIn has been an amazing experience, and I encourage anyone who has the opportunity to think about doing the same."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Life"],"author":"Pat Wadors","title":"How Inviting Your Employees’ Parents into the Office Can Improve Engagement","date":"September 19, 2016","content":"Today’s workforce isn’t seeking work-life balance, instead they’re looking for a A new generation of employees is rapidly becoming a major part of the global workforce: millennials. Today, they make up of the total U.S. workforce and will rise to 46% by 2020. They have different expectations and perspectives when it comes to the work world and there are unique opportunities for employers to meet them. Millennials tend to blur the lines between their work and personal lives more than other generation, even when it comes to perks. Perks that give millennials an opportunity to informally connect with their colleagues or bring their friends/family into their work life are high on their list of wants. At LinkedIn, our number one operating priority is our talent– securing it, developing it and fostering a culture that sets us apart as a company and makes people proud to be a part of. As a result, we’re constantly looking at ways to improve and that’s one of the reasons why we pioneered , returning for a fourth year on November 4th. It’s not just an opportunity to improve the relationship between a parent and their working child, but a chance for employers to improve the relationship they have with their employees. One way companies can help employees  bring their work and personal lives together is by giving them an opportunity to showcase what they do to their parents and loved ones. I’ve written previously about the , but bringing them into the workplace has allowed them to offer better career advice which in turn makes me a better professional. While I can tell you firsthand on the value of taking part in Bring In Your Parents Day is don't just take my word for it. Following the success of last year’s event, we worked with and ran a small focus group with previous BIYP participants to get their thoughts on how the day benefited them as a business. The group shared a number of insights, including 1) the positive impact the event had on both the employee and the parent, 2) how parents became more emotionally invested in their children’s employer, and 3) participating in the event had reputational value for the business since parents were more likely to recommend products or services. Employees are the most important asset to any business. As more and more millennials enter the workforce, ensuring that they feel valued, respected, appreciated, and engaged is only going to become more important.

Over the last year, our product and engineering teams have rebuilt and in some cases, completely overhauled, our core member experiences, with the goal of helping our 450+ million members get the most value they can from LinkedIn. We want all of our members to use LinkedIn to be productive and successful, stay connected and informed, and advance their careers. The data suggests the innovation and changes we’ve brought to market are working. Since our new was introduced last year and our messaging platform was rehauled, we’ve seen record levels of traffic and messages sent, and deeper engagement with our professional content and conversations happening every day across LinkedIn. We’re not slowing down. So, what’s next for Flagship? I couldn’t be more excited to share today how we plan to bring the goodness of our flagship to our desktop experience. Earlier today, we previewed a new look and feel with journalists for the desktop that offers a cleaner, simpler and more intuitive way for members to quickly access the jobs, information and insights they need. With this, professionals can be better prepared for their daily meetings or learn more about a new skill they’d like to acquire. This is the largest redesign since LinkedIn’s inception, and it’s the foundation for our future. Stay tuned for more details as we bring this new experience to our members soon. Through the LinkedIn Feed, we are inspiring and informing professionals every day with the most relevant industry and trending news. We want professionals coming to LinkedIn daily to get the right information on what’s trending in your company, in your industry, and in the news. We now have 500+ influencers on our platform, and our members are writing an average of 160,000 long-form posts per week. Today we previewed the biggest advancements to date with our Interest Feed, giving professionals even more ways to discover, search and dive deeper into relevant trending content. Relationships and networks matter more than ever in our professional lives. Conversations are how professionals connect and get business done, whether your goal is to get a round of funding, find a new job opportunity or source ideas and perspectives. Since our new mobile app was introduced last year and the rehaul of our messaging platform, we’ve seen a 240 percent increase in the number of messages sent, and half of our active members are using our messaging platform every week. Today, we showed how we are building on this momentum and offering an even smarter messaging platform with the ability to message a connection wherever you may be on LinkedIn. We also previewed something I’m incredibly excited about -- our messaging bot technology. How often do you wish you had a personal concierge or an assistant to help you identify and schedule a time that works for a meeting? We believe this combination of bots and messaging on LinkedIn could be game changing and will something our members can use daily. Learning is an area I’m personally passionate about and I believe LinkedIn is in a unique position to completely change how professionals acquire the skills they need to advance their careers. We know the useful shelf life of professional skills has shrunk to less than five years. There is a critical need to help people acquire new skills through a highly personalized, data-driven and engaging learning experience. And we couldn’t be more thrilled to fill this need with , combining industry-leading content from Lynda.com with LinkedIn’s rich professional data and network. With more than 450 million member profiles, we have a unique view of how jobs, industries, organizations and skills evolve over time. From this, we can take the guesswork out of what to learn by identifying the skills you need and deliver expert-led courses to help you obtain those skills.

In fact, while we were growing up, we counted down the years until we were free from the classroom. It wasn’t until we took the time to hone in on our passion and purpose that our eyes were opened to a deep love for learning. Since then, we’ve learned to look beyond the brick and mortar of a classroom and enroll in an education of a lifetime. For us, learning is about tailoring your education to your unique personal makeup, and to always be learning. It’s realizing that each time you meet a mentor, make a cold call, or read a new article, you’re participating in the expansive classroom of life. A few years back, we realized that the current paths we were on weren’t going to take us to our end goal. So halfway through high school, I decided to homeschool in order to fully pursue my passion for filmmaking. Around this time, Kody decided to go after his BA in entrepreneurship through online courses at . This allowed him to graduate debt-free, have the flexibility to travel, and the freedom to start his own business. Both being at home, we combined our passions. This led to the birth of our adventure filmmaking and lifestyle brand, . When no one told us we had to memorize X to get grade Z, we learned the most in our areas of curiosity. This encouraged us to pursue avenues of learning such as leading a weekly think tank of young entrepreneurs called “Outbound Thinking”, and regularly attend leadership conferences such as “ ”. We are constantly looking for ways to grow ourselves and push past our limits. Something we often say is that you need to choose your teachers and textbooks wisely. We approach these words with a very holistic definition. We view “teachers” as those who are steps ahead of us in life and inspire us. We really encourage people to have the audacity to pursue learning from their biggest role models on earth. This is why we’ve made it a priority to pursue and learn directly from some of our biggest inspirations around, including Devin Supertamp (the most followed adventure filmmaker on YouTube) and Chris Burkard (the most followed travel photographer on Instagram). LinkedIn has been a tool we use to break down perceived barriers to engage and interact with these individuals. It gives us unparalleled access to high profile individuals by simply sending an InMail or getting an introduction. We view our “textbooks” as material that will enrich our lives in practical and applicable ways. Notice we don’t limit this curriculum to written text. While we do make it a habit of reading each day, we primarily read only about subjects that directly correlate with our passions. One day we may read from entrepreneurial and thought leaders such as or . Other days we will watch TED talks, or listen to podcasts by influencers such as Michael Hyatt or Gary Vaynerchuk. Had we never embarked on the education of a lifetime, we most likely wouldn’t have started the company The Outbound Life, which has gotten us to where we are today. At the ages of 20 and 23 we are currently leading this movement, where each day young people are embracing the mindset that they have so much more potential than previously imagined. In these last few months alone, we spoke at TEDx Memphis, worked with Southwest Airlines as social media influencers, and helped produce global launch commercials for companies such as DJI (world's leading drone manufacturer) and Manfrotto (leading manufacturer of camera support products). We are constantly blown away by the opportunities that appear in our lives as well as the lives of so many others when learning is viewed not as a burden but instead more as a love affair. Are you excited about learning these days? If not, it might be time to pursue your curiosity and enroll in the education of a lifetime. #AlwaysBeLearning"},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News","Privacy"],"author":"Sara Harrington","title":"LinkedIn’s Transparency Report about Government Requests for Member Data: First Half of 2016","date":"September 30, 2016","content":"Today we’re releasing our semiannual , in keeping with our continued commitment of transparency to our members.

As the Facilities Site Supervisor for our Sao Paulo office, I am excited to give a look inside what’s unique about our team, culture and how we are working towards LinkedIn’s vision of creating economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce.  São Paulo is Brazil’s largest city and Latin America’s financial center. It’s located 222 miles southwest of Rio de Janeiro. You might know it as one of the sites where the 2016 Summer Olympics were recently held. Our first LinkedIn Brazil office opened in 2011 with just one employee. At the time, we had six million LinkedIn members in Brazil and our office was one small room with no windows in a rented office suite. In 2014, we moved into our current office. Today we have almost 170 people employees and 26 million members in Brazil and 63 million members in all of Latin America. As the only LinkedIn office in Latin America, multiculturalism is extremely important, and many of our employees are from countries across South and Central America. , a Relationship Manager is a good example of this. “I love working for LinkedIn Brazil because the people are funny, friendly and hardworking. Here we can learn about other cultures. Even though I’m from Colombia, I feel at home here in Sao Paulo.” Since a large majority of our São Paulo-based team are a part of our sales organization they constantly engage with customers both in Brazil and other countries. This means many of them speak Portuguese, Spanish and English to provide the best possible customer experience. As , a Sales Development Team Lead explains, \"I enjoy working at LinkedIn because everything that we do is for our customers and members to deliver on our mission and make the best impact on society. We strive to live LinkedIn’s culture and values and help make our customers more successful every day.”  As in most Latin American offices, lunch is a very important time in the São Paulo office. One of our key values at LinkedIn is Relationships Matter and we see lunchtime as a way for our employees to build those personal relationships with their colleagues. Immediately after eating, we all go brush our teeth, a routine post-lunch activity here in Brazil. Here’s why , Head of Financial Services, Healthcare and Education loves the culture at LinkedIn. \"I believe that what makes our culture so special is our team. Most of LinkedIn’s employees are intelligent, kind, collaborative and genuinely good human beings.”    And it comes as no surprise that here in Brazil we are all very passionate about sports, especially with the Summer Olympics having just taken place. To make sure we didn’t miss any big moments, all of the Olympic events were streamed on a big screen in our cafe where everyone could watch the games together in the office.

Despite decades of research, work and laws to correct the gap in salaries, full-time working women in the United States today earn only 79 percent of men’s wages. We agree that companies need to step forward and play an active role in helping to close that gap. Although these 28+ companies are a start, we won’t be enough. LinkedIn’s vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce, and we believe that a fundamental piece of this is equal pay for equal work. It starts with each of us. It will take all of us. We believe it is a basic good business practice to ensure this is true within your own organization. This change will benefit the individual who will now be paid fairly for their work, the company that will see improvements in their culture and the world by increasing purchasing power to one of the largest consumers of goods globally. Put simply, a rising tide lifts all boats. At LinkedIn, we strive to create an environment where all of our employees feel inspired to do their best work, and part of that has involved regularly reviewing and evaluating our own pay practices to ensure our employees are being compensated fairly. The solution to fair pay is rarely a matter of making a simple, one-time tweak to an existing system. Instead, companies and leaders must make a commitment to break this bias wherever we come across it. We’ve found you need to put practices in place to ensure better outcomes for all individuals while maintaining and in many cases increasing positive outcomes for the company. Studies show that the pay gap often starts with the initial salary negotiation. By implementing changes to help reduce the impact to salary in the negotiation period, you have the opportunity to start employees on a level-playing field. Once employees have a seat at the table, it’s ensuring the loudest voice in the room does not necessarily command the biggest salary or the best opportunities for advancement. Break the bias at the moment of decision by inserting training on unconscious bias when the hiring, promotion or salary increase decisions are being made. Overall, we are committed to continuing to create diverse teams, encourage diversity of thought in an inclusive work environment where every person feels they truly belong​ and are paid fairly.

As you may have noticed, all of the skills on the list are “hard skills,” or specific skills required to do a job that can be learned. That’s why we were surprised when recruiters started telling us that they were having a hard time finding people with the right “soft skills,” or personal attributes that help people interact effectively with others – like communication, teamwork and critical thinking. Hard skills vary based on the job, but soft skills are required for every job. For example, a cook must be able to finely dice vegetables, but a server doesn’t. But both must be team players and communicate effectively for the restaurant they work in to succeed. That makes soft skills extremely valuable, and the growing lack of them provides professionals like you with an opportunity to stand out from the pack! That’s why we tapped into the to see what we could uncover on soft skills. Our research led to the development of — this is a new Lynda.com Learning Path designed to help people learn the most in-demand soft skills. It’s free for everyone for the next 30 days, so check it out! Here’s what we uncovered: We asked 291 U.S. hiring managers how hard it was to find candidates with the right soft skills for each of the jobs they were hiring for. They said it’s hard to find people with the right soft skills for fifty-nine percent of their open jobs. To find the most sought after soft skills, we analyzed the soft skills listed on the profiles of members who (defined as a member changing their employer on their LinkedIn profile) between June 2014 and June 2015 to identify the most sought-after soft skills among employers. If you have these soft skills, but haven’t added them to your LinkedIn Profile, add them because they can help you stand out from other candidates. And if you don’t have them, make sure you take advantage of , to appear more attractive to recruiters. Finally, we identified the industries where soft skills are most and least common among professionals. The following lists are good indicators of the industries where demand for soft skills is highest and lowest, and where they are most and least valued. These are the 10 industries where soft skills are least common among professionals: The results of this analysis represent the world seen through the lens of LinkedIn data. It’s influenced by how members choose to use the professional network, which can vary based on professional, social, and regional culture. These variances were not accounted for in the analysis. We adopted a simple definition of “active job seeker” as a U.S. member who applied for two or more jobs on LinkedIn between June 2014 and June 2015. This gave us a sample of 2.3 million members. We then looked at whether each member found a job between the first date they clicked apply, and six months from the last date they applied to a job. We calculated a job switching rate among this sample of “active job seekers,” whether they found a new job or not. That gave us the most in-demand soft skills list. The in-demand list of soft skills derived from a total set of 58 soft skills that were manually curated prior to conducting the research. This list of 58 soft skills contain only raw text strings inputted by members (with minimal corrections applied to typos). So there will be classes of skills that appear as distinct skills, when their meanings could be interpreted to be similar. For example, both “interpersonal communication” and “communication” are included in the analysis as distinct soft skills when there’s clearly semantic overlap between the two terms. We don’t make an attempt to group soft skills with similar interpretations, and analyze those member inputted skills “as-is”."},{"post_categories":["Member Stories"],"author":"Catherine Fisher","title":"Forget What You Do, Focus On How You Do It","date":"August 8, 2016","content":"When it comes to pursuing work greatly, it’s not what we do that matters, it’s how we do it that can change the trajectory of our careers.

In fact, the number of freelancers on LinkedIn has grown by nearly 50% in just the past five years. As the workforce evolves, we, too, are evolving to ensure we’re creating opportunity for the expanding sector of professionals looking for independent, project-based work in place of the typical 9 to 5 profession. Last October, we began piloting a brand new platform in support of this very endeavor and today, we’re excited to announce its nationwide availability. Introducing , a LinkedIn marketplace that connects consumers and small businesses looking for professional services - think , , , , - with top quality freelance professionals best suited for the job. Whether you’re looking for someone to design your custom wedding invitations, file your personal taxes, or write copy for your small business website, LinkedIn ProFinder makes it easier for you to hire the right freelancer for the job by leveraging the power of our trusted LinkedIn network. In its pilot stage, the platform already features more than 50,000 freelancers across more than 140 service areas - each of whom have been hand-picked based on their expertise and high quality recommendations. So why is this important to LinkedIn and what do we see for ProFinder’s future? Well, with our network of more than 450 million members we feel we can play an important role in driving and supporting the gig economy. In fact, as part of our pilot we’ve dug into our own LinkedIn data to glean more insights about this new and growing sector of the workforce. Did you know, for example, that the South is a burgeoning region for freelance talent? Here are a just a few of the insights we uncovered: When looking at net growth and decline in freelancers by state, the Southern states of Florida and Texas were two of the three states showing the most freelancer growth in the country. Colorado was the other top contender. When ranking states/districts with the highest freelance population overall, the East and West Coasts topped the list. Healthcare and pharmaceutical industries have seen more than 50% growth in freelance workers over the past five years compared to 21% growth for non-freelance workers. The gig economy is a growing and influential part of the modern workforce and we aim to provide the same type of value for these independent workers as those in more traditional 9 to 5 professions. On the other side of the coin, we strive to extend this value to our members looking to hire these types of white-collar freelance professionals. If you have a home improvement or repair project, there are a number of established on-demand marketplaces available for those needs. But what if you’re looking to buy your first home? Or you’re in need of some professional coaching as you navigate your next career move? Finding the right person for these types of professional services can feel like finding a needle in a haystack.

His story, while unique in so many ways, contains a message for all of us. Each of us has a choice to make when we wake up in the morning. Am I going to give my all to what I do? What is my purpose? Your answer to these questions will determine your path, your success, and even your happiness. Today, we’re unveiling a series called “ .” Its intent is to salute LinkedIn members who, no matter what their calling, pursue it with passion, commitment, and resilience. Our hope is that these stories will inspire all our members to #ChaseGreat. For we found that purpose is not the exclusive domain of what are traditionally considered the \"worthy\" professions, but instead can be found in all walks of life and all work. This exploration uncovered valuable insights into what it means to pursue a career \"greatly\" – insights that suggest LinkedIn can help you take action. The phrase \"Believe in yourself\" has become a cliché, like those found in Lifetime movies and on cheap inspirational posters with pictures of kittens trying to get onto a sofa. But the truth about self-belief is that it is hard – self-belief comes from having the immense courage to know and then to be your authentic self. Few people are born with such utter blind confidence; those who are may not always be the most successful due to their lack of empathy. In this series, you’ll meet Samantha who became a chef because she loved the joy people experienced when they ate her food. But when she was starting out, she seriously doubted her abilities because she hadn’t gone to culinary school. She found that the harder she worked in the restaurant scene in NYC, the more her confidence grew. A year into her career, Samantha proudly stands beside other accomplished chefs, and is steering her own future forward. Doubts do not disprove ability; many may think they do, but many more have proved otherwise. No successful person does it alone. Every successful person, with perhaps the exception of the most delusional narcissist, will point to mentors, teachers, supporters, friends, and contacts being instrumental to their success. It’s the people in our lives who give us strength, who open doors and urge us on. We also had the honor of meeting Marwan, a Syrian refugee who risked his life to go to Turkey and then Sweden on a rubber dinghy. Every step along his arduous journey, people helped him – from finding a job in a bakery to becoming an English teacher, to now interning at a news center. While it’s important for him to realize his potential, his primary goal is to get his family to safety. It is not our greatest challenges that define who we become. It is how we reach after them. The semantic bankruptcy and gross overuse of once powerful phrases such as \"Impossible is nothing\" endanger and belittle this critical insight into success. This topic is hard to generalize about because we are all very different; in our confidence levels, our raw intelligence, and the degree to which we are sure of our purpose. The learnings from our work reveal one key thought, though: How you respond to the inevitable curveballs and setbacks is more important than the nature of the setbacks themselves. It is not easy to pick yourself up off the ground, dust yourself off and, as our CEO once advised me: to not allow yourself to be defined by a failure. Learn from it, embrace it, talk about it, own it, and be stronger for it. A professor at Princeton re-wrote his entire resume highlighting only failures instead of successes as he felt it reflected more powerfully on him as a person. At age 24, model and activist Lauren Wasser was living her dream as a fashion model when she suffered from Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). She left the hospital with a prosthetic leg and half a foot. Instead of giving in to her darkest thoughts, she is now focusing on what’s possible and dedicating her life to redefining beauty. It is stories like these that inspire us every day to help our members expand their vision of all they can achieve.

So whether you’re on the bus or the train, you can be more productive, and take control of your career.  By tapping on the “Me” tab you can add your recent skills, update your experience and even snap a picture and upload it while on the go. These are the some of the first things recruiters look for in your profile, and critical to connecting you to people, opportunities, and skills that can help build your career. Your photo is your virtual handshake, so upload a photo that aligns with your role as a professional, but that makes you approachable. Members who include a profile photo receive 21x more profile views and up to 36x more messages. Upload directly from your phone, but make sure it’s good quality and includes you only, not your pet or significant other. Being so strongly identified with your dog or your husband might not be appropriate unless you're a vet or a marriage counselor and that's part of your professional image. Make sure it’s up to date and includes your title, company name, and time period. Members with “up to date” positions are discovered up to 18x more in searches by members and recruiters. If you're currently in transition, rather than note unemployed you can add a title similar to what you want to pursue. For example, “marketing executive open to field marketing positions.” Also, show the year in the date field, so for example “2016 to present.” If you’re just entering the workforce then it is critical to include your education, which is not only important to potential employers but also it can also help reconnect you to alumni and to past school friends. Maintaining a relevant list of skills on your profile will help others understand your strengths and match you with the right opportunities. Depending on what stage you are in your career you should try to add at least 5 skills. Members with 5 or more skills listed are contacted (messaged) up to 33x more by recruiters and other LinkedIn members, and receive up to 17x more profile views. One tip, check your skills are listed in order of the strengths you want to be known for, and LinkedIn will do the rest by targeting endorsers for those top skills you’ve prioritized, and the more endorsements you have for your  skills the higher you rank in search results. More than 30% of recruiters will use advanced search based on location, so the more details you have the more likely you will be found and connected to your next opportunity. Also, former colleagues may want to reconnect if they have recently relocated or are travelling for work. While adding a summary can be daunting it’s your opportunity to tell a story of  who you are, your experience, the type of things you are interested in, and goals you would like to achieve. A summary of 40 words or more makes it more likely to show up in search, and consider calling out your specialities for keyword search. And, don’t be shy to add some personality -- nearly 40% of recruiters are looking for this. Your profile is your professional profile of record and making small changes now to reflect the work you do will increase your visibility in your industry, and will give recruiters, potential clients or connections more insight into who you are and what you do.

At that time, I had no idea what was next. I didn’t know if I was going to mess up or flat out not make it. What I did know was that whatever I chose to do, I would be humble, be grateful, and not let anyone outwork me. My whole life, I had planned to play football professionally. I desperately needed football growing up because my father was in and out of my life, and my mother juggled multiple jobs to make ends meet. What started out as after-school care became my passion, community and opportunity to travel the country. To make it to the next level, I knew I needed to put in the effort. I stayed after practice as much as I could. I spent many summer nights working out alone to prepare for the upcoming season. I raced my best friend up a steep hill in my neighborhood every night. The hard work paid off. I played college football at San Francisco City College, and then was recruited to play on scholarship for Western Oregon University. I was playing pretty well and thought I’d go pro – make it big so I could take care of my family. After putting up some average statistics while playing my last two seasons in Oregon, however, I didn’t receive much attention other than from an AFL team, and some invitations to workout for European league scouts. It was a let down to come up short from my original aspirations of the NFL. But I knew I was capable of more than just playing football. Instead of taking even more of a toll on my body to maybe end up on somebody’s roster, I decided to stay in Oregon and finish my studies in Business Marketing. When I stopped playing football, my college scholarship ended too. Double disappointment. But I was determined to finish what I started. To pay my tuition, I worked more than 40 hours a week and went to school full-time. Despite the financial struggle, I fully expected to graduate, and I got really close. That’s when I found out my long-term girlfriend was pregnant with my daughter. I made the tough decision to leave college early and move back home to California to be closer to my daughter. I had nothing lined up professionally. When I heard that a lot of inner-city young adults were finding their way and receiving great opportunities at big companies through a program called , I decided to give that a shot. Two days after moving back, I got an interview with Year Up and they gave me an opportunity to participate in the program. At Year Up, I worked harder than I ever had with a lot of late nights and early mornings to prepare myself for a career in the corporate world. I honed my technical skills – from creating websites from scratch to delivering elevator pitches. More importantly, I learned how to always carry myself with confidence and dignity. This training helped me land a job working in sales for . My career in sales is surprisingly similar to my career in football because they’re both really competitive fields driven by numbers. Salespeople collaborate well, but at the end of day, we’re all trying to hit our numbers. It’s the same thing as football where everyone is competing to have better stats. And my approach remains unchanged – I will not be outworked – so I spend a lot of extra time and effort on professional development. My daughter is coming up on two years old in September. She’s an angel. My financial situation is much more stable. I can now provide for my daughter without having to ask my mom to borrow money for diapers or daycare. I find myself now asking to help my mom, and show her appreciation for all she's done. I’m getting to a place where I can start putting together long-term plans for my future, and that’s a great feeling. A lot of things didn’t turn out the way I had imagined, but no matter what, I always try and make the most of every situation. I’m always thinking about what I can do today to be better than I was yesterday. My advice for those who #ChaseGreat... Keep your eyes on the prize and have no regrets. Embrace both the failures and the wins - there’s always something to learn.

Who are they? What do they want? Why are their actions and customs so strange? How can we learn to tolerate them before they take over? Full disclosure: I am a millennial. But I don’t have scales or a forked tongue. I’m just one of millions of young professionals taking on the world as it is, trying to shape it more into the world I hope it becomes. Given the massive amounts of news coverage (44,000 articles and counting), it seems like everyone is desperate to understand my generation. Thankfully, we don’t have to rely on stereotypes or sensationalism to find out. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions researched the millions of millennials on LinkedIn to take a data-based approach to the problem. They compiled the results in the , a guide for millennials who chase great, and for those other generations trying to figure us out. The first thing I discovered during our research is there are more millennials out there than I imagined. Turns out, we’re the largest generation on Earth, about 2 billion strong. There are 85 million of us in the U.S. alone, and all told we claim $1 trillion in purchasing power annually. But as much as we get stereotyped, generalized, and lumped in together, we’re not hive-minded snake people. Marketing research by identifies four broad categories we fall into: #TrendNetters are the closest to the media perception of millennials. They live their lives online, and thrive on feedback and peer recognition #AlterNatives are more quiet, introverted, and concerned with privacy. They’re more tech-savvy than others because they want control of the devices they own #LYFPreneurs are ambitious, hard-working, hard-playing go-getters looking to find the next transformative business model #BetaBlazers are intensely knowledgeable, forward-thinking, trailblazing types who are all about quality over quantity Notice how the stereotypes of “lazy” and “entitled” disappear when you take a closer look? Millennials, it turns out, are as industrious and innovative as anyone else. We may be blazing new trails to get to our goals, but we’re on the move. Regardless of which persona they fall into, millennials are making their way in the working world. The job market is radically different now than it was even ten years ago. Millennials have had to adjust their goals and their expectations. LinkedIn’s research discovered the number one thing millennials want out of a job is advancement opportunity, narrowly beating out better pay and challenging work. That makes sense; the days of spending 40 years in one job are long gone. We want to move up the ladder fast. And if we get stalled, we’re not shy about seeking out new opportunities. We’re not about to settle for less. We know that millennials love their social media. Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat…the list goes on. But I was pleasantly surprised to see how many of my generation are investing time on LinkedIn as well. There are 87 million millennials on LinkedIn worldwide, and 11 million are classified as “decision makers.” Not only that, millennials represent 30% of long-form publishers on LinkedIn, even though we’re less than 25% of total members. Some of my favorite insights from the come from interviews with millennials who are thriving in the workforce. There’s , the Inbound Marketing Manager at Uberflip. , Marketing Manager at Company.com. And started her own successful agency, Millennovation® Media. These three innovators and leaders—and many more in the playbook—bear out what LinkedIn’s research found: Millennials are moving in and moving up. There’s no denying millennials are chasing great. Some of us want the thrill of recognition. Some just want to make the world a better place. Some just can’t resist pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. No matter what motivates us, millennials are more than willing to put in the effort it takes to get ahead. So the last chapters of the playbook are all about channeling that effort into building a professional network and personal brand. Combine a millennial’s enthusiasm, energy, and skill with LinkedIn’s inherent ability to connect people, and you create an unbeatable team. If you’re a millennial yourself, check out the for a wealth of practical information you can use in your career journey. If you’re not a millennial, and especially if you think of us as snake people, read it to see what we’re really like, where we are now, and where we’re headed."},{"post_categories":["Veterans"],"author":"Greg Call","title":"LinkedIn's First Annual Veteran Insights Report: An Inside Look at U.S. Veterans in the Workplace","date":"May 31, 2016","content":"LinkedIn’s Veterans Program is proud to announce the launch of its . In 2012, I was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps and became part of a veteran community that was facing atrocious unemployment rates.

During that search, I met and worked with some inspiring people and organizations, like the , , , and the , and witnessed an amazing transformation. Our community rose up and together developed programs to eliminate the barriers our fellow veterans faced in connecting with opportunity. Fast forward through years of hard work from members and supporters of the veteran community, and we saw post-9/11 veteran unemployment cut in half to 4.1% -- almost a full percentage lower than the overall U.S. unemployment rate. Veterans are now “in-demand” talent in the workforce. With more than 2.1 million veteran and military members on LinkedIn, the LinkedIn Veterans Program team decided to leverage LinkedIn’s Economic Graph to glean insights into the professional identities of this growing veteran community. With 2.1 million veteran and military LinkedIn members, our team analyzed their professional experience, skills, education, and behaviors, as well as veteran employer data. Here’s what we found: Information Technology is the number one industry where veterans are employed Networking is the number one method veterans find career opportunities More than 186,000 veteran professionals are executives, vice presidents, founders, owners or partners in the workforce Our data shows a veteran community that is aligning its skills with high growth industries. It shows a community that builds and leverages professional networks to advance their career. And, most importantly, it shows a community that utilizes its leadership training in the military to become leaders in the civilian workforce. This report is not only meant to celebrate the successes of the veteran community, but also to provide insight into the modern veteran professional for organizations that empower this very community. We hope these insights can be a resource for the federal government, veteran non-profits, and veteran program managers as they further develop programs designed to continue the reduction in veteran unemployment for those that have sacrificed so much for this country.

If you’re worried you wouldn’t be prepared to sell yourself, you’re not alone. Forty-six percent of the professionals we recently surveyed admitted they would not feel confident in effectively describing their achievements if they chanced upon their dream employer on the street. The research indicates we’re so uncomfortable touting our work successes that we’d rather share our political views on social media than let our followers know we received a promotion or got a new job. But being able to sell ourselves without coming across as overly self-promotional is important to succeed in any career. In fact, 86% of recruitment decision makers agree it’s important that candidates can clearly communicate achievements. So how can we overcome this barrier and learn to proudly tell our work story? Today we released the results of our latest @Work study, an annual global survey that explores generational, cultural, and industry-specific changes in the workplace. This time we looked into attitudes toward sharing professional successes and what we can do to make that great first impression at work. After hearing from professionals in 18 countries, some interesting data emerged:  40% admit it’s difficult to describe what it is they do for a living Only 35% feel confident describing their professional achievements 52% of workers stated they would rather talk about a colleague’s achievements than their own 76% agree it’s difficult to overcome a bad first impression So why do we hold back? Some 53% of workers admitted they feel like they are bragging. In a world of selfies and sharing what we have for breakfast, it’s strange that we still hold back from shouting about our work achievements. In fact, we’re more likely to share health updates (25%) and political views (23%) on social media than news of a promotion (17%). Interestingly, 65% of people agree the impression you make online is just as important as the one you make in person. And that’s an area where LinkedIn can help — it’s the perfect place to showcase your professional successes. Here are a few simple steps to help you : PHOTO: Your photo is your virtual handshake, so upload an approachable profile photo that aligns with your role as a professional. Members with a profile photo receive up to 21x more profile views. WORK EXPERIENCE: One of the most important parts of your profile is your job history, including your current position, industry and length of employment. LinkedIn members with current positions receive up to 5x more connection requests. If you’re just entering the workforce, include your education and add a summary of who you are and what you aspire to be. SKILLS: Add five relevant skills and you’ll be messaged up to 31x more by recruiters and other members. LOCATION: More than 30% of recruiters use location when searching for candidates, so make sure to add your location, making it easier for them to find you. SUMMARY: A summary of at least 40 words is more likely to show up in search. Be sure to add a little personality — nearly 87% of recruiters are looking for it! There’s never been a better time to get comfortable being a little uncomfortable.

Notice that I said every member, not just white collar workers with four-year college degrees. Everyone. To achieve our vision, we’re building the world’s first — a digital map of the global economy that includes every member of the global workforce and their skills, all open jobs, all employers, and all educational institutions. We’ve been sharing labor market insights from the Economic Graph with dozens of policymakers across the globe to help create greater economic opportunity. For example, we’ve been sharing Economic Graph insights with policymakers in Colorado and Phoenix. We realized the combination of our Economic Graph insights and the LinkedIn platform can have an even greater economic impact. So we joined (formerly Rework America Connected) — a initiative to help workers in Colorado and Phoenix with high school diplomas and some or no college education acquire new skills to advance their careers. This is important because , have a high school diploma and some or no college education. Yet 44% of the more than 468 recruiters and hiring managers we surveyed in Colorado and Phoenix in February said it’s hard to find people with the right technical skills. Companies that have a hard time hiring are less productive, which stunts the growth of the local economy. Educational institutions — like community colleges, boot camps, and vocational schools — that collaborate with local employers typically have high placement rates. This is because they tailor training programs to teach students skills that are in demand. Sixty-one percent of the 914 recruiters and hiring managers we surveyed in Colorado and Phoenix said they’d benefit from working more closely with educators. We’re using Economic Graph data to show employers which educational institutions they hire from, and show educators which companies their graduates work at and need their students’ skills. This data makes it easier for employers to identify which educators they should collaborate with, and vice versa. Plus we’re encouraging Colorado and Phoenix employers to include the skills required for jobs in their job descriptions to help job seekers determine whether or not they’re qualified for jobs. And most importantly, we’re making the collaboration that’s occurring between employers and educators transparent to the people who need that info most: job seekers. Thirty-nine percent of the 355 U.S. workers who have a high school diploma and some or no college education we surveyed said they want to advance their career in their current field. Forty-two percent said they want to get a new job in a different field. But 54% said they don’t know what jobs are available, and whether or not they need additional training to acquire the skills required for those jobs. That’s why we developed — a new product that helps job seekers acquire new skills and advance their careers. It shows them relevant training programs in their area; which programs are affiliated with employers; whether or not they’re accredited; the program’s employment rate, cost, and duration; the skills the program will teach them; the jobs they’ll be qualified for when they complete the program; and the estimated salary. These insights will help them choose the training program that will teach them the skills they need to get the job they want. For now, Training Finder is targeted at job seekers in Phoenix and Colorado who have a high school diploma and some or no college education and want to advance their career in their current field, or get a new job in a different field. If that describes you, check out Training Finder. You can also talk to a career coaches by visiting . Colorado and Phoenix are both doing great work to up-skill workers. We’re hopeful that Skillful will amplify their efforts and help create skills-based labor markets that value people’s skills -- not just their degrees -- and empowers lifelong learning so that workers’ skills evolve with the ever-changing skills needed by companies. Skillful is one of many examples of how we’re using the Economic Graph and LinkedIn to help create economic opportunity. In June, we with the GMCA (Greater Manchester Combined Authority) in the United Kingdom to provide insight into the workforce’s existing skills, the skills required to get jobs in Greater Manchester, and the gap between the two. The will be used by the GMCA , and by local educational institutions to tailor courses so they teach students in-demand skills. We also used Economic Graph data to with greater insight into its tech sector. Toronto is using the data to help youths learn tech-related skills and bolster its tech sector. For example, Seneca College — one of the largest colleges in Canada — is updating its curriculum and offering new courses to help prepare youths for careers in tech. And we used Economic Graph data , as part of its , with insights on the current state of the city’s tech industry. The city used the insights to determine “how to deploy $10 million in funding to help NYC schools, government, nonprofits, and companies better prepare New Yorkers for in-demand tech jobs and fuel the continuing growth of NYC tech businesses.” If you’re interested in learning more about the Economic Graph and the work we’re doing to create economic opportunity, please follow the ."},{"post_categories":["Featured","Veterans"],"author":"Greg Call","title":"Medal of Honor Recipient Florent Groberg and LinkedIn Partner on Veterans Program","date":"March 28, 2016","content":"If anyone has had the privilege to hear retired U.S. Army Capt. speak, he always says, “It’s time to make a bigger difference.” And today, LinkedIn is proud to announce that we are forming a partnership with Florent to do just that for our military and veteran community.

With millions of Millennials graduating in the next two months -- many of whom are likely evaluating jobs and deciding which industries they’ll work in -- now is as good a time as any to analyze data to find out once and for all if millennials are getting a bad, job-hopping rap; which industries people job-hop most and least in; and whether men or women job-hop more. Here’s what we uncovered: Over the last 20 years, the number of companies people worked for in the five years after they graduated has nearly doubled. People who graduated between 1986 and 1990 averaged more than 1.6 jobs, and people who graduated between 2006 and 2010 averaged nearly 2.85 jobs. As you can see in the graph below, the number of companies people work for five to 10 years after graduating has increased as well. What caused the uptick in job-hopping? We can’t say for sure. But common hypotheses include the Great Recession, and Millennials being more interested than previous generations in trying out different jobs before settling on a career. But one thing is for sure: upcoming and recent grads are likely going to job-hop more than previous generations, which means investing in professional relationships is more important than ever! Nearly while looking for their next gig. Of those who connected with former colleagues, 53% said it helped them land their current job. The old adage, holds true.

With no career role models to guide her, she had to figure it out on her own. She spent hours on the Internet at the local library, searching for the information that would bring her vision into focus. At 16, she finally got a home computer and began to install software, modify hardware, and explore possibilities. As she built her technical skills, her vision of being a businesswoman snapped into focus. She knew she wanted a career in engineering. I was driven to network, find people who could help me, tell them what I wanted to do. I didn’t think about hearing ‘no’...I just went for it. As a student at a technology networking event, Rutha looked around the room and felt one paralyzing emotion: fear. Everyone around her was well into their careers. How could she approach them and introduce herself, let alone ask for their help? After a flash of self doubt, the truth hit: she belong in the room. She had the education and background to pursue a career as a software engineer. More importantly, she had a sense of purpose compelling her forward. Rutha was determined not to let this opportunity pass her by. She built up her courage and circulated through the crowd introducing herself. Little did she know that she was just one connection away from launching her career in technology. I want to be role model for the next generation. I want them to see themselves, male or female, of any color, of any income bracket, to really see that they have a place in a STEM career. At the technology networking event, Rutha met Celeste Brown, an engineer at Intel. Rutha connected with her on LinkedIn during their first conversation. A month later, Intel hired Rutha as a Software Validation Engineer. With a clear idea of who she wanted to become, Rutha made the one connection she needed to start her journey.

But all three can be found in the companies that hire as their yoga teacher. Rebecca is on a mission to nourish the minds and bodies of corporate America, one downward-facing dog at a time. But her career path wasn’t always clear to her. Rebecca first experienced the transformative power of yoga in high school, where a favorite teacher led the class through breathing exercises each morning. The mental and physical benefits of that simple ritual inspired her to learn more. Through high school and into college, Rebecca practiced every day, studying the history and methodology of the practice. Soon, Rebecca found that her love for yoga was stronger than her interest in history or writing – the careers she she’d pursue. I felt like I was leading a double life. I was going to school and learning one thing, but that no longer captured my attention and passion, now that I had discovered something so much richer. After college, Rebecca went home to San Francisco to pursue her real moonshot: a full-time career as a yoga instructor. At first, she struggled to differentiate herself in an overcrowded market. Unwilling to give up her dream, she invested in further training and research, building her knowledge of the practice. Slowly, Rebecca started to attract a following. She used her LinkedIn profile to display her credentials and experience. Studio owners not only took notice – they hired her. She connected with her new students on LinkedIn, keeping them updated on her schedule. After attending several of Rebecca’s sessions, a student sent a message asking for private sessions at her workplace. That single message changed the course of Rebecca’s career. Her student’s company, impressed with Rebecca’s background and qualifications, hired Rebecca as their yoga teacher. As she began leading sessions for employees, she found a new purpose: To adapt the physical and mental benefits of yoga to corporate life. Today, Rebecca’s corporate client roster is nearly full with companies like Asana, Sprinklr, and SB Architects. She not only teaches classes, but also conducts team-building and relaxation retreats. And she’s starting to train new teachers, certifying instructors to meet the overwhelming demand for her services. It’s a passion. It’s a hustle. It’s the amount of loving hours you put into it that really sets you apart. Rebecca harnessed her passion and followed her ambition to bring something she loved to an audience who really needed it.

With one bold move, Joel set a new direction for his career in the wine business. It all started with an unusual creative concept for a wine brand.

At a certain point, you’ll need to develop both to succeed. But how? In our latest series on LinkedIn, “Mind the Skills Gap,” we asked some of the world’s most successful business leaders to reveal the skills they’re honing in 2016. In addition to mastering hard skills such as public speaking and coding, 50+ Influencers say they are also cultivating softer skills, such as self-awareness, positivity, humility, empathy, and even the ability to find work-life balance. From Richard Branson to Shark Tank’s Robert Herjavec and GM’s Mary Barra, find out when these top minds in business first acknowledged they could do better, and how they've developed realistic plans for improvement. What’s the one skill you plan to learn (or refine) this year? Discuss your strategies for improvement, and how you plan to reach the next level. Write your own post ; be sure to use somewhere in the body of your post. Here are some of the skills that Influencers are focusing on this year. What about you? On Necker Island, works with a tennis coach to improve his backhand. By focusing on recovery, early preparation, confidence, and practice, the Virgin Group founder is perfecting his strokes the same way he has developed a winning strategy in business: “A key lesson that applies far beyond tennis is to treat each point separately. Forget the last mistake and move onto the next challenge.” — Richard Branson Part of Mary Barra’s job as the CEO of General Motors Company is to coach future leaders. In grooming the next generation, however, Barra has noticed this: “The word ‘feedback’ can trigger ‘fight, flight or freeze’ instincts. Substituting ‘advice’ for ‘feedback’ can make coaching more impactful.” Other than being willing to offer honest advice, that Barra has developed over the years. The president of Eurasia Group recalls spending “nine years, three degrees, and a Cold War” learning Russian. Looking back, all the energy he spent mastering another language may have been for naught. “Though I studied Russian for many years, my Russian skills have atrophied over time,” . “What remains is the insight I gathered into the mentality, familiarizing myself with how other people in the world live by interacting with them directly.” As Bremmer points out, technology (i.e. Google Translate) may help reduce language barriers in the future, but the world will still need people who can navigate cultural barriers. His advice? “Learn cultures, not languages. Study other points of view. The more you know about different regions of the world, the better off you are.” — Ian Bremmer of ABC’s “Shark Tank” used to believe that entrepreneurs had to be paranoid in order to succeed. As someone who used to imagine worst-case scenarios, Herjavec says he is now resolving to ask instead, “What’s the best that can happen?” “My best business decisions have been made when I’ve leaned in, taken the leap outside of my comfort zone and been fueled by a positive focus.” — Robert Herjavec Of all the traits that can derail careers, says selfish behavior is the primary culprit: “Rarely do I see a career ruined due to the lack of 'hard skills.' More often than not, when a career goes south, it is an issue of self — self-absorption, self-interested, or self-serving... I have seen people get hurt, teams unravel and critical initiatives fail all because of one person’s self-centered posturing.” In outlining three ways you can change your behavior, Patton describes the greatest skill you can ever learn: the art of selflessness. Is he right?

The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: . The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to peer operating results. In November 2014, the company issued $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes. In accordance with GAAP, the company separately accounted for the value of the conversion feature as a debt discount, which is amortized in a manner that reflects the company’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, the company recognizes imputed interest expense on its convertible senior notes of approximately 4.7% in its statement of operations. The company excludes the difference between the imputed interest expense and coupon interest expense, net of any capitalized interest, because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. . The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. These adjustments represent the changes in fair value of the cash settlement feature for the preferred shares in the company's joint venture. This non-GAAP adjustment is the result of the company's modified retrospective adoption in the fourth quarter of 2015 of authoritative guidance on derivatives and hedges. The company excludes these fair value adjustments because they are non-cash in nature and the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. . The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by considering the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company uses a static non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected 10-year weighted average non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect the company's long-term operations. Based on the company's current forecast, a tax rate of 23% has been applied to its non-GAAP financial results for the current period. This rate will be adjusted annually, if necessary. The company believes that adjusting for these income tax effects and adjustments provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from its non-GAAP net income. During periods with a net loss, the company excludes certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Trended Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in the company’s earnings release, available at . This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP EPS guidance to net loss or GAAP EPS guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or GAAP provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net loss and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. As items that impact net loss are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net loss is not available without unreasonable effort."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn for Good"],"author":"Lisa Gunnarsson","title":"Helping newly settled refugees find economic opportunity in Sweden","date":"February 15, 2016","content":"LinkedIn’s vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. It’s this vision that makes me proud to work for LinkedIn, especially when it can help an important global issue: the refugee crisis. Last October, a friend who works at the Swedish Migration Board shared with me some of the challenges refugees face as they enter the country and look for employment. These challenges include no local professional network, a language barrier, the nuances of a new culture, and of course, knowing where to find a job. We quickly realized that LinkedIn had a unique opportunity to leverage what our company does best: connect these individuals - many of whom are highly skilled - with opportunity. On a per capita basis, Sweden has received more refugees than any other European country. In addition, many of these refugees have skills that the Swedish economy can benefit. According to , a quarter of refugees in 2014 had higher education — up almost 5% on the previous year. More than two-thirds of them had skills that matched graduate job vacancies. Today, we are very proud to launch , a new initiative that aims to help refugees in Sweden find opportunities created specifically for them and their unique circumstances. The site includes resources in both Arabic and English, including potential opportunities and information on how to create an effective LinkedIn profile. There is also a section for employers that explains how to to post internships and jobs on LinkedIn, at no cost, for refugees. Employers simply mark their internships and job opportunities with a special hashtag, #welcometalent, so they can be easily discovered by refugees. To date there are more than 150 opportunities from companies such as Spotify, Proffice, 3 and Happyr. If you work in Sweden, please consider joining us . If you’re a newly settled refugee, either in Sweden or anywhere in the world, to help find opportunity, no matter where you are."},{"post_categories":["Influencers","Featured"],"author":"Amy Chen","title":"What big ideas will disrupt 2016? Top minds share their predictions","date":"December 16, 2015","content":"The end of the year is a time for quiet reflection — and bold predictions about the year ahead. In our latest LinkedIn series, “Big Ideas 2016,” we asked Influencers to predict the top trends that will shape the coming year. From Arianna Huffington and GM’s Mary Barra to Pandora’s Tim Westergren and Kaiser Permanente’s Bernard Tyson, here’s what 80+ Influencers say is on the horizon for auto, education, entertainment, healthcare, oil and energy, technology, and other key industries. Name the one innovation, social cause, business shift or event that you believe will define 2016. Tell us: What problem will be solved, or what industry will be disrupted by your Big Idea? ; be sure to use somewhere in the body of your piece. Here are some of the top trends to watch in 2016. What are the trends you’ll be tracking? A self-described “sleep evangelist,” predicts that more companies will recognize that “right now we’re in the middle of a sleep deprivation crisis, with devastating effects on our health, our job performance, our relationships, and our happiness.” (Huffington would know; the president and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post Media Group once collapsed from sleep deprivation.) Will you join the “sleep revolution” of 2016? Musicians could be next to get a piece of the on-demand economy, predicts. Dubbing 2016 the “year of the gig economy,” Westergren envisions building a pipeline for music artists: “With the right execution, we could create a musicians' middle class, just as Lyft has created a new set of professional drivers and Etsy a slew of independent online retail shopkeepers.” Beyond music, what other industries might benefit from joining the gig economy? Female founders are shaking up businesses. Here’s what , the CEO of Ellevest, expects to see in this new age of entrepreneurship: More women finding their entrepreneurial spirit later in life, more sources of funding for women entrepreneurs, the creation of more “modern, people-friendly work environments,” and a major shift in mindset: “[There is] a growing recognition that it’s not just one or two or three female entrepreneurs who can be successful, as in the old days of one-seat-at-the-table-for-a-woman in corporate America. Instead, there is room for the pie to grow and for us lift each other up.” — Sallie Krawcheck Virtual reality, especially when paired with live streaming, will be the biggest game changer in 2016, says , the CEO of Mandalay Entertainment and owner of the Golden State Warriors. In this new universe, “a director or producer isn’t determining what you’re looking at, how you’re looking at it, or when you’re looking at it...” “Rather than being a mere passenger, the result is a participatory experience with a far deeper level of emotional engagement than any other curated event can deliver.” Peter Guber We've fallen in love with big data, but 2016 will see the return of human insights — at least if has a say in it. In reflecting on his time in Iraq commanding a Special Operations Task Force, McChrystal recalls how his team helped solve the data overload by running a 90-minute daily “Operations & Intelligence” meeting. At the end of the day, McChrystal found “[a] useful refrain was: this is happened, this is it matters, and we should take this action. We used this phrase to drive home the fact that the ‘why’ matters just as much, if not more, than the ‘what.’” What other areas might benefit from having more human filters?

Your career, family, personal accomplishment, whatever the case may be, you want to unlock its potential. As you progress, or regress, towards that greatness, there are things in your life that you probably attribute to your progression, and in the same breath things that you blame for any regression. If you already attribute your success to your genetic makeup, well then good for you. Reality is, most people either see their genes as having little impact on their success or they blame them for any shortcomings they may have. But what if you were told that the power to create the existence you desire for yourself, for the current world, and the future world, all resided within you? In the latest LinkedIn Speaker Series, we were honored to have join LinkedIn’s VP of Leadership and Organizational Development, , to discuss Deepak’s new book, . Deepak Chopra is the founder of the Chopra Foundation and an internationally known expert in the field of mind-body healing. In , Deepak explores how our genetic makeup isn’t entirely out of our control. As we strive to perform at high levels, it’s important to know that we are not living predetermined lives, destined to only be an expression of things we have no control over. On the contrary, we have control over how our minds and bodies react to various situations. The choices we make have genetic consequences that will influence us now, and also future generations. Perhaps you find yourself doing, or even thinking, something that might not help your end goal. You may view these thoughts and behaviors as a result of how you’re wired, with no remedy other than to deal with it. But it can actually be influenced by the decisions you make. Decisions like the choices we make about food, water, movement, rest, a mindfulness practice, or the way in which we respond outwardly to the people and stimuli we encounter. When we engage in behaviors that are with our nature; when we experience thoughts of compassion, equanimity, love, joy, empathy, or peace, we become equipped with our natural ability to thrive. Conversely, when our behaviors go against our nature, and we experience fear, hostility, guilt, shame, anger, anxiety, or mistrust, we no longer are able to thrive, but instead enter a state of distress and ultimately wither. When we think about accomplishing our goals, there is no doubt that we all wish to the thriving, and not wilting. As Deepak says in his conversation with Fred, it begins with awareness, moves to intention, and then to action. Our responsibility is to think, speak, and act in a way that is aligned with our purpose. When thoughts, words, and actions are aligned with our purpose our inherent greatness will flourish. So what does that mean? There was one line during the talk that really connected it for me. The statement being that every experience has a biological correlate, and the question being, “Are you aware?” The more aware I am of all my experiences, and in turn my biological response to those experiences, the greater my chances of understanding my purpose and exhibiting the behaviors that will set me up for success. below, or , and learn more about how you can unlock the inherent power that exists within you."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Lists","Featured"],"author":"Daniel Roth","title":"We Ranked LinkedIn’s Best Writers of 2015.

As with all , Top Voices is a combination of data and editorial signals. We relied on a formula that measured a host of criteria to determine writers who were making a mark in their industries: engagement around content (especially comments, which — thanks to a lack of anonymity on LinkedIn — are unusually strong); growth of followers tied to publishing; number of times the writer had been featured in a channel in their area of expertise; and how often the contributor had been chosen as an Editors' Pick. That last channel is reserved for top content that helps explain the world today; when editors on my team , they are signaling that a story is worth paying attention to right now.

Don’t fear, we’ve put together some guidelines to make sure you’re putting your best foot forward at your company holiday party. Showing up to the holiday party is a clear sign that you value your company and your colleagues, so save the date on your calendar. Sure, you can wear something fancy and festive. Just keep in mind this is still a work event so dress appropriately. You want the conversation to focus on what you have to say rather than what you’re wearing. If the dress code is not on the invitation, ask the organizers. First things first, make sure you can invite a guest to the party. If you do bring someone to the party, bring someone who makes you feel comfortable, someone who brings out the best in you so you can be yourself with your colleagues. Get to the party within 15 minutes of the start time as it shows respect to the organizers. A few people will already be there so you can easily strike up a conversation right when you walk in the door.

Take advantage of the more informal environment to get to know your colleagues personally. Steer clear of deadlines and projects at work.

Show interest in what others are saying, be gracious and thank your colleagues for their hard work. And while you’re on LinkedIn looking up people you should meet at the holiday party, don’t forget to and interests for potential topics of conversation.

In our latest series on LinkedIn, “Be the Boss,” established names such as Richard Branson and Suze Orman reflect on their entrepreneurial journeys. We also hear from more reluctant entrepreneurs, such as Gimlet Media’s Alex Blumberg, who writes: “You who may not think of yourself as ‘boss material’ or as someone who could succeed in, (and enjoy!), a leadership role. I was like you. I had to be pushed into it. And maybe you could be like me: a leader-in-waiting, prepared to flourish in that new role.” Whether you’re trying to strike out on your own or advance to the next level, what does it take to “be the boss” of your career? ; be sure to use somewhere in the body of your piece. Here's how some Influencers have found success working and thinking like an entrepreneur: No one knows what it takes to strike out on your own like Richard Branson. And yet the billionaire founder of the Virgin Group acknowledges that “going it alone is a romantic notion; few entrepreneurs ever make it without a lot of help.” , every company needs two types of bosses: managers and leaders. “Entrepreneurs must quickly acknowledge what they are good at, and learn to delegate what they are not so good at to great managers.” “Where managers keep the rules, leaders have to be willing to break them, or at least find creative ways around them…” — Richard Branson Which one are you? When Suze Orman reflects on her career, she can pinpoint the defining moment when she became “the boss.” On the heels of a best-selling book, the personal finance expert was met with not-so-subtle resistance when pitching her next idea, The Courage to Be Rich: “One after another, some of the most brilliant minds in publishing said, ‘That's a horrible title. It doesn't take courage to be rich; it takes courage to be poor.’” Orman could have easily caved and deferred to the sentiment in that room, but instead : “‘Obviously you are not the right publisher for this book.’” The moment she walked out of the room, something changed in how Orman perceived herself. (Her third book, “The Courage to Be Rich,” would go on to sell more than one million copies in hardback.) “Along with all my successes, I also have had many failures. But being the boss means you look at those failures as lessons you needed to learn to be even more successful in the next venture you try.” — Suze Orman “There are plenty of reasons why people make excuses not to start their own business — I’ve heard them all,” of ABC's “Shark Tank.” Of all the excuses he has heard, however, these are by far the top three: “Now isn't the right time,” “I'm not prepared to run a business,” and “I'm afraid to fail.” If any of these excuses sound familiar to you, remember this: “Failure can be embarrassing, but if you never try, all you will end up with is regret.” — Robert Herjavec If there were ever a reluctant boss, Alex Blumberg would be it. “Boss. The word was loaded. I thought being a boss meant being doubt-free and authoritative, the last words anyone would use to describe me,” . At the urging of a friend/business partner, however, Blumberg co-founded Planet Money in 2008. As that podcast grew to become the No. 1 business podcast on iTunes, Blumberg says he also grew into being a boss. In fact, the once-reluctant boss is now well into his next venture as the CEO and co-founder of Gimlet Media: “Turns out being a boss was nothing like what I’d anticipated. Qualities I considered my weaknesses were in fact assets once I was running my own team.” — Alex Blumberg After 20 years of growing her small business into a 2,000-person company, . The founder and CMO of Angie’s List now holds weekly office hours for her employees as a way to “capture and funnel good ideas… Proposals have included a way to increase call-center efficiency during low-volume periods, how to stretch our supply dollars with a paper reuse plan, and more.” Where did your last great idea come from? *** In the coming weeks, we’ll feature more posts from Influencers and LinkedIn members who reveal how they work and think like an entrepreneur.

You should treat every relationship with respect, and while it’s OK to disagree with someone, do it gracefully. In today’s highly connected world, I believe this advice is more important than ever. I’m certainly not the only one who has benefited from advice from my parents. I asked some of my colleagues about the best piece of career advice they received from their parents, and this is what they had to say: In college, Head of LinkedIn for Good ’s dad would always tell her to choose the greatest professor rather than the most compelling class. After all, it is the teacher, not the subject, that teaches us how to think and be an inquisitive and engaging member of society. Meg has extended this advice to her career - and has looked for great leaders and managers rather than perfect jobs. And it is these individuals who have challenged her to stretch and be more productive and successful. Authenticity keeps you grounded. Know where your center is, keep to it and build on that core with more knowledge. ’s mom shared this advice with her when she was deciding whether to change majors in college. Mariama started out majoring in accounting because she was ok with numbers, the career path seemed secure and somewhat lucrative, but she didn't enjoy it and her performance suffered as a result. She’s now working in our Talent Acquisition organization and could not be happier. Her mom’s advice has stuck with her every step of her career, even in daily interactions. Every time a new opportunity presents itself, she stops to ask whether it will keep her engaged and excited so she can put her best foot forward. Engineering leader ’s parents supported five children in pursuing their passions, regardless of how crazy they might have sounded e.g., \"I'm going to be a street performer\". Their careers have ranged from Michael’s as a software engineering leader to a social worker, a nationally recognized tennis coach, a restaurant owner, and a . With this wisdom from her parents, Sales Leader was free from thinking that decisions were final, and that she was only allowed to make good choices in life. She used to be concerned that she wouldn't always make the right decisions in life (pick the right job, break up or stay together with my boyfriend, etc.), but her parents always reminded her that we are allowed to make as many choices as necessary to get our lives just right. This simple advice has helped her throughout her life to pursue the things that interested but also scared her, whether that was living abroad, taking a sabbatical, getting married, or deciding to join a new company. Even when her decisions haven't always been \"right,\" she remembers her parents’ advice and is free to make new decisions, to choose a different path if that's what's needed, and to keep making decisions until she gets her life just right. , our Global Employee Experience Manager, was always taught by her mom to not be afraid of rejection, the word no, or putting herself out there to ask a question or try something new. This belief has allowed MaryAnne to stay confident in any situation, to take rejection as an opportunity rather than a setback. It has led her to explore various opportunities and ultimately helped her grow in passions both professionally and personally. My colleague on the communications team saw his father live this advice every day. ​Tenacity and hard graft were at the core of Darain’s father's work ethic, and when he didn't know what he wanted to do after college, his dad reassured him that being determined and focused is ultimately what will will see you through. For as long as Social Media Manager could remember, this had been her father’s mantra. He learned this by asking \"why did so-and-so get fired?\" throughout his career. Liana now understands that a bad attitude is rarely the trigger for firing someone, but it's often the underlying reason for poor performance (one exception: not having the right skills to perform the job). Being successful at your job is as much about being a proactive problem solver and being a pleasure to work with as it is about being good at your daily responsibilities. When Nonprofit Relationship Manager ’s dad was 16, he left his family in Iran for a new life in the U.S. One of his first jobs was as a Math Teacher at Queens College in NY, where he began to build his roots in this country. He always believed that with the right mindset, resources, and conviction, there is a way to solve every problem, both inside and outside of the classroom. This belief has formed the way Ariana sees the world and approaches challenges; it's what's given her the ability to see answers in the midst of complexity and the confidence to press on even in the most seemingly-difficult situations. The best advice ’s parents ever gave him wasn't actually something they told him, it was the advice that they SHOWED him by the way they lived. Kyle’s parents are nice to everyone, and they make friends wherever they go. They smile at people, talk to them, ask them about themselves, and treat everyone they meet with love and respect. They have taught him that the worth of each and every person he meets is immeasurable. This has enabled him to experience the joy that comes through serving and befriending those he comes in contact with. What’s the best career advice you’ve received from your parents?

He’s always been my favorite “dragon.” He’s never shy of sharing how he made millions, yet it’s his warm, approachable, and down-to-earth personality that inspires all who listen. James shared multiple stories that hit home for me and I wanted to share the three lessons that left a lasting impression: At 16-years-old, James left home with nothing but the clothes he was wearing, determined to go and face life on his own. Although he was a young man, he wasn’t afraid to take risks. “A risk is only a risk if you don’t understand it -- it’s calculated once you understand it.” James emphasized the importance of defining what that risk really is and how far too often, the obvious choice is what we tend not to do. It made me think about why so often we don’t take those risks and fail to follow our guts. But James is an excellent example of what can happen when you listen to it...investments and risks can pay off. Even though James has made millions from his ventures he says, “I’m weak on numbers and don’t know how to work a spreadsheet. I surround myself with people who have that skill set and it makes me look good.” As someone who’s not the best at math, it’s a great reminder and motivator, that your weaknesses don’t have to be the demise of your goals. If a man who has created 28,000 businesses, 41,000 new jobs, and is worth millions accepts his weakness, so I shall too! His catchphrase: What does that mean? James says the most dangerous behavior to have is to just nod in acceptance when you’re not sure what is being communicated. So instead, he asks this question over and over again until he’s clear. Even as simple as it may sound, most people continue nodding in fear of showing vulnerability. What will others think about us? What will they say? Will they question our ability to be a leader? A visionary? I challenge you to try and ask, “So what does that mean?” Even with these three lessons still fresh in my memory, James left us with two pieces of fatherly wisdom passed down to him, “Observe the masses and do the opposite,” and “Always look for opportunities where both parties benefit.” Here’s to taking risks, surrounding yourself with strength, and never just nodding."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News"],"author":"Steve Sordello","title":"LinkedIn's Q3 2015 Earnings","date":"October 29, 2015","content":" Today, we reported our financial results for the third quarter 2015. LinkedIn achieved strong performance across all three product lines during the quarter. We remain focused on pursuing long-term investments to achieve future growth and increased profitability. Also, just this week, EY and LinkedIn entered into the largest customer deal in our history LEVERAGING THE Sales Navigator platform, which includes a go-to-market alliance that will help us accelerate our growth in the B2B market. I highly encourage you to review , including our GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation. [1] I will co-host a with our CEO to discuss our financial results for the third quarter 2015 and business outlook today at 2:00PM Pacific Time. See slides below. This post contains non-GAAP financials measures relating to the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures at and additional details regarding the use of non-GAAP measures below. This post also contains forward-looking statements about our products, including our investments in products, technology and other key strategic areas, certain non-financial metrics, such as customer and member growth and engagement, and our expected financial metrics such as revenue, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP EPS, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and fully-diluted weighted shares for the fourth quarter of 2015 and the full fiscal year 2015. The achievement of the matters covered by such forward-looking statements involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, the company’s results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements the company makes. The risks and uncertainties referred to above include - but are not limited to - risks associated with: our limited operating history in a new and unproven market; engagement of our members; the price volatility of our Class A common stock; general economic conditions; expectations regarding the return on our strategic investments; execution of our plans and strategies, including with respect to mobile products and features and expansion into new areas and businesses; security measures and the risk that they may not be sufficient to secure our member data adequately or that we are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of members to access our solutions; expectations regarding our ability to timely and effectively scale and adapt existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that our solutions are accessible at all times with short or no perceptible load times; our ability to maintain our rate of revenue growth and manage our expenses and investment plans; our ability to accurately track our key metrics internally; members and customers curtailing or ceasing to use our solutions; our core value of putting members first, which may conflict with the short-term interests of the business; privacy, security and data transfer concerns, as well as changes in regulations, which could impact our ability to serve our members or curtail our monetization efforts; litigation and regulatory issues; increasing competition; our ability to manage our growth; our international operations; our ability to recruit and retain our employees; the application of U.S. and international tax laws on our tax structure and any changes to such tax laws; acquisitions we have made or may make in the future; and the dual class structure of our Class A common stock. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company’s financial results is included in filings it makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and additional information will also be set forth in our Form 10-Q that will be filed for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, which should be read in conjunction with these financial results. These documents are or will be available on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Relations page of the company's website at . All information provided is as of October 29, 2015, and LinkedIn undertakes no duty to update this information. . To supplement its condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: . The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to peer operating results. In November 2014, the company issued $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes. In accordance with GAAP, the company separately accounted for the value of the conversion feature as a debt discount, which is amortized in a manner that reflects the company’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, the company recognizes imputed interest expense on its convertible senior notes of approximately 4.7% in its statement of operations. The company excludes the difference between the imputed interest expense and coupon interest expense, net of any capitalized interest, because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. . The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. . The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by considering the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, the company has implemented a static non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected 10-year weighted average non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect the company's long-term operations. Historically, the company computed a non-GAAP tax rate based on non-GAAP pre-tax income on a quarterly basis. Based on the company's current forecast, a tax rate of 23% has been applied to its non-GAAP financial results for the current period. This rate will be adjusted annually, if necessary. The company believes that adjusting for these income tax effects and adjustments provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from its non-GAAP net income. During periods with a net loss, the company excluded certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Trended Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in company’s earnings release, which is available at the investor relations portion of its website at . This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP EPS guidance to net loss or GAAP EPS guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or GAAP provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net loss and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. As items that impact net loss are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net loss is not available without unreasonable effort."},{"post_categories":["Privacy"],"author":"Sara Harrington","title":"LinkedIn's Transparency Report about Government Requests for Member Data: First Half of 2015","date":"October 15, 2015","content":"At LinkedIn, our members are our top priority.

Today we've published the latest installment of LinkedIn’s , summarizing government requests for member account data we received from January through June 2015. We publish this report twice a year to keep members informed of how often law enforcement and other government officials serve LinkedIn with subpoenas or court orders for member data, and how LinkedIn responds to such data requests. : We received 112 requests from 7 countries (Bulgaria, Canada, France, India, Spain, UK and the U.S.) in this reporting period, seeking information pertaining to 161 member accounts.

For example, my roommate has experience working inside Yale's admissions office. Could he counsel and coach high school seniors? Or my friend who knows exactly for any occasion. Could she take side gigs as a makeup artist? Even my dad, who has taken some of my most viral social media photos (thanks, dad!) could, potentially, freelance as a photographer. While these are my own personal observations, there's obviously a much bigger economic and political discussion underway right now about freelancing. With this in mind, we began to examine the freelance economy from a LinkedIn perspective and surfaced some interesting initial insights: We began by focusing on LinkedIn members with the word “freelance” in their job title, and then we aggregated the most common industries and skill sets found (chart follows). The top results range from media and communications, to engineering and software development. Of the most popular industries, \"Arts & Design\" clearly comes out on top with roughly 46% of total freelancers on LinkedIn. And these freelancers don’t just work in traditional fine arts and industries. They're also illustrators, makeup artists, and musicians. If you’re considering freelancing in any of these fields, you will be in good company. And if you’re looking to hire in this area, you will have access to a broad range of skill sets on LinkedIn. Our next step was to look at the unique characteristics of freelancers on LinkedIn. On average, our data shows that freelancers juggle roughly 2.1 gigs at once (indicated by members having more than one current role listed on their LinkedIn profile without an end date). With the flexible nature of freelance careers, people can work a full-time job concurrently or juggle multiple freelance gigs at a time—even for different skill sets. Looking at gender, there are also slightly more females than males freelancing which indicates that more women tend to freelance as there are slightly more males on LinkedIn overall. Most importantly, our data shows that . When we compare them to non-freelancing members across the same job functions, freelancers take the lead across the board — they have more recommendations, group memberships, skills listed, endorsements, and connections than average. Looking at this data can help both sides of the gig economy. On one hand, we recommend that people looking to hire leverage their network and their connections’ profile data—from specific skills and endorsements, past experiences, and client recommendations—to find the best match for their projects. On the other hand, the data also shows that regardless of current employment status, many people have relevant skills that are valuable to others. The vision of is to be able to digitally map all aspects of economic activity around the world—people, skills, jobs, companies, schools, and professional knowledge. And data shows that the gig economy is going to have a huge macroeconomic effect on the economy and unemployment—according to the , up to “200 million who are inactive or employed part time could gain additional hours through freelance platforms.” LinkedIn is also starting to explore how we can help connect our members with the right freelance professionals by leveraging the power of our network. This week, LinkedIn began the pilot phase of a new platform, , focused on design, writing/editing, and accounting services in the San Francisco Bay Area. We plan to learn from this test before expanding the experience to other categories and geographies. Ultimately, we hope this data inspires you to think about your marketable skills or perhaps identify areas for ongoing skills development.

Free-range parents. Helicopter dads. But there’s more to parenting than the extremes—and our latest research discovered that many young adults want more involvement than they’re getting As LinkedIn’s approaches, I’ve found myself thinking about all the ways in which my parents supported me growing up. I was lucky that they provided me with countless words of wisdom as I journeyed through education, but that advice tailed off once I started my first job. Looking back, there have been clear moments and milestones in my career when their help would have been useful but I didn’t ask, and they didn’t offer. Whilst it would be useful to talk through certain problems or issues I face in my working life, I don’t want them to become over-involved and our global research shows I’m not alone:   The Lighthouse Parent, as coined by our partner , defines this parenting style as “remaining available for consultation without being overbearing.” She’s examined different parenting styles based on how engaged parents were in their child’s professional life, the types of decisions they helped to influence and how these affected kids that have flown the nest. The Lighthouse Parent joins other parenting styles you might be familiar with: Free Range, Well-wishers, Concierge and Helicopter Parenting. Curious to learn more about these style and which ones you or your parents are? Grab a pen and take the quiz:   Dr. Beauregard commented, “Regardless of style, all parents can take steps to open up a conversation with their adult children about the world of work. The research shows parents know they have advice to offer but hold back from giving it. Emotional support is such a key factor in a child’s success, even after they have flown the nest. By asking targeted questions that require children to explain the work they do, both parties can benefit from hearing different perspectives. The more parents learn about their children's jobs, the more they can ask informed questions and have relevant ideas to contribute to the discussion, without critiquing children's actions or offering unsolicited advice.” Parents are a commonly overlooked network when it comes to building a career. We all know they’ve been there and done that, but they’ve also learned valuable lessons along the way and young adults are hungry for their advice. This research shows there is still a gap in understanding between parents and their kids when it comes to the world of work and there’s an easy way to start: Bring In Your Parents Day. November 5th marks the third year of LinkedIn’s Bring In Your Parents day and we’re asking everyone to get involved.

I can’t help but feel energized by these women who are the driving force behind our employee-led program and who show such inspiring dedication to tackling the gender imbalance in the tech industry.

How do you cope with the pressure to optimize everything? In our latest series on LinkedIn, “Productivity Hacks,” we asked some of the world’s top business leaders to share their systems and strategies for getting more done in less time. Perhaps more importantly, we also learned what some of these Influencers do with all those saved minutes and hours. From kitesurfing (Richard Branson) to more Fridays off to spend with family (Yahoo! Chairman Maynard Webb), it’s clear why many of us work so hard anyway — to carve out the time and energy to do more of what we love. Share your best productivity tip, and tell us how you spend your \"saved\" time. Do you reallocate that energy to family, hobbies, or other projects? ; use somewhere in the body (not the headline) of your piece. How on earth does Richard Branson find time to kitesurf… and play tennis… and ride bikes? By being punctual — both as a sign of respect to others, and so he doesn’t fall hopelessly behind on the rest of his day. However, “[b]eing on time doesn’t mean working to a strict, rigid schedule. It means being an effective delegator, organiser, and communicator,” . The billionaire founder of the Virgin Group also believes that productivity means allowing flexible schedules for his employees. “There’s no need to be in the office to do your best work. By giving your staff the freedom to structure their own time, you will empower them to work more creatively and effectively.” — Richard Branson Like many professionals, found herself wading through emails first thing in the morning. Then she developed an email system that follows these two rules: “Email is best done in bulk” and “Email is best done when you have less energy, not more.” That said, the early Twitter employee acknowledges that she is indeed human: “I regularly get off track. I’ll wake in the middle of the night unexpectedly, and grab my iPhone for a minute that turns into 20.” (You have to wonder: Were we all a bit more productive pre-smartphone?) must be doing something right as the executive chairman of the board at Marriott International. While he relies on his assistant of nearly 30 years, the octogenarian also believes in getting some work done the old-fashioned way: [Picking up the phone] really is the easiest and quickest way to get responses from people in the office… Social media is not the only way to have a conversation.” — Bill Marriott cuts straight to the heart of the productivity dilemma when he asks: “Have you ever crossed off everything on your list and still felt like you had not really accomplished anything?” Instead of offering up just another to-do list, the motivational speaker suggests this three-part “system of thinking.” Robbins also points out: “To continue to manage your life by a to-do list only invites the continuing imbalance and frustration that comes from knowing you’re working hard, but that you’re not making progress in all the areas of your life that truly matter. Working harder is not the answer.” — Tony Robbins In an endless quest for productivity, EY’s reflects on the time he was excelling at work — but not necessarily at home. While on a business trip, an unexpectedly candid conversation with his wife served as his (literal) wake-up call: “She told me that I had become so consumed by the pace of this growth endeavor that I was neglecting my commitments to her and our children.” After jumping on a plane to repair the damage at home, Patton says he now asks these three questions to help him never lose sight of his priorities and purpose again. Freelance journalist might be a kindred spirit: “I am not productive. In fact, sometimes I waste entire days,” she confesses. Then again, McLean points out: “I’m not sure journalism is meant to be quantifiably productive. You need to call everyone, even people who hang up on you, because if you don’t, you’re not doing your job. You need to spend hours talking to people because it’s as important to understand what you don’t use and why you don’t use it as it is to understand what you do use.” Given all the jobs out there that don’t lend themselves to easy measures of productivity, McLean may be onto something...

This is especially true when you have to change an industrial mindset that has established and maintained its rigid structure for centuries. It requires painful introspection, grueling self-reflection, and salesmanship to convince others of your discovery. But most of all, it requires a leader to step forward. Between 2003-2008, served as the commander the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), an organization encompassing the US military’s most elite units. Facing an unorganized, chaotic enemy the traditional military wasn’t trained to engage, McChrystal was forced to be this leader. On August 20, McChrystal and his co-author, former Navy SEAL Team 6 member , joined LinkedIn’s co-founder Reid Hoffman to discuss this process of adapting to a new environment as expressed in their new book, Team of Teams. The beauty of McChrystal’s experience in Iraq lies in his applicable ideals. His thought-process in Iraq mirrors the same ingenuity, preparedness, and readiness to adapt as the most innovative and successful companies in our industry. As Reid stated, “You have to be constantly reinventing yourself and investing in the future.” Such is true about tech, and such is true about fighting a war. Although hard to imagine, McChrystal and Fussell conveyed important values that transcend industry, company, and function. The following three lessons from the LinkedIn Speaker Series resonated with me profoundly: McChrystal could only describe the US military as “excellent.” Yet, he realized being excellent at one’s job and even winning every battle doesn’t necessarily result in winning the war. As McChrystal recounts, the most elite units in the world were winning, but the team was losing. “Each of our teams was excellent…but I see we are losing.” McChrystal reflected, “[The teams] are working, but cumulatively they are not.” He and Fussell understood that success required a conceptual understanding of the bigger picture, and even if intermediary steps were proving to be successful, the larger, strategic goal is all that matters. McChrystal realized he had to change the communicative interaction between the seemingly siloed teams spread across the globe. He enacted a mandatory daily video conference between all the teams so they could understand the bigger picture during the war. In essence, this is the same technique technology companies employ. Company “All-Hands” meetings unite employees all over the globe to alert them of the company’s goals, strategic plans, and a project’s progress. Just as our CEO Jeff Weiner conveys his vision in LinkedIn’s meetings, McChrystal established an outlet for each deployed team to understand the chaotic atmosphere in Iraq. It also allowed each team to understand the role they played on the global stage and learn from the entrepreneurial thinking and insights of others. This network connectivity proved to be an invaluable tool in the war as it proves to be invaluable in our industry. An understanding of the need for change is important, but it ultimately requires leadership to enact it. Technology and network connections are merely ingredients to achieve success, but leadership is the driving force that uses those tools. As McChrystal advises, “You have to use the digital tools you have to inspire and to instruct.” Sometimes, the biggest leadership step to undertake is simply committing the idea that you need to change. McChrystal freely admits, “I didn’t know what we had to change to, I simply knew that the status quo was failing.” Essentially, when you’re failing, any decision to change is a good decision. McChrystal and Fussell’s remarkable insights demonstrate that value can be derived from even the most chaotic and seemingly unrelated scenarios. Through thorough analysis, self-questioning, and action-oriented leadership, McChrystal rearranged the traditional structure of the US military’s Special Ops units to make them more efficient. Ultimately, we must ask ourselves in everything we do, “Are we succeeding in our mission?” And if not, we mustn’t be afraid to change even the most well-established norms."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Lists","Featured"],"author":"Daniel Roth","title":"Introducing LinkedIn Next Wave: Top Professionals 35 and Under Changing the Way We Do Business","date":"September 8, 2015","content":"Today's entrepreneurs, inventors and company builders don't fit a stereotype.

The author of the story, , wrote, “The more that audacious coders dream of changing the world, the more they need to fill their companies with social alchemists who can connect with customers—and make progress seem pleasant.” With this in mind, we looked at LinkedIn data to understand the prevalence of these “social alchemists” with liberal arts degrees joining the tech workforce. We defined “liberal arts” as the humanities, social sciences, natural/physical sciences, and theoretical math. As our data shows, liberal arts grads are joining the tech workforce more rapidly than technical grads. Between 2010 and 2013, the growth of liberal arts majors entering the technology industry from undergrad outpaced that of computer science and engineering majors by 10%. Internet or software companies are especially popular—38% of all recent liberal arts grads in tech currently work in this space. Given these growing trends, we looked into the data and uncovered three insights that can help liberal arts grads understand where their expertise fits within the technology industry. These days you find liberal arts grads all across the technology industry. While sales and marketing still make up the majority of liberal arts degree holders in tech, the . These results reveal that the philosophy behind liberal arts, which encourages diversity of skills and flexible critical thinking, transfers to the workplace in various forms. Where you went to college plays a part in whether your liberal arts degree lands you a job in tech. On average, about 10% of all recent liberal arts grads go into tech directly from undergrad; but for students graduating from the —the average is 14%. However, you don’t need to attend an Ivy League school to make your liberal arts degree work for you in the long run. When we broke down the percent of recent liberal arts grads in tech by top 20, (those not included in the top 20), and non-top 100 schools, we found that the difference between each tier is about 1% or less. Having full-time work experience gives liberal arts grads a better shot of finding a tech job, irrespective of industry. An earlier Economic Graph analysis shows that half of the are tech-related. Compared to liberal arts majors directly from college, the average percent of liberal arts grads going into tech after having just one other job is already 4% higher. While we still see slight difference with pedigree, the overall picture is brighter for all liberal arts majors with experience.

LinkedIn Speaker Series With Professor Robert D. Putnam","date":"August 26, 2015","content":"Having a home full of books and a mother who was a teacher led me to love reading from an early age. When I was in kindergarten, my hand always shot up when my teachers asked for volunteers to read out loud. I vividly remember feeling confident and wanting to read more, a positive cycle that helped me succeed through school. Fast forward to adulthood, and I realize that I was set up for success at a very young age, an opportunity many kids never have. I recently had the opportunity to hear Professor Robert D. Putnam, author of ” speak with Reid Hoffman at our LinkedIn Speaker Series. Professor Putnam spoke about the widening opportunity gap between “rich” and “poor” children. His research shows that “rich” kids come from homes with at least one college-educated parent, whereas “poor” kids often lack parents with college educations. “Rich” kids have significantly more access to extracurricular activities, high-quality schools, and healthy networks. “Poorer” kids, on the other hand, have little to no access to those same benefits, and this trend is increasing with time. These kids also lack what he calls “social airbags,” the basic layers of protection more affluent kids have to prevent life-changing mistakes. To put some of this into perspective, Putnam highlighted that reading to children at an early age is a huge indicator of whether or not they’ll achieve academic success. Children from lower-income families, however, may not have parents to read to them. The parent might spend much of their mental energy and time on figuring out how to put food on the table and pay the rent. “How can one expect a parent to make the time to read to their child if basic needs like food and shelter are barely being met?” At the same time this is happening, there are wealthier families providing any and everything to their children; nannies, daycare, preschool, bedtime reading, etc. The success gap has already widened significantly by the time kindergarten has commenced: the low-income child is already playing catch-up, while the affluent kid is on grade-level or even ahead. This gap only worsens with time. Furthermore, highlights that the gap is even wider between poor Whites and poor African-Americans, as the latter group often faces a “double burden” of poverty due to systematic discrimination. Putnam believes that the American dream is broken. How well you do in life should depend on your own hard work and skills, not on what your parents did or whether or not they are successful. While there are significant policy changes that he believes need to be in place (e.g. universal early childhood education), there are ways that you and I can help low-opportunity kids today. They often lack “social navigators:” mentors like you and me to lay a foundation of opportunity for them. Your academic, career, and general life insight is crucial to their success. Volunteer, read to children, become a mentor, share your story and be a role model to others. I’ll be committing to , and I’d like to invite you to do the same. Help these youth access the same opportunities you had when you were younger -- it can transform their lives.

Not only was I excited to meet someone who shared the same college alma mater as me, but to hear how someone turned their curiosity into a thriving business. With a bright smile and cheerful charisma, Alex spoke about how he and his co-founder, Nikhil Arora, veered into their start-up world in a very unusual way. It started in a business ethics class at UC Berkeley. As classmates, both were intrigued when their college professor had mentioned that there was a way to grow mushrooms out of coffee grounds, which happens to be America’s largest, urban street waste. Realizing their similar interests, their professor connected the two students and their curiosity spiked. They voraciously consumed any articles or videos they could get their hands on and soon learned enough to test the theory in Alejandro’s fraternity kitchen. This particular experience produced a single, beautiful crop of mushrooms in which they toted to some of one of the world’s best restaurants and a major retailer, where they were told they had promise. The entire process triggered a new perspective and path for both Alex and Nikhil. They were just a few months shy of graduating and had full time offers into consulting and investment banking. But with the success of their initial meetings, they believed they could expand their mushroom farming into an expanded product line stocked at major grocers and retailers. And with passion and persistence, they did just that. Fast forward six years and their “ready-to-grow” mushroom, basil and cilantro kits have hit shelf space at 14,000 stores, which include some of the biggest names like Target and Whole Foods. What started out as a piece of interesting information transformed into an entire company, all thanks to a little curiosity and not being afraid to raise your hand. After hearing Alex speak, I took away a few key learnings that not only apply to my professional life here at LinkedIn, but also in my personal life. Often times, people come into our lives unexpectedly and go floating by without a second thought. However, it’s the importance of not being afraid to raise your hand and embracing new people that can be the foundation of a great relationship, not to mention something quite rewarding. Alex and his cofounder met unexpectedly after their professors connected them and realized they had mutual interests. We at LinkedIn are constantly meeting new people, whether they are clients, a new coworker or someone at lunch. Although it may not always be a fast “AHA” moment, these relationships are the foundation of the future. Alex’s talk was packed with wisdom and encouragement to take intelligent risks, something that is core to us at LinkedIn. While it’s human to feel the day-to-day redundancy and there are times when it becomes scary to make that next step, Alex’s story reminds us that sometimes we don’t plan on our next adventure, it comes to us unexpectedly and it’s up to us to seize the opportunity.

By analyzing the changes LinkedIn members made to their profiles in 2014, we uncovered geographic migration trends, ebbs and flows of professional talent if you will, that span the globe. We determined the top 20 countries that saw the most migration activity (the absolute number of members moving in and out of a country) and ranked them by their net migration (the number of members arriving to a country minus the number of member departing a country) as a percentage of country membership. The results tell us which countries in 2014 had the most professional migrants in 2014 and the general direction in which they moved - potential indications of economic performance through 2015.  We ran a similar analysis last year that looked at migration trends in 2013, and found the results to be comparable in some instances. For example, the United Arab Emirates trend of growth due to migration continues, with +1.89% more members arriving versus departing in 2014. India and Ireland flip-flopped compared to what we saw last year. Ireland saw a modest net gain of +0.18% in 2014 compared to -0.1% loss in 2013. Conversely, India saw a significant -0.23% loss in 2014 compared to a strong +0.5% gain in 2013.

India was the top country of origin among members who moved to the United Arab Emirates in 2014.

We knew each other well, and of course we knew what the other was working on. But as our team grew, I began to worry more about our employees not knowing each other, and not knowing what everyone else was working on. And I was concerned about the impact this could have on our culture and productivity. That’s why I’m excited to introduce you to -- a new LinkedIn app that makes professionals more productive and successful by helping them easily find, learn about, and contact their coworkers. We discovered in April that about 30 percent of members who search for people on LinkedIn each month view their coworkers’ profiles. We wanted to find out why, so later that month we surveyed 814 professionals in North America about how they use their companies’ intranets. Here’s what we learned: Only 38 percent of professionals said their companies’ intranets are effective at helping them learn about their coworkers. 58 percent said they could do a better job if they could find coworkers with specific skills. In response, people are looking elsewhere to learn about their coworkers. 46 percent say they look up coworkers on LinkedIn. That’s because it’s easier to find coworkers on LinkedIn, and the professional info people add to their profiles is more comprehensive and up-to-date than lots of companies’ intranets. That’s why we developed Lookup. Here’s how it works: Let’s say I recently met a person on our corporate communications team whose input I’d like on a product I’m developing, but I can’t remember her name. No problem! With Lookup I can search for coworkers by name, title, current and past experience, education, and skills. Since she works on our corporate communications team, I enter “Corporate Communications” in the search field, and click “search.” Lookup provides me with the photos, names, and titles of my coworkers whose LinkedIn profiles include the skill or title “corporate communications.” There she is: Julie.  I click on Julie’s profile and Lookup gives me the info that is most relevant to me: her photo, title, work experience, education, top skills, and work email address. I’d be able to see Julie’s info via Lookup even if we weren’t connected on LinkedIn. Lookup also gives me Julie’s mobile number, since she has added her contact preferences to Lookup. Contact preferences that members add to Lookup are only visible to coworkers using the app, and don’t appear on their public LinkedIn profiles. But what if Julie didn’t add her contact preferences to Lookup? I can send an email to her work address directly from Lookup, or send her a message. I simply click “Send a message,” type my message, hit “Send,” and Julie will get an alert on her mobile phone. Lookup users can message coworkers, even if they haven’t downloaded Lookup, and messages sent to coworkers’ LinkedIn inboxes via Lookup don’t count against the number of InMails members get each month.  There’s an old saying: “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.” Unfortunately, these days it’s harder to know your coworkers than it is to know professionals outside your company.

Maybe it was someone you barely knew who shared a piece of advice at exactly the right time?  I have been fortunate to have had many mentors, but one who really stands out is who was the CMO of Yahoo! while I was there. Cammie made me feel smarter than I thought I was - and stretched me to take on new challenges. For those of us whose lives have been shaped by mentors, we know how important these mentoring relationships can be. That’s why we’re asking our members to by @mentioning them in a LinkedIn update, then by volunteering to mentor an underserved youth. This week, we invited LinkedIn members and Influencers to share stories of mentors who've shaped them, and here’s what we learned: Sometimes, it’s not about finding that one perfect mentor who will transform your career. For veteran , Chad’s transition out of the Navy and into the civilian world was not smooth sailing. When he was trying to figure out what it meant to be a leader in the civilian world, rather than try to tell him what leadership was, his mentor Eileen grew with him as a leader. For ABC News correspondent , she never believed in counting on just one person for career guidance. Now a mentor herself, Schiavocampo discovered that she still sometimes grapples with the same issues as her mentees. “Realizing that has helped me approach [mentoring] relationships with more care, not turning to the same mentor excessively, being understanding of the demands of their time and the limitations of their availability.” Despite all the odds against her, hospitality manager was set on getting her Bachelor’s degree even if it took her 12 years to do it. However, she didn’t think she would have made it were it not for who invited her to participate in events around the world that she wouldn’t have been able to attend otherwise. One of the most transformational invitations was when Sandra asked Laura to attend the Women as Global Leaders Conference in Abu Dhabi. On this trip, Laura traveled to and fell in love with Dubai, so much so that she ended up moving there to get her MBA. Long before became the three-term mayor of New York City, he was a young professional just starting out. Fresh out of school, he landed at an investment bank called Salomon Brothers & Hutzler, where he says the managing partner William R. Salomon was “the most ethical person I ever met over the course of my career.” Salomon soon gave the young Bloomberg a crash course on leadership: “I remember when Billy fired a salesman for violating the firm’s ban on gifts. We had a rule: No gifts. Period.” Bloomberg went on to build a company with three ex-Salomon employees, who also internalized Salomon’s principles. When Dylan Dreyer was an aspiring meteorologist, she worked her way up from small markets (Erie, PA) to mid-size markets (Providence, RI). Along the way, she met a well-known New England meteorologist John Ghiorse, who : “He invited me to spend holidays with his family, as I was living in Rhode Island on my own… A mentor and friend is the best combination.” Now the meteorologist for NBC News’ “Weekend TODAY, Dreyer credits hard work, luck, and Ghiorse with getting her where she is today. One of the secret ingredients to a lasting mentor/mentee relationship is . Designer grew up on the Southside of Chicago, and spent his life “racing against the shadows of the distorted perception of Black males from the inner city.” When his mentor Gina “allowed him to feel seen and respected”, for a brief moment, he felt free. Sherry Sims, CEO of Black Women’s Career Network, found that . When Sherry was a recruiter, she had regular meetings with her manager and mentor Jennifer who boosted her confidence with positive feedback and encouraged her to attend trainings to develop as a professional. This inspired Sherry to improve as a professional and gave her the confidence she needed to become the CEO she is today. Those of us who’ve had a mentor in our lives are the lucky ones. found that 1 in 3 young people in the U.S. have never had a mentor of any kind. This is especially disheartening because these relationships can make such a real difference for underserved youth - they are 55% more likely to enroll in college when they have a mentor. Wharton professor Adam Grant dedicated his book, “Give and Take,” to the mentor who personified ” Sadly, Jeff Zaslow never saw the dedication — he died about a year before Grant’s book was published. “Thank your mentor before it’s too late,” Grant writes. “And then light as many candles as you can.” So if your career has been impacted by a mentor, by @mentioning them on LinkedIn with the hashtag #ThankYourMentor. Then, by signing up for an opportunity to mentor an underserved youth and help someone else achieve their career aspirations.

They’ve used the platform to discuss the future of work, the state of their industries, what companies are getting it right and which aren’t and how the professional world can be a better place. Since our earliest prototype, our goal was always to find a way to unlock the incredible insights stuck in the brains and cubicles of professionals like you. We wanted to make it easy for your ideas or lessons — or even just the start of one — to quickly spark a conversation that leaps silos, companies, industries, even countries. We wanted insight to turn into that make an impact. It worked. Want a good example? , our 1 millionth publisher. Sherwani, a service designer at Telefonica in London, had attended the One Young World conference, a gathering of young creative global minds designed to drive lasting changes, and decided to share the lessons with more than just the 1,000 attendees. In her first , she writes about what happens when you see inspiration from around the world, when you’re forced to think bigger about what you can change. “What's stopping you?” she asks. I can tell you: fear. I still remember the late night in the fall of 2012 when we were just about to launch the ability to write on LinkedIn. We were a small team of editors, engineers, product managers, marketers and designers in Mountain View, California and NYC. I was sharing a cab across the Manhattan Bridge with a colleague and we both started rehearsing worst-case scenarios: The hand-picked 150 people we were launching with — the Influencers — would write once, but never return. They’d copy-and-paste press releases or old speeches, content that satisfied them but didn’t engage the professional world. Readers would ignore it. In a few hours, we’d find out if were really launching what we hoped we were: a platform that would be the first place professionals go to explain and debate their world. Because we promised the Influencers they’d have an immediate impact, we couldn’t launch this to just a small test group of members — or normal process. We had to go big. Three years later — and with publishing now available to all English speaking members and, soon, every language — we know what that best case looks like. First the numbers: Our over publish more than on LinkedIn. About are in the upper ranks of their industries: managers, VPs, CEOs, etc. The top content-demanding industries are tech, financial services and higher education. The average post now reaches professionals in 21 industries and 9 countries. Even more interesting are the stories. We’ve heard from major book publishers like Simon & Schuster who see spikes in sales every time their business authors write on LinkedIn. We’ve heard from people who are new to blog writing who can’t believe what they see. , the former Sex and the City writer who is now show runner on Bravo’s new comedy, Odd Mom Out, wrote a post about . It garnered 68,000 views and an amazing 178 comments from real, identifiable people (many of whom said they were immediately setting their DVRs). “The overwhelmingly positive response has been so heartening — and shocking, given the state of most comments online,” she said. Rottenberg is working on her next post. Many publishers have found that achieving a regular cadence is helping them expand their reach. Stephen Frey is an architect based in Montpelier, VT. His on design trends in the workplace have been picked up by regional papers and have opened up doors — including a meeting with a chancellor of an important local college — that have led to new business and deeper discussions. After every initial meeting with a potential client, Frey sends 2-3 of his LinkedIn posts that flesh out what they had just discussed. And something I love: He says the process of getting his thoughts on the screen has helped him better understand how and what he thinks, which carries over into speeches, coffees and beyond. It’s helping him gain business and be better at business. I’m now a follower (and you should be, too!). Or check out Jeff Morgan, president of Morgan Miller Plumbing in Kansas City. He says his posts ( ) lead to one new client a week. “Once you begin to participate, professionals on LinkedIn do the rest,” he says. “Soon people are checking you out, asking you questions, getting advice.” A lot of writers like Jeff have come to see this is an investment, not a quick solution. “You must participate, you must read others articles, like others posts, let them know you are out there thinking of them. It cannot be just about you and what you'd like to say. Sure that is part of it, but ONLY part of it.” With more than 1 million professionals now posting, I could go on endlessly with examples. Instead, I asked the editors to pick some of their recent favorite member posts. I hope this gives you some new ideas, new people to follow and maybe sparks some posts of your own.

A day to invest, inspire and innovate. That day is called Investment Day, or “InDay” for short, and it is one of our most treasured traditions at LinkedIn. At LinkedIn, Talent is our number one operating priority, and investing in our employees by dedicating one day a month to invest in themselves goes a long way in fostering the culture that was created when we were a much smaller company. In fact, InDay started in 2010 when LinkedIn had less than 1,000 employees. Today, we’re north of 8,000 with offices in 30 cities around the world, and InDay has remained one of the most important elements of our company and culture. Each of the 12 monthly themes - such as giving back, relationships, learning, wellness and play - reveals the essence of who we are as a company. On any given InDay, from Bangalore to Omaha, co-workers and managers connect, create and collaborate to in which they want to work. Every company has a culture unique to them. Managers and leaders play an important role as stewards of their company culture.

But once he got comfortable with all of the people, learned more about my job, saw the campus, and of course, indulged in some of the food, joining me at LinkedIn’s first Bring In Your Parents Day was such a rewarding experience—for both of us.  My dad was finally able to see first-hand what my workplace was all about. He could understand the unique challenges of working for a global company and see where I spend the majority of my days during the week. It was so different from the garages where he worked and seeing it for himself has made it so much easier to talk to my dad about work. In 2014, my dad and I convinced my mom to join us as well for the second annual Bring In Your Parents Day. As part of the day, I led a session for parents on how to use LinkedIn – something I do every day as part of my job as a LinkedIn evangelist – but I usually don’t have my parents in the audience. They saw me present about LinkedIn at Bring In Your Parents Day and now they're able to understand what I do when I go into a company and teach them about our platform. It was so fun to have them not only learn about how they should be using LinkedIn, but also for them to see me in “work mode,” demonstrating the skills that they have taught me my entire life.

We saw good progress in executing on transitions across our business. We achieved record levels of operating and free cash flow and continue to invest in creating value for members and customers. I highly encourage you to review , including our GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation. [1] I will co-host a with our CEO to discuss our financial results for the second quarter 2015 and business outlook today at 2:00PM Pacific Time. See slides below. This post contains non-GAAP financials measures relating to the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures at http://investors.linkedin.com/ and additional details regarding the use of non-GAAP measures below.  This post also contains forward-looking statements about our products, including our investments in products, technology and other key strategic areas, certain non-financial metrics, such as customer and member growth and engagement, and our expected financial metrics such as revenue, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP EPS, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and fully-diluted weighted shares for the third quarter of 2015 and the full fiscal year 2015. The achievement of the matters covered by such forward-looking statements involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, the company’s results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements the company makes. The risks and uncertainties referred to above include - but are not limited to - risks associated with: our limited operating history in a new and unproven market; engagement of our members; the price volatility of our Class A common stock; general economic conditions; expectations regarding the return on our strategic investments; execution of our plans and strategies, including with respect to mobile products and features and expansion into new areas and businesses; security measures and the risk that they may not be sufficient to secure our member data adequately or that we are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of members to access our solutions; expectations regarding our ability to timely and effectively scale and adapt existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that our solutions are accessible at all times with short or no perceptible load times; our ability to maintain our rate of revenue growth and manage our expenses and investment plans; our ability to accurately track our key metrics internally; members and customers curtailing or ceasing to use our solutions; our core value of putting members first, which may conflict with the short-term interests of the business; privacy and changes in regulations, which could impact our ability to serve our members or curtail our monetization efforts; litigation and regulatory issues; increasing competition; our ability to manage our growth; our international operations; our ability to recruit and retain our employees; the application of U.S. and international tax laws on our tax structure and any changes to such tax laws; acquisitions we have made or may make in the future; and the dual class structure of our Class A common stock. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company’s financial results is included in filings it makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and additional information will also be set forth in our Form 10-Q that will be filed for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, which should be read in conjunction with these financial results. These documents are or will be available on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Relations page of the company's website at http://investors.linkedin.com/. All information provided in this post is as of July 30, 2015, and LinkedIn undertakes no duty to update this information. To supplement its condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to peer operating results. Non-cash interest expense related to convertible senior notes. In November 2014, the company issued $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes. In accordance with GAAP, the company separately accounted for the value of the conversion feature as a debt discount, which is amortized in a manner that reflects the company’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, the company recognizes imputed interest expense on its convertible senior notes of approximately 4.7% in its statement of operations. The company excludes the difference between the imputed interest expense and coupon interest expense, net of any capitalized interest, because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Income tax effects and adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by considering the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, the company has implemented a static non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected 10-year weighted average non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect the company's long-term operations. Historically, the company computed a non-GAAP tax rate based on non-GAAP pre-tax income on a quarterly basis. Based on the company's current forecast, a tax rate of 23% has been applied to its non-GAAP financial results for the current period. This rate will be adjusted annually, if necessary. The company believes that adjusting for these income tax effects and adjustments provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from its non-GAAP net income. Dilutive shares under the treasury stock method. During periods with a net loss, the company excluded certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Trended Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in the company’s earnings release, which is available at the investor relations portion of its website at . This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP EPS guidance to net loss or GAAP EPS guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or GAAP provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net loss and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. As items that impact net loss are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net loss is not available without unreasonable effort."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News","Featured","Editorial"],"author":"Angela Yang","title":"LinkedIn Publishing Goes Global with Localized Languages","date":"August 4, 2015","content":"As professionals, we all have our own perspective on the world around us, but until recently, we didn’t always have the right platform to share it on.

My cofounder, , and I designed, built and launched the first version of the app on the App Store in 6 short weeks. In the next three years as an independent company, we had an incredible ride, growing the Pulse user base to 30 million users and the team to 25 people. In 2013, as we started thinking about the future of Pulse, we realized that to truly become the authoritative source of daily news, we’d have to get significantly better with our content recommendations. We had done an amazing job giving our users the ability to visually see news from hundreds of sources in one place. But users were increasingly getting lost in this stream of information. Pulse needed to sift through the millions of articles published every day and pick the ones that are essential for each user. In this whole puzzle, we missed one key component: Identity. We knew 30 million users had used the Pulse app, but we didn’t know who they were or who they knew. That is precisely why we joined LinkedIn, the largest professional network. In the past two years, we’ve been hard at work to marry the best content that Pulse has with the deep identity and network data that LinkedIn has, to create the world’s first personalized business news digest. Pulse today powers a lot of content you see on LinkedIn’s homepage feed. Pulse content is also delivered to millions of users every week via the email digest. And perhaps most interestingly, Pulse now has its own organic content. Thanks to the publishing platform, are now published every week in the LinkedIn Pulse ecosystem. Through this work, Pulse has emerged as one of the fastest growing products on LinkedIn. Today, I’m very excited to announce the launch of fully redesigned Pulse mobile apps for iOS and Android. Instead of slapping features on to the old reader app, we decided to completely redesign the new Pulse experience from the ground up. The new Pulse app focuses on delivering you personalized news—news that is powered by your professional world. When you start the new app, you’ll experience an effortless onboarding process. You don’t need to follow publishers or topics or anything to get started—just log in with your LinkedIn account, and Pulse instantly gives you today’s news based on the industry you work in, who you’re connected to and what you follow on LinkedIn, The new cards-based interface has been designed to enable users to skim through lots of content quickly. Don’t like a story? Dismiss it. Want to read a story later? Save it. Like the author of the article? Follow them. All these interactions will continuously refine your content recommendations. The recommendations come from a variety of sources—so let me take you through a couple examples: The first story I see when I log in is a post written by the LinkedIn editor . Her daily post brings me up to speed with all the business news I need to know to get started. Next, the Pulse app knows I work in the Internet industry, so it surfaces a story that is trending in my field. Pulse also know that I currently work as a product manager at LinkedIn —so it recommends a story that’s popular among my fellow coworkers. Next, it alerts me that my connection (and friend) was mentioned in the news. By clicking on that story, I discovered that he’s hosting President Obama and other business leaders at his home this week. (Woah!) Thanks to the Newsle product that LinkedIn acquired last year, I can set up notifications in Pulse so that I get notified every time a connection makes the news. As you can see, without any input on my side, Pulse was able to recommend very relevant, targeted news stories to me, based on my professional identity and my connections. And that’s what we hope to do for 360+ million professionals around the world. The new app, now available on and , will replace the old app in both stores. The old apps will continue working for existing users till the end of year. Get ahead of the day with the reimagined Pulse app that is all new and all news.

In fact, one of the winning teams of the is currently working on research that evaluates gender differences in self-promotion on profiles. Having released our own and an update on our and efforts last week, and with diversity and inclusion continuing to be an important issue across fields, we decided to take a look at gender parity across several industries. We analyzed millions of profiles and compared female representation across a dozen industry groups - with a detailed look at leadership positions and software engineers. Industry leaders can use this data as a benchmark to measure their progress towards achieving gender equality in the workplace. An important factor to measure is the leadership gap, which we’re defining as the difference in female representation between membership overall, and members in leadership positions. Looking at healthcare, 59.8% of all members in the industry are women. However, only 45.2% of members in leadership positions are women - a gap of 14.6%. Retail and financial services have a similar gap, with financial services having the lowest absolute representation of women in leadership (28.7%) among the three industry groups we highlighted. In these industries, leadership is less representative of their companies as a whole with regards to gender. For reference, government, education, and nonprofit industries have the narrowest gap (6.4%). Technology companies are generally considered to be some of the most sought-after employers in the world. We have an inherent “home field advantage” when it comes to recruiting the largest and richest talent pools of our most critical position: software engineers. However, despite this advantage, our data indicates that . For example, a typical software engineering team in a healthcare company is likely to be 32% women, compared to 20% in technology. While these non-tech industries employ significantly fewer software engineers versus technology, their teams tend to exhibit greater gender parity. We noticed significant variance within the technology, financial services and insurance industries. Below, we broke out the technology group into its twelve component industries represented on LinkedIn. Companies that operate in e-learning and information services industries have the most gender equal workforces within our technology group. However, even among these relatively inclusive tech industries, women are significantly underrepresented within software engineering roles. Below, we broke out the financial services and insurance group into its nine component industries represented on LinkedIn. As we noted above, there is a significant leadership gap in these industries. Accounting, insurance, commercial real estate, and venture capital all have gaps of 16% or more. In accounting firms, women represent nearly half of the total employee base, but only 26% of leadership. The three industries that employ the most software engineers - financial services, insurance, and banking - all tend to include proportionally more women than each of the technology industries we looked at. As we continue to build the , a digital representation of the global economy, we want to create more transparency for issues like gender diversity by drawing insights from our data, allowing business leaders and members alike to make better informed decisions that ultimately create economic opportunity."},{"post_categories":["Economic Graph","Featured"],"author":"Allen Blue","title":"Creating Economic Opportunity in Cities Around the World","date":"June 24, 2015","content":"Have you ever seen a job that you wanted, but you didn’t have the skills or training to get it?

And we're planning to take the lessons learned and apply them more broadly in other cities and regions. Public and private partnerships like Rework America Connected are integral to creating opportunity for everyone. We’re excited to support the Rework America Connected effort in Colorado and Phoenix and to build on the work that we’ve been doing in other cities and regions over the past year. Here are some examples of the cities-centered work that we’ve been doing: In February, we worked on New York City’s program, a $10 million initiative meant to train New Yorkers for high-tech jobs. Together, we analyzed aggregate LinkedIn data from more than three million LinkedIn members in the New York City region and 150,000 NYC-based businesses to provide Tech Talent Pipeline with insights on the current state of the city’s tech industry. Using the data, the city will be able to decide how to strategically deploy their resources to create the greatest economic impact. We are also starting similar research in Toronto, which engages the private, not-for-profit and public sectors to uncover data to address skills gaps in the Toronto area. This work is in collaboration with . In Chicago, we leveraged Economic Graph data to analyze the city’s software engineering ecosystem, evaluating their ability to retain local talent, migration of talent into and out of Chicago, and companies that are improving the local tech scene. This directly informed outreach strategies for the city’s event, a workshop for aspiring graduates from top universities across the country. Knowing how to better position themselves, ThinkChicago received 1,032 applications for the event in 2014, up from 618 in 2013. In Europe, the Amsterdam Economic Board - an organization that encourages innovation and collaboration between business, universities, and government - worked with LinkedIn to map what the current IT talent landscape in Amsterdam looks like and what the Board can do to attract more international talent in the future. The City of Manchester, England, is . These insights will be used by the to help professionals develop the skills required to get jobs and strengthen and grow the region's economy. Urban areas will continue to grow in the coming decades to house an even larger majority of the world’s population. To that end, we will continue to find opportunities to deploy the in cities where our data can best help create economic opportunity. In developing the world’s first Economic Graph, we are realizing LinkedIn’s vision to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce.

Often referred to as the “happiest man in the world,” Matthieu is an international best-selling author and a prominent speaker on the world stage. We were honored to have him sit down with our CEO, Jeff Weiner, in the latest installment of the LinkedIn Speaker Series. In the interview, Matthieu spoke about our quest for happiness and the ways in which happiness is defined and pursued. Every person is seeking happiness, or more specifically, the avoidance of suffering. And truth be told, there’s a lot of suffering in the world. You may think that suffering only happens with those who you may not regularly interact with, but it actually includes all of us. You, me, the people we work with, all the people we interact with on a daily basis find ourselves suffering at some points in our lives. Suffering may be a result of an injury, illness or loss; it can also stem from some interactions with the people we work with. While the source may or may not come from work, it can end up in your workplace. In most corporate settings, compassion, mindfulness, and the obtainment of happiness have become catch-phrases and tools to make more money, increase productivity, or pursue any number of short-sighted goals. And while it may be true that short-term, self-driven goals may be obtained while misusing the practice of mindfulness and compassion, Matthieu teaches us that only through altruism can we obtain true happiness for ourselves and for others. So what are we to do? Matthieu presents a way to ease our own suffering and the suffering of others. How? Nurture and exhibit our inherent ability to be altruistic in our motivations, our actions, and our inactions. What is altruism? Put simply, it's the wish that other people may be happy; we can nurture it by practicing caring-mindfulness and exhibit it through compassion. Caring-mindfulness can be practiced in every moment of our lives, but it is called a ‘practice’ for a reason; it takes time and repetition in order to make it a part of your life. Devoting time each day to a meditation practice allows our altruistic nature to come forth. This can be as easy as 10 minutes every morning. Simply sit in silence and consciously breath, counting your inhalations and exhalations up from 1-10, and back again from 10-1. Repeat this pattern for 10 minutes. During this time your mind will inevitably wander, when you recognize that it has wandered, gently bring your focus back to your breath and start the count over. Another way to practice caring-mindfulness is to take 10 seconds every hour to stop what you are doing and consciously breath. This helps keep your daily practice fresh throughout the day. What you'll find through this practice is that exhibiting compassion becomes not a conscious decision, but a natural way to operate. You will gradually become more attentive to others in conversation, you will naturally find yourself caring for others, and you will see those people flourish along with you. Watch the full LinkedIn Speaker Series video below and learn more about why Matthieu believes that altruism could be the saving grace of the 21st century."},{"post_categories":["Featured","Editorial"],"author":"Amy Chen","title":"What the World's Best Leaders Know About Thriving in Turbulent Times","date":"July 7, 2015","content":"Whether you’re a manager or the one being managed, everyone seems to have an opinion on what types of leadership work — and what doesn’t. In our latest series on LinkedIn, we went to the top and asked some of the world’s most successful CEOs and industry experts to share their leadership secrets and surefire management methods. From Richard Branson to GM CEO Mary Barra, more than 50 Influencers revealed how they lead in times of turmoil or growth. But among the stories of success, some Influencers also recounted how they acquired their now-vaunted leadership skills the hard way: As inexperienced managers or bosses fumbling their way through trial and error, some of their leadership mistakes cost jobs, lowered employee morale, and/or resulted in personal feelings of failure. Or in the case of Craigslist founder Craig Newmark, he gave up management entirely after having an epiphany that he simply “sucked as a manager.” What inspires you to be a better leader?

Turns out the Virgin Group founder believes in taking a contemplative approach to decision-making: “After looking at all the stats, speaking to all the experts and analysing all of the angles, then take some time to yourself to think things through clearly. Take a walk, find a shady spot, or simply sit and think for a while.” Taking your time may result in some missed opportunities, Branson admits. “One example that springs to mind is taking too long to decide to buy the rights to a new game called Trivial Pursuit,” .

It was a different time, when command and control was an accepted and expected leadership style. But still, looking back, I’m not proud of this behavior. It wasn’t cool. And, I soon learned it wasn’t the most effective way to lead.” Decades later, Webb now swears by leading with intensity — not intimidation.

Professor Yunus delivered an inspiring talk on his experiences empowering impoverished entrepreneurs through microcredit and microfinance -- a topic that closely aligns with LinkedIn’s vision of creating economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. Professor Yunus never intended to become an entrepreneur, let alone start a bank. But it all started with him providing tiny loans to people who normally wouldn’t get one. While teaching economics in Bangladesh in 1974, he saw the struggle first-hand when people simply couldn’t escape poverty or get loans to start businesses, except from loan sharks. He wanted to help and decided to lend to people that desperately needed money. He soon realized that this solution wouldn't scale and decided to help people get loans from banks by serving as the loan guarantee. As the loan amounts increased, banks became hesitant, so he took the matter into his own hands and started a bank himself. The Grameen Bank was thus born. I found it interesting to hear that the Grameen Bank goes against the conventional bank model, providing micro-loans to the impoverished without requiring collateral. Today, the bank has 8.5M borrowers across 80,000 villages in Bangladesh, 97% of whom are women. It lends $1.5 billion every year in loans with no collateral, with an impressive 98%+ loan repayment rate. Yunus highlighted other key differences from conventional banks: The Grameen Bank lends to groups of people consisting of (mostly) women based on trust, operates primarily in villages, and believes that “banks should go to people” instead of “people going to banks”. The bank is owned by the borrowers so that any profits are returned to them. According to Yunus, it is not enough to identify and evaluate the financial needs of the poorest people in a neighborhood, but the most important and challenging task is developing confidence in them so that they can borrow and start successful businesses. By reaching out to the people in the villages, the bank develops personal relationships, and provides guidance on forming groups and starting businesses. Quite often, the financial needs coexist with other pressing needs such as nutrition, health care, and skill development. Consequently, the bank has diversified by forming social businesses to address such challenges. It successfully operates several eye care hospitals to treat cataracts, which are widely prevalent amongst the impoverished in Bangladesh. It also forms joint ventures with large corporations to address social problems, including high-risk pregnancies and malnutrition in children. The impact Yunus and the Grameen Bank have had on people’s lives is truly incredible. Another area that Yunus is passionate about is creating a world without unemployment. He believes that we can create that world by encouraging the youth to think and act like job creators. He worries that today’s youth is only focused on seeking salaried jobs, rather than being able to think from an entrepreneurial perspective. This is especially a problem since the number of salaried jobs available has not kept pace with the demand in regions such as Bangladesh. “A job is an old-fashioned idea from the twentieth century,” states Yunus. He believes that the popular idea of jobs did not exist until after the industrial revolution (with the arrival of current education system). To encourage the second generation of Grameen Bank loan-seekers to be entrepreneurial, he tells them, “How did your mother manage to create a business with just $20 or $30 although she was illiterate, and no one was willing to trust her? Why do you hesitate to start a business when you have an in-house business consultant with 20+ years of experience?” In addition to encouraging an entrepreneurial spirit, Yunus’ vision includes sustainable businesses -- not just economically sustainable (aiming for zero poverty in the world), but also socially sustainable (aiming for zero unemployment) and ecologically sustainable (aiming for zero net emission). After listening to Yunus’ talk, I have been asking myself: how can we help empower and create educational and economic opportunities for the everyone in the world? What can technology platforms, like LinkedIn, do to help address labor market inefficiencies and create a world without unemployment? Broadly, what can technology and social/professional networks do to democratize access to information about economic opportunities, and educate and train the workforce for jobs of the future? I would love to hear your thoughts."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News"],"author":"Sandy Hoffman","title":"LinkedIn’s 2015 Workforce Diversity","date":"June 8, 2015","content":"In 2011, I attended the APEC Women and Economic Summit, and it changed my entire career outlook and trajectory. That forum focused on the barriers to economic participation faced by women and others - and how much better it is for nations when everyone has a chance to be part of the economy. The message inspired me to take on a larger role and position of leadership for all of our inclusion and diversity efforts. Perhaps more than any other company, I realized that LinkedIn has the potential to connect professionals to economic opportunity. To transform the world, we first have to transform LinkedIn. That’s the mission to which I am deeply committed as director of our new Global Inclusion team. Last June, we first reported our diversity metrics, and today we wanted to give an update on our progress. The full set of data can be found . For additional information, please refer to our Our latest numbers show encouraging results, and we are pleased with our progress. Each gain is the work of many. Our numbers also show where we still have room for much more progress, so we need to be relentless in our efforts. Our initial focus on gender diversity has netted gains with growth in women’s representation in technical roles (1%), leadership (5%), and overall (3%). Progress has been driven by a variety of efforts. The within our Global Sales team and the initiative within our Engineering and Product organizations have built a framework to hire, retain, develop and advance women. They have: By identifying and rapidly spreading inclusion practices that work, we can scale progress to all dimensions of diversity at LinkedIn. Our six Employee Resource Groups serving female, Black, Latino, LGBT, veteran, and disabled employees are a vital element of our inclusion strategy. They are working together to create community, attract talent, and expand professional skills and networks. Through their work, LinkedIn’ers have helped people with hearing impairments and autism as well as veterans and underrepresented minorities. Additionally, we continue to invest in strategic partnerships that align to our vision and mission. These partnerships, with organizations such as and help LinkedIn build its diversity and inclusion and invest externally in building the STEM pipeline more broadly. We want to ensure that we consider all the best talent available when we bring people in - and that we help them thrive once they’re here. We are taking a more holistic approach to our recruiting efforts, from enhancing our outreach efforts towards new talent pools to ensuring an inclusive talent acquisition process. Efforts include deepening strategic relationships that connect us to talent, leveraging our own platform, and integrating best practices for diversity recruiting. We already see results - for example, 43% of all hires have been women over the last 12 months. This journey to embed inclusion in all that we do has gotten off to a great start thanks to the enthusiasm and commitment of hundreds of our leaders and employees.

Experts Debate the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead","date":"June 9, 2015","content":"If you’ve ever wondered whether what you’re doing all day matters, sometimes it helps to pause and gain a little perspective. For our latest series on LinkedIn, we asked some of the world’s top experts to stop and take a candid look at their industries: What are the evolutions you're seeing? What are the key problems that need to be solved in the short- and long-term? Join 70+ Influencers as they debate the state — and future of — their industries. From Richard Branson to Lockheed Martin's Marillyn Hewson, what did these experts get right (and wrong)? What did they gloss over or miss entirely? If you could do it over again, would you pick the same industry? What opportunities might your industry offer students and career-changers? What skills should they develop to help move your industry forward? ; please use the hashtag somewhere in the body (not the headline) of your post. *** Here’s what some Influencers believe will help their industries stay relevant and forward-thinking: According to , stuffy work environments stifle creativity. “You’ll only ever catch me in a suit at a wedding or at dinner with the Queen,” . “Suits aren’t totally to blame for lacklustre working environments, but there’s freedom that comes from breaking down barriers, and giving people a sense of self-expression and enjoyment while working. We spend majority of our lives at work, so why not enjoy it?” Fortunately, in an age of T-shirts à la Mark Zuckerberg, more hoodie-clad entrepreneurs are proving it’s possible to cultivate successful businesses that are also “places of innovation, creativity and, most of all, happiness within the work force.\" Long after TripAdvisor allowed travelers to rate and research hotels, some leaders in the hospitality industry were still paralyzed by old habits. “This kind of loss of control would have sent – and for those who considered it, did send — shockwaves through a company: ‘What if there’s a negative review?!?’” . So what actually happened after his company finally started displaying unfiltered guest reviews on its corporate hotel websites? “Shocking to some was what didn’t happen. The sky didn’t fall… [And] one well-articulated complaint can provide us a roadmap on exactly where and how to improve.” Few industries are ridiculed as much as the cable industry, which is desperately trying to shed its ineffectual \"Cable Guy\" image. Given that consumers now expect on-demand libraries and Wi-Fi hotspots, leaders in the cable industry are finally ready to cut the cord: “The industry knows consumers want content on every screen in their life and it is delivering new products, like TV Everywhere, that make it possible to do so … and liberate consumers from a fixed television set,”  Think your industry is way ahead of the curve? With an eye trained on the next big thing, many 25-year projects in the global aerospace and defense industry are already underway, says . Unfortunately while the long-term vision is in place, the talent is not: “Many experienced professionals are reaching retirement age, and we face a critical shortage of new STEM talent to meet increasing demand. That’s why Lockheed Martin [has] more than 2,000 vacancies in these critical fields right now.” In recent years, the traditional auto industry has taken a back seat in the public eye to tech competitors like Tesla and Google. (Self-driving cars, anyone?) But as Ford unveils some of its plans for connectivity, mobility, and autonomous vehicles, perhaps it’s this promise that will help the company regain its edge: “True to who we are at Ford, we’ll make these innovations affordable and accessible to millions of people around the world, not just a select few who can afford luxury vehicles,” Given the recent Brian Williams scandal at NBC and other high-profile gaffes by journalists who suddenly became part of the news cycle, knows the media industry (particularly broadcast journalism) is on shaky ground: “We can’t turn back the clock to a time when everyone watched the evening news at 6:30 p.m. And we can’t pretend the Internet and mobile devices haven’t upended the economic model upon which mainstream TV media depended for decades.” And yet, Velshi says the role of the news journalist has never been more critical: *** In the coming weeks, we’ll also hear from leading industry voices in advertising, education, energy, healthcare, law, oil & gas, and more. Here's a sampling: ; please include somewhere in the body (not the headline) of your piece."},{"post_categories":["Economic Graph","LinkedIn Life"],"author":"Erica Lockheimer","title":"Empowering Women in Tech at LinkedIn to Transform Their Careers","date":"June 10, 2015","content":"Two of the core values guiding everything we do at LinkedIn are integrity and collaboration.To live our values fully, we believe it’s critical to have our employees represent as diverse a range of backgrounds and viewpoints as our members do. This balance of perspectives helps us achieve our goal of making the world’s professionals more productive and successful, and ultimately creating economic opportunity. However in the technology industry today, and even at LinkedIn, we continue to fall short in achieving gender balance among software engineers and other technical roles. To gain deeper insight into gender imbalance in the workplace we recently analyzed millions of LinkedIn member profiles and compared female representation across a dozen industry groups. This data shows a significant gap persists across industries and in technology less than a third of tech industry workers are women, and only one in five of its leaders are women. Late last year, I took up the challenge of spearheading our Women in Tech (WIT) efforts with a goal of tackling this imbalance head-on. Our mission is to empower women in tech roles at LinkedIn to transform themselves, their careers and the company. We’re also committed to attracting and retaining the best women to join our team at LinkedIn, and becoming role models for the next generation of technical talent. In an attempt to ensure our initiative achieves long-lasting and meaningful impact, we have selected a leadership team of accomplished, respected and talented female tech execs at LinkedIn who have hands-on ownership and responsibility for its success. To aid continuity and long-lasting commitment, our leads are being measured on WIT impact as part of their day jobs - not as volunteers. Each of us has been working in the tech trenches our whole careers - living and breathing the effects of the gender imbalance in our workplaces. In addition, our executive sponsor for WIT is Kevin Scott, the SVP of engineering and operations at LinkedIn. WIT at LinkedIn is focused on four specific areas: empowering career transformation for women at LinkedIn; attracting the best female talent to LinkedIn; ensuring our culture is always inclusive and engaging; and inspiring the next generation of tech women. The momentum we’re seeing from WIT initiatives so far is encouraging. Our showed gains on women’s representation in technical roles (1%) and leadership (5%). We’ve helped connect dozens of female industry leaders in the U.S. and India through mixers and WomenConnect networking dinners. We’re starting long-term efforts to get more girls into STEM, and we’re already seeing attitudes and awareness improvements among our colleagues. Little things like gender-neutral language in meetings and in tech documentation add up when applied with discipline and rigor across companies and industries. As Director of Growth and one of the most senior female engineers at LinkedIn, taking on this additional role was not easy. As a working mother of two who is also heading up a global team of 70+ people working to drive our member growth, I wasn’t sure how to fit in this new responsibility. Plus, as a woman who has worked her way up through the ranks of tech companies over the past 20 years, my strategy was always to succeed by the merits of my hard work and strong relationships with my male and female colleagues. While speaking up on potentially sensitive subjects was not my natural way, I also didn’t want to pass up this chance to make meaningful change to benefit the next generation of female tech stars. The problem of gender disparity in technology was not created overnight, and the gap won’t be closed in a year or two. But we’re confident that long-term change initiatives like WIT will make our industry a more hospitable and inclusive career option for people of every background."},{"post_categories":["Featured","Editorial","Infographic"],"author":"Byron Ma","title":"Why LinkedIn is the Best Place to Publish","date":"June 11, 2015","content":"You have something to say, but finding the right platform for your content is as important as what you have to say. If you’re a professional with a valuable perspective to share, you have to find the audience it will resonate with - the audience you can invite along for the ride. It’s that perspective that makes you unique – and that ability to spark conversation among your peers that can take you far. Just as you bring it to the table each day to work for your company, your platform can and should be working for you.  We know there are plenty of places to share your thoughts on everything from top food destinations around the world to top tips for getting the best manicure– but for content for that is relevant to professionals, LinkedIn is the only platform where the audience you want to reach is waiting for you, and wants professional content. Other sites have content in search of an audience but LinkedIn has an audience in search of content (in fact, more than 360 million professionals worldwide), and with it, you have the ability to speak directly to the people you want to reach.  What does that mean for you? It means that on LinkedIn can have a direct impact on you as a professional, like those experienced by , who landed her dream job in a new country thanks to a series of events that started with , or , who met his professional idol and mentor following a wildly crazy post he did on LinkedIn about how he took .  You have the opportunity to reach other professionals from around the world – senior leaders, potential clients, employers, partners, mentors and more – the people that can impact your bottom line or have an impact on your career. The audience is here, and they are looking for the content, the thought leaders, the tips to help them grow in their careers — you as the writer, can be that expert. In fact, on average, posts on LinkedIn see 6x the views from people outside of your immediate network. That can translate to huge opportunity. Here’s how:   But it doesn’t stop there--you can also see what impact you’re having. Once you’ve published on LinkedIn, check out to see who read, shared, or commented on your post, plus important insights on the industries and regions your readers come from, their level of seniority, and how they found you. Leverage those insights to help tailor your message, share it with your network, and let the power of LinkedIn and your network get your content in front of the people that actually matter to you most. Share your perspective, build your professional brand, and let your voice be heard – most importantly, make sure it’s being heard by the professionals that matter to you."},{"post_categories":["Economic Graph"],"author":"Ariel Eckstein","title":"86,000 Reasons Why Residents of Greater Manchester Need to be on LinkedIn","date":"June 16, 2015","content":"I am passionate about helping professionals of all ages develop the skills they need to get hired and be successful.

Greater Manchester has a diverse economy with more than 1.39 million professionals and more than 97,000 businesses. But the Councils recognise that the skills required to get jobs today differ from the skills required 10 years ago. And they’ll surely differ from the skills required 10 years from now, so Greater Manchester must constantly advance its workforce skills to strengthen and grow its economy. That’s where LinkedIn comes in. The initial part of the project begins today and will see LinkedIn land in the streets of Manchester and encourage professionals in the region to update their LinkedIn profile with their latest professional information including their skills, education, and work experience or create a profile if they don’t already have one. Last month alone recruiters on LinkedIn performed more than 86,000 searches for candidates in Greater Manchester. A profile picture, or skills listed, can dramatically increase chances of people, including potential employers, seeing your profile. So with so many opportunities in the city already, and many more to come in the next 10 years, we’re asking Greater Manchester residents a simple question over the next two weeks – why keep a low profile?

Doctors told us she would never walk or talk. Thankfully, they were wrong. Although delayed and requiring one-on-one assistance for safety, Eliza is now 8 years old and does walk – she even runs and has plenty to say to her mother and anyone else who’ll listen! My marriage, however, didn’t survive, and in June of 2013, I found myself divorced,  with sole custody of my children, contemplating my next move. One night, I woke up with the words “Special Globe” ringing in my head. The next morning, I did a Google search for “Special Globe.” Nothing came up, but I found I could purchase the domain name for $11.49. I bought it on the spot. Little did I know that the direction of my life would change forever and a huge part of that would be thanks to LinkedIn. Really, LinkedIn helped me change more than life. As a child, travel had a profound effect on me. I wanted that same experience for my children, but the road seemed a scary place for Eliza. Would the world accept her? Would there be resources to fit her needs? I couldn’t find much information online to help us, and I knew that other special needs families experienced the same thing. And that’s how SpecialGlobe was born. I set out to create the trusted travel resource I couldn’t find – a TripAdvisor for special needs families. It would empower families like mine to step out of their fear and travel with the whole family, creating a lifetime of memories. I knew first hand how much travel could help special needs children and their families. Eliza develops new skills on every trip we take. Her teachers have all remarked on how, after trips, her vocabulary expands and her patience increases. I was excited to bring that experience to other special needs families, too. So we got to work. As my business partner built the site, I set out to build the brand. I started researching and identifying influential figures in the travel industry, special needs organizations, and the media. It’s amazing that so many influential people are on LinkedIn. I contacted people directly, sending connection requests and InMail – the fact that they actually responded blew me out of the water. My first success was connecting with , a member of the founding team at Priceline, who agreed to be an advisor. When I hung up the phone with him, I did a happy dance. It hit me that if Jeff Hoffman supported our idea, then we must be onto something! Over the next 18 months, I kept building partners for SpecialGlobe through LinkedIn.

Hello My Name Is...sweaty and uncomfortable. Hello My Name Is...can I go home now? For many of us, traditional networking is the stuff of nightmares - from the “Hello My Name Is” sticker stuck haphazardly on your suit jacket to the pressure to be as charming as Jimmy Fallon with every new person you meet. Personally, I don’t love these kinds of cold-start networking events - but as part of my professional life, I do love staying in touch with my network, asking them for advice, and helping people out with questions or leads. The bottom line: networking is really just building and nurturing your professional relationships - and we all do that organically every day as we make friendships and create lasting connections in our personal lives. On the professional front, the only thing that changes are the tools you might use to connect and stay in touch. Three LinkedIn members and entrepreneurs shared how they used LinkedIn profiles, messages and long-form posts to help forge and strengthen great professional relationships: When attorney and entrepreneur left a high-caliber legal practice to move back to Utah, she used her LinkedIn profile to build credibility as she developed the kind of litigation practice and client base she had left behind. “I’ve always tried to avoid being ‘sales-y’ at networking events,” she said. “Being in the moment and making a personal connection is more important to me because that’s how you build a relationship.” Instead, Megan lets her profile do the talking for her by inviting people to connect as a follow-up after great conversations. On LinkedIn, they see her experience, history and professional identity and it reinforces the first impressions she’s made. “My profile really helps me show, not tell, someone that I’m a capable professional.” Ease up on yourself in professional social settings and just enjoy getting to know people, no agenda involved. Then send a personalized connection request afterward to keep the conversation going. As founder and CEO knows, asking for help when you’re starting out can feel daunting. But she needed some insights and perspective as she started her first company and InMail and messages were her way, well, in. She sent quick, simple notes to people she thought were interesting and sharp - and they responded. “I loved connecting with entrepreneurs to talk about what we’re creating,” said Adeosun. “Those initial connections have since become advisors willing to take our calls when I struggle and investors who have opened their connections to us.” Think of LinkedIn as a place to strategically build your own professional community, Adeosun says, and find many of your champions in one spot. Long messages can feel overwhelming - so write something concise and thoughtful. That makes it easy for someone busy to read, absorb, and then respond to you. As a bonus, your odds of expanding your professional community increase. spent her entire career in tech - and then took an opportunity to completely pivot, creating a rewarding professional second act for herself. Now a fine art photographer, she used LinkedIn to tell that new story - and the ability to write long-form posts on the site to connect with others. “My posts have sparked real engagement with other LinkedIn members,” she said. “I’ve heard from other photographers curious about my work, technique and equipment. One post on getting your photos published even drove visitors to my website.” If your profile tells your professional story, posting - as Andrea observed - reinforces it in your own words and invites others to comment and connect with you. You can begin a great conversation in different ways. Write a post or update yourself - or start small by leaving an insightful comment or a good question on what someone else has shared. Strengthening your relationships with people doesn’t have to be time-consuming or difficult - simple, easy and fast gestures go a long way on LinkedIn. Try commenting on a colleague’s update, “liking” a job change or anniversary, or dropping your old mentor a quick note today. You can ask a question or offer to help - often the best networking comes when you have nothing to gain and everything to offer."},{"post_categories":["Economic Graph","Featured"],"author":"Andrew Kritzer","title":"Get the Most Out of Your MBA Internship with These LinkedIn Insights","date":"May 19, 2015","content":"It’s May and thousands of MBA students are eagerly waiting for their summer internships to kick off. The time between first and second year is the only internship opportunity for most full time MBA students. It’s a critical chance to test out a new company and demonstrate newly developed competencies. It’s a two-way interview for companies to impress students and students to impress prospective employers. For those who complete their summer internships with a full-time offer in hand, the second year is an opportunity to explore and drive passions. For others, the recruiting game starts anew -  interviews and networking continue, and the stakes are even higher as full-time job seekers. As MBA students prepare for their summer internship, we examined the internship outcomes from thousands of MBA students who interned in 2013, graduated in 2014, and attended one of the . Here’s our advice to all you MBA students, based on what we learned: Many companies hire only a portion of their MBA internship class. Relationships matter. Interns who connected with 20+ colleagues in the same year as their internships were more than twice as likely to return full-time in 2014. These connections are often the byproduct of informal lunches or coffee meetings to learn about a coworker’s backgrounds and hobbies. Networking makes you memorable to senior leaders as well as a go-to resource for your peers. Seek out a network of peers and informal mentors over the summer. Follow up with a to keep in touch. While it’s tempting to accept any internship offer, reflect on your career goals and make sure the opportunity is right for you. Interns who did not build strong networks, evidenced by having fewer than 10 company connections, were twice as likely to leave in the full-time roles as interns who built more relationships (10+ connections). If you receive a full-time offer, ask yourself: Did I enjoy working with the people that I met this summer? If you are not certain, carefully evaluate your options before making a decision. This data shows the importance of setting objectives for your internship experience, creating a strong support network to understand your fit within the organization, and ultimately putting yourself in a better position at the end of the summer.

Their new book, , was just released and we were lucky enough to get a sneak peek at some of their key insights. And even though Jack had laryngitis, he was still as passionate and articulate as ever on the subject. Your team should be the place where people want to hang out, according to Jack and Suzy Welch. When discussing key metrics on how well a company is doing, focus on three things: 1) employee engagement, 2) customer satisfaction and 3) cash flow. They emphasized employee engagement and how important it is to really make it fun for people to come to work. This is something Jack focused on when he was at GE and employee engagement went from 30% when he started, to 94% when he left. Another concept that really resonated with me was around finding your area of destiny.  Jack and Suzy describe this as the intersection between something you are uniquely good at and something you love. They encourage everyone to find their area of destiny because that’s where you will be the happiest. The “editor” in Suzy was quick to point out it is not actually a “gene” - but more of a propensity to have a generous spirit and really want the best for the people on your team. Wanting people to grow, to earn more money, to succeed - that’s what comes with the generosity gene. They stressed how important this is and how we can all think of those bosses who had it - and especially those who didn’t. While I listened to this conversation, I experienced such a feeling of gratitude for my job, my manager, and my company. While I don’t want to jinx it, I feel like I have found an area of destiny job, in the cool kid’s basement with a manager (and team!) that has the generosity gene. I will forever be grateful to Jack and Suzy for illuminating this for me and for giving me a great framework to evaluate my career going forward. These were just a few of the concepts Jack and Suzy shared. There are many more educational and inspiring nuggets in this talk.  I encourage you to watch the session in the video below and learn from the real masters on the subjects of leadership, teamwork, and career."},{"post_categories":["Economic Graph","Featured"],"author":"Allen Blue","title":"The $2.7 Trillion Opportunity of Connecting Talent with Opportunity in the Digital Age","date":"June 4, 2015","content":"By 2025, could boost global GDP by $2.7 trillion annually, according to a released this week by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI).

We want to empower people to take advantage of the information and connections within the Economic Graph to find a job, earn a living, acquire new skills, make great decisions, and ultimately enhance their economic opportunities. We know the Economic Graph has the potential to be enormously valuable to local economies and companies. In the past year alone, we utilized the Economic Graph data in collaboration with the initiative and program to help them strategically allocate resources to bolster the workforce.

Perhaps you couldn't help but worry: \"How am I supposed to get experience if no one will hire me?\" Or maybe you debated: \"Is grad school (or a gap year) right for me?\" Or maybe you secretly panicked, wondering: \"Is this what a quarter-life crisis feels like?\" In our latest series on LinkedIn, “If I Were 22,” we asked some of the world’s top voices in business to share what they’d do differently — and keep the same. More than 50 Influencers dusted off old yearbooks and dug into their archives for vintage photos (and some embarrassing stories) from their 20s. In honor of graduation season, LinkedIn also rounded up inspiring quotes from Influencers and other notable personalities. From Richard Branson and Arianna Huffington to Alanis Morissette and David Letterman, check out the 2015 LinkedIn Yearbook to see what some of the world’s most successful professionals wish they knew when they were 22.

We fear that if we don’t cram as much as possible into our day, we might miss out on something fabulous, important, special, or career advancing.” For those who are just starting out in their careers, Huffington hopes success will no longer be defined “by who works the longest hours, who goes the longest without a vacation, who sleeps the least, who responds to an email at midnight or five in the morning.” Who’s with her? spent seven years working as a waitress before finding her path at age 30.

With more than 360 million profiles, LinkedIn is the place you want to be to share your expertise and to discuss issues that matter to you with other like-minded professionals. But, how do you know what is resonating and who is listening to what you have to say? How are you reaching them? Today we’re excited to introduce analytics for publishing on LinkedIn as a new way to answer these questions. Analytics for publishing on LinkedIn provides insights into who’s reading and engaging with your posts. With this knowledge, you’ll be able to evaluate whether you’re reaching the right audience, which posts are resonating with readers, and more. In fact, rather than hearing from us on why we believe analytics for publishing on LinkedIn can offer unique and helpful insights as you plan your next post, we thought we’d let one of our members, David Petherick, tell you how he's using it and why he's excited about it. ************  By David Petherick LinkedIn has started to roll out full analytics and statistics on your posts made on its publishing platform. (To see if you've got access to your analytics yet, ) If you don't yet have access to your stats, or are not yet writing on LinkedIn, take a look at some of the analytics data available based on some of my recent posts:  First, you can choose any of your past posts to look at, with stats going back up to 6 months on the view graph (although data is held for older posts). You can mouse over specific days to get the actual viewing figure, and can of course see patterns for evergreen content, or when you have shared into a group, see how it brings figures back up for an older post. You can see a performance summary of views, likes, comments and shares, and scrolling further down the page, see which LinkedIn members have viewed, liked, commented and shared - a great way to say thanks, and to note who's being generous with their love for your work. The demographics element further down the page provides fascinating insight - although the demographics don't cover every viewer, only logged in LinkedIn members - you can see what kind of audience is looking at your work. Looking closely above, I never knew I was so popular in Oregon, but I can see for the post detailed that the main traffic came from sharing the article in groups, with only a relatively small boost coming from being featured on the LinkedIn Pulse channel 'LinkedIn Tips'. On other posts, being featured in LinkedIn Pulse has been the main driver. For older articles, my traffic has come largely from Google Search as shown below - which is another good reason I choose headlines with care and ensure I use language and terms I want to be associated with SEO 101. For the last illustration here, I can see exactly who has commented on a specific post, and can visit their profile, or if they are already in my network, send a message directly from the analytics page. I got a lot of traffic from Paris here, because I was writing about an issue to do with French law. Quite why it fascinated so many people in Chicago, I can only guess - but knowing who shared on other articles lets me see who perhaps I should connect with in future. All of this provides me with useful and actionable information: 1.    I can see the audience I am reaching by industry, location and even job title, and see if it aligns with who I am trying to reach 2.    I can see where traffic is being driven from and see where I can try to stimulate more traffic 3.    I can see patterns of visit behavior, and act to share further when traffic starts to tail off 4.    I can engage with and thank the people who have read, liked, commented on or shared my work easily Thanks for the new feature to enhance LinkedIn Publishing, LinkedIn!

What happened next far exceeded all our expectations. We were blown away by the quality and quantity of submissions, and were excited by the strong desire of the community to address some of the most pressing economic issues of our times. As we started to evaluate hundreds of submissions, it was obvious that we needed to increase the number of submissions we’d accept from our original goal to have three winning teams. Once we determined those that met our , we evaluated them based on novelty, impact and feasibility. We were so impressed by those that remained, we accepted almost four times as many proposals as we had originally planned. In the end, we selected 11 finalists to work with us. Each team submitted a compelling proposal to utilize LinkedIn data to create economic opportunity. These teams - the majority of which are comprised of students and professors from prestigious universities - aim to solve problems as diverse as closing employee skill gaps, achieving municipal economic improvements and relieving inequality in the labor market. Their results could potentially positively impact millions of people. Below are the winning teams and their proposals: LinkedIn is a members first organization, and respecting the privacy and upholding the security of our member’s data is something we take very seriously. As such, we planned the Challenge with our members’ privacy and security in mind.

LinkedIn offers a place where we can share our voice – to impart knowledge, help shape opinions, and leave an imprint on the world. Having spent the better part of fifteen years building my career – and my best friend along the way has been LinkedIn. Not only am I inspired by people and their journeys, I’m also able to inspire others hoping to take a similar path. By writing on LinkedIn, I know that my content is reaching the very people who want to read it. My audience has been curated, aggregated, and seamlessly ordered among my groups, followers, and contacts, and I’m always finding great suggestions of new people to network with. It’s the ideal living room from which to share professional content. When my content is read and shared by my network, I’m building my own professional brand alongside that of my company. I check LinkedIn regularly during the day to offer advice on crowdfunding, project ideas, and thought leadership, to see how my posts are doing, and get feedback from my connections. I also enjoy keeping my profile up to date by cataloging my achievements and sharing professional wins – be it a great article in a national newspaper or the successes of Crowdfunder. I’m slightly obsessed with who is looking at my profile – you never know where the next opportunity is coming from – and that “opportunity” may have just been looking at you! My current dream job came to me through LinkedIn. One of the Directors of Crowdfunder found me on LinkedIn and went on to offer me a role with the company – so you can’t get a better opportunity than that! I’ve worked hard in my career and my LinkedIn profile documents each step along my journey. I truly believe that whatever future opportunities will come next will be from the experiences and achievements I’ve shared with the world. I love the fact that my LinkedIn profile is an unfinished story – as my career grows, so will my profile. It’s a pretty brilliant way of keeping a “live CV” (and believe me, I hated having to update my CV when I was younger!). Keep your profile updated, build your network, and be open to opportunities. One of the most frustrating aspects of meeting new people is when I can’t learn more about them because they haven’t updated their profile. If you’re going to be on LinkedIn, make the most of it. When it comes to building my network on LinkedIn, I’ve been quite brave – I’ve often added people I’d like to get in touch with, or people who I think I’ll have business in common with, but I always personalize the message when requesting a connection. I love networking and I love talking business, and LinkedIn has given me incredible opportunities, conversations and a place to share professional content - further expanding my career."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Speaker Series"],"author":"Lauren Hipschman","title":"Purpose Makes the Ordinary Extraordinary: LinkedIn Speaker Series with Mallika Chopra","date":"April 23, 2015","content":"When kicked off our most recent introducing herself as someone who is an irregular meditator, doesn’t care much for yoga, and unwinds with a glass of scotch at the end of a long day.

As the founder and CEO of and author of her most recent book, “ ,” Mallika has been teaching others how to create a path to intent in a real and feasible way. Launching into her story by fundamentally defining how “intents represent who we aspire to be as individuals, members of our community, of our families and citizens of mother earth” I found that my traditional thinking around living life with intent was flawed.  Faced with the questions “Who am I?  What do I want?  How can I serve?” Mallika challenged me to redefine my unique purpose in life. About twenty minutes into Mallika’s talk, I realized that the beginning of a journey to intent starts with the realistic understanding that your purpose doesn’t have to be an earth-shattering, life-changing mission. It can simply be defined by what many would consider ordinary things, such as being a good mother or helping your community. Mallika sums up her journey to discovering how to live life with peace, purpose and joy with the acronym INTENT. After hearing Mallika define intent I realized it was time to stop talking about living with intent, and start actually doing it. As I got my book signed by Mallika following her talk, I found myself redefining what intent meant for me.

In my experience, people are often self-conscious about having their photo taken, particularly a work profile photo. However we now have the luxury of having some pretty smart cameras built into our smartphones, which has made it infinitely easier to snap a great photo in an environment that’s comfortable. Taking a work selfie for your profile photo may sound funny, but it’s really easy and can give you the control and a leading edge. An interview starts the moment someone searches for you online and your first impression is your profile photo. In fact, LinkedIn data has proven that you’re 14 times more likely to be viewed if you have a profile photo. To celebrate the launch of LinkedIn’s New Norms @Work research, I’ve been asked to step in as their #WorkSelfie expert. My challenge? Proving that in the era of smartphones, webcams and selfie sticks, everyone has the ability to take a great professional profile photo! So here are my top tips: Using a background such as a white wall in the office or at home will ensure the focus is purely on your face and not on what is behind you. Make sure the wall is clear of any pictures, signs or people who could photo bomb you! Natural light is your best friend, so stay away from the flash. South-facing windows are perfect, as light will you hit straight on and compliment your face. Avoid direct sunlight as shadows can be harsh on faces. If you know how to use one, putting a DSLR on a tripod and setting the timer function will give you a great quality photo. But don’t disregard your phone, it can give you a great shot if you follow some golden rules. Make sure it’s a fairly recent smartphone (for example, an iPhone 4 or above), find a makeshift tripod (a wall or book shelf) to avoid that awkward selfie arm, and use the main camera on the rear of your phone as the quality of the images will be better. Taking a photo from above can provide a more flattering angle because it tends to emphasize your eyes and makes your face and neck seem smaller. Shooting from below can make some people appear powerful, but it usually makes the chin and nose look prominent, which isn’t a flattering look for most. Gender makes a difference as well - a broad rule of thumb is for women to look up at the camera slightly whereas men tend look better with the camera at eye level. The best photographs follow what’s known as the rule of thirds. This means that your eyes should be one third of the way down from the top of the photo and off to one side. This provides a more interesting photograph and probably a more flattering angle. Also give yourself plenty of distance between yourself and the lens so you can crop the picture later if necessary. And how much of it you want in your photo! Head and shoulders make the best #WorkSelfie, meaning an off-the-shoulder top might not give you quite the right look for your ‘professional brand’. You also don’t want anything too distracting. Don’t be afraid to use colour though; it’s all about mirroring your personality. Duckface, pouting, sparrow face, fishlips, belfie, the bed, the bathroom, the restaurant, the seatbelt, the gym. These are just some of the selfies that don’t have a place on your LinkedIn profile. Show your natural self by relaxing your face and expression. Employers, colleagues and recruiters will quickly be able to tell if your #WorkSelfie is an unnatural or forced version of you. Try a few different expressions, make sure you smile or laugh. This may sound silly but by experimenting, you will get used to how your face looks and feels.

Whether it’s sharing a photo of yourself at a recent conference or a group photo from a team outing, the photos we share with our professional network firmly establish our professional brand and can make or break the first impression of potential employers, clients or partners. Including a profile photo on your LinkedIn profile will make you 14 times more likely to be viewed. Millennials have already mastered this – they change their profile photo on LinkedIn more often than any other demographic, making them the most viewed on LinkedIn. But you don’t have to wait for a session with a high-profile photographer to get a great professional headshot. LinkedIn’s Guest #WorkSelfie Expert, Lee Coles, has some so you can update your professional look as often as you like. Your professional brand is a sum of many different aspects of your professional life, so it’s critical to make sure you are always representing your best self. Anytime you get a promotion or accomplish a career milestone, update your LinkedIn profile. If a colleague shares a professional win with their network, give them a shout out. When you read a relevant industry story, share it and comment on why you agree or disagree with the perspective. And keep your profile photo up-to-date so people will instantly recognize you when you see them in person. Share your LinkedIn profile photo with us by using the hashtag #WorkSelfie."},{"post_categories":["Member Stories","Editorial"],"author":"Janet Matta","title":"Why I Publish on LinkedIn: Inspire the Next Generation of Leaders","date":"April 30, 2015","content":"I spent most of my twenties confused about what I wanted to do with my life, what path I should pursue, how to balance what I thought others wanted from me, how to discover what I wanted (that’s the hardest part!), and how to succeed. I struggled with having the confidence to identify and pursue a career path that I thought would be interesting and impactful. I remember that experience so clearly. I wanted someone to give me answers, and looked to many mentors to help me figure out my professional path. I feel like I'm finally in a place where I do have it figured out, and can support those who are still in that place of uncertainty. I want to be able to give other twenty-somethings the chance to discover what it is they can do to make a difference in the world, and to help others feel relaxed and excited about their professional future. For me, writing and sharing my experiences is one of the most effective ways to accomplish this. I took a risk, I didn’t plan out my first post. I was hearing the same themes over and over again in my career advising work with students, and I thought that I could help many more than just those who made it into my office. I started with because I had a particularly poignant meeting with a student who seemed so uncertain about how she should approach the question of salary in her industry. I remember her saying, “I just feel bad asking for more, y’know?”, and her obvious struggle with confidence and stepping up to propose what she wanted is something that I got really passionate about. It was a golden opportunity to tackle an issue that’s really common in young professionals, how to build and claim an identity as a professional. So I wrote the story of her challenges with confidence and my advice on how to ask for more money. I got such a huge positive response to that first post I knew there was an audience for what I had to share. So I’m still writing! Publishing on LinkedIn has turned out to be an incredible personal career boost. It’s made me more visible to my professional network, and to the base of young people who I’m best able to serve. My recent job opportunity in Sydney came out of my publishing efforts--my boss saw my presence on LinkedIn and my writing, and we brought that up in my interview as an example of how I stay connected and engaged with my professional community. And when I published a , I received media coverage in Australia: my post was republished on and I’ve been a guest on Australian radio with Radio2UE. I was even asked to give an interview recently on the question: “Is the internet killing jobs?”. We talked on the air for 15 minutes about how the internet has changed the world of work, all because of what I’d been writing on LinkedIn. Publishing has undeniably changed and launched my career to an entirely new place (literally!) I have a global reach now that I never had before. I’ve even started a to meet the demand for support that I received in feedback to my writing, and I’ve started working with young people all over the world to help them plan for their professional futures. Get support from others --It was helpful to have someone edit my early pieces so I could refine what I was writing and make it clear and clean for a large readership. I remember my first comments were pointing out typos and lack of formatting in my post (embarrassing, but thankfully I don’t get those anymore!), so share your draft with peers to serve as an extra set of eyeballs (and help give you the confidence boost to hit “Publish”!). Don’t let yourself think about how you might compare to others, because every author has a different voice. The more you write, the better you'll get, and the more impact you'll have. I'm still in awe of how the decision to write for LinkedIn has changed my career, and how many new possibilities it’s created. I wouldn’t be where I am if I hadn’t made that choice."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News"],"author":"Steve Sordello","title":"LinkedIn’s Q1 2015 Earnings","date":"April 30, 2015","content":"Today, we reported our financial results for the first quarter 2015. LinkedIn demonstrated continued solid growth during the first quarter. This performance comes amidst the backdrop of several important strategic investments to better position the business to execute on our long-term roadmap. I highly encourage you to review , including our GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation. [1] I will co-host a with our CEO to discuss our financial results for the first quarter 2015 and business outlook today at 2:00PM Pacific Time. The full transcript of the webcast/conference call can be downloaded from the . See slides below. This post contains non-GAAP financials measures relating to the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures at http://investors.linkedin.com/ and additional details regarding the use of non-GAAP measures below.  This post also contains forward-looking statements about our products, including our investments in products, technology and other key strategic areas, certain non-financial metrics, such as customer and member growth and engagement, and our expected financial metrics such as revenue, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP EPS, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and fully-diluted weighted shares for the second quarter of 2015 and the full fiscal year 2015. The achievement of the matters covered by such forward-looking statements involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, the company’s results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements the company makes. The risks and uncertainties referred to above include - but are not limited to - risks associated with: our limited operating history in a new and unproven market; engagement of our members; the price volatility of our Class A common stock; general economic conditions; expectations regarding the return on our strategic investments; execution of our plans and strategies, including with respect to mobile products and features; security measures and the risk that they may not be sufficient to secure our member data adequately or that we are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of members to access our solutions; expectations regarding our ability to timely and effectively scale and adapt existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that our solutions are accessible at all times with short or no perceptible load times; our ability to maintain our rate of revenue growth and manage our expenses and investment plans; our ability to accurately track our key metrics internally; members and customers curtailing or ceasing to use our solutions; our core value of putting members first, which may conflict with the short-term interests of the business; privacy and changes in regulations, which could impact our ability to serve our members or curtail our monetization efforts; litigation and regulatory issues; increasing competition; our ability to manage our growth; our international operations; our ability to recruit and retain our employees; the application of U.S. and international tax laws on our tax structure and any changes to such tax laws; acquisitions we have made or may make in the future; and the dual class structure of our Class A common stock. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company’s financial results is included in filings it makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and additional information will also be set forth in our Form 10-Q that will be filed for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, which should be read in conjunction with these financial results. These documents are or will be available on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Relations page of the company's website at http://investors.linkedin.com/. All information provided in this post is as of April 30, 2015, and LinkedIn undertakes no duty to update this information. To supplement its condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to peer operating results. Non-cash interest expense related to convertible senior notes. In November 2014, the company issued $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes. In accordance with GAAP, the company separately accounted for the value of the conversion feature as a debt discount, which is amortized in a manner that reflects the company’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, the company recognizes imputed interest expense on its convertible senior notes of approximately 4.7% in its statement of operations. The company excludes the difference between the imputed interest expense and coupon interest expense, net of any capitalized interest, because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Income tax effects and adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by considering the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, the company has implemented a static non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected 10-year weighted average non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect the company's long-term operations. Historically, the company computed a non-GAAP tax rate based on non-GAAP pre-tax income on a quarterly basis. Based on the company's current forecast, a tax rate of 23% has been applied to its non-GAAP financial results for the current period. This rate will be adjusted annually, if necessary. The company believes that adjusting for these income tax effects and adjustments provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from its non-GAAP net income. Dilutive shares under the treasury stock method. During periods with a net loss, the company excluded certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Trended Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in the company’s earnings release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP EPS guidance to net loss or GAAP EPS guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or GAAP provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net loss and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. As items that impact net loss are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net loss is not available without unreasonable effort."},{"post_categories":["Advance Your Career","Featured","LinkedIn Learning"],"author":"Ryan Roslansky","title":"Welcome to the LinkedIn Family, lynda.com!","date":"April 9, 2015","content":"Many people don’t know that I started my first company when I was a freshman in college. I didn’t know the first thing about designing a website and relied on a Lynda Weinman web graphics book to get my site up and running. What I didn’t know at the time was that my experience would come full circle on both a professional and personal level today. As the head of content products at LinkedIn, I spend a lot of time thinking about how the access to information and knowledge can be used to make professionals more productive and successful. The fact that I had to take a crash course to acquire a new professional skill is not unique to me -- millions of professionals around the world are in a constant state of learning to achieve their professional goals every day. So, I couldn’t be more thrilled to welcome the talented team to the LinkedIn family today.

We dash off breezy updates about our vacations, post photos of cocktails, share the latest Jimmy Kimmel “Mean Tweets” segment - almost without a second thought. But when it comes to sharing professional content, people pause. Why is that? Perhaps it’s because we all want to be seen as smart, as an expert in our field. We want to come across as being on top of our game. And we’re not quite sure whether the thing we’re about to share meets that bar. Here’s my advice: get over it! If you feel the comment, article, or post you’re about to create is an interesting and informative one, chances are highly likely your connections will too. Plus, sharing is good for you too - we know that sharing content a few times a week raises your profile views and connection requests. Think about it like this: A quick update with a link to an article, video or LinkedIn post helps keep you top of mind. Like stopping by someone’s desk to say hello, it’s a light touch way to stay top of mind with your connections and to give them a sense of what you care about. It sparks tangential conversations too. Not so long ago, I got pinged by an old colleague who’d seen an article I shared. Did he want to chat about it? Not remotely. But it spurred him to reach out and ask for my thoughts and advice on his next play outside the company. It was great to reconnect with him and even better to be helpful. When you share something valuable, others get value from it. You help your connections sift through the noise of millions of articles, to find the ones that will matter to them. For example, I loved on the forces that shape you as a Silicon Valley product manager. It’s still relevant for experienced product managers - but it’s especially salient for someone just starting out. If you see something and think, “I wish I’d known that when…”, share it. In , Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg outline the concept of “smart creatives” - which resonated with me. It’s the idea that it’s not enough to be the person who comes in and does the job by rote, mechanically finishing one task after the other. You have to be intellectually curious and ambitious to push on new ways of doing things, with the courage to pull it off. Think about a young Steve Jobs taking calligraphy and then applying those lessons in elegance and spacing to Mac typography. Maybe you’re an engineer who was inspired by a piece you read on Picasso’s technique. When you share something smart and engaging, particularly off the beaten path, it’s another way to let people know you have an intellectual pulse and the capacity to stretch. This week, take a few moments each day to share something you’ve read and comment on someone else’s updates. See what goodness accrues."},{"post_categories":["Product News","Featured","New LinkedIn Features"],"author":"Will Sun","title":"Introducing LinkedIn Elevate: Helping Companies Empower Their Employees To Share Content","date":"April 13, 2015","content":"Lots of professionals share content – like articles, blog posts, and presentations – on social and professional networks to strengthen their professional brands. And lots of companies share content on social and professional networks to attract talent, and market and sell their products and services. But relatively few companies recognize that when they empower their employees to be social professionals, they not only change the trajectory of their employees’ careers, they change the trajectory of their businesses as well. For example, when a LinkedIn member shares six pieces of content, on average, they receive six profile views and make two new connections, which helps them strengthen their professional brands. At the same time, the company they work for receives six job views, three Company Page views, and one Company Page follower, which helps them better hire, market, and sell. Despite that, our research shows that only 2% of employees share content their company has shared on LinkedIn. Yet they drive tremendous value. They’re responsible for about 20% of the overall engagement  – clicks, likes, comments, and shares – that content receives. That’s not surprising given employees have 10 times more connections than their company has followers, and people tend to be considered more authentic than companies. So why aren’t more companies empowering their employees to be social professionals? Because they lack the tools needed to easily and effectively curate content, suggest it to the right employees, and measure the impact on the bottom line. That’s why I’m excited to introduce LinkedIn Elevate – a new product that helps companies and employees high-quality content, easily to social networks, and the impact. LinkedIn Elevate combines algorithmic recommendations from and , and human curation, to equip employees with a ready stream of relevant content they can share. Sharing is simple with the LinkedIn Elevate iOS, Android, and desktop apps. Employees can easily share content on LinkedIn and Twitter, and take advantage of LinkedIn Elevate’s intelligent scheduling capabilities to ensure their content gets shared when their networks are most active. LinkedIn Elevate features powerful analytics for employees and companies. Employees can see how many times content they’ve shared has been liked, commented on, and reshared, and how many people it reached. Soon they’ll get even more insights, like who viewed their profile and requested to connect as a result of the content they shared. LinkedIn Elevate provides companies with the same data, as well as numerous micro-conversions – like job views and Company Page followers – and results that impact the bottom-line – like hires, leads, and sales. Adobe, Quintiles, Unilever and several other companies piloted LinkedIn Elevate in Q1. Employees who participated in the pilot shared six times more often than in the months leading up to the pilot. As a result, Quintiles employees who participated in the pilot received four times more profile views and made two times more connections, and Unilever employees drove four times more Company Page views, two times more Company Page followers, and six times more job views. , head of Adobe’s Social Business Center of Excellence, led Adobe’s pilot of LinkedIn Elevate. Here’s what he had to say: “This product helps our employees start social conversations about Adobe and the industries we serve. Adobe employees who participated in the LinkedIn Elevate pilot drove 80 percent more Adobe job views than they did previously and in February alone, each participant drove three to four new trial downloads for Adobe solutions. Our employees want to be active on social media, and LinkedIn Elevate offers an easy platform to provide them with insightful content that they will want to share.” LinkedIn Elevate is available today by invitation only, and will be generally available by Q3. to learn more about LinkedIn Elevate and how you can empower your employees to be social professionals."},{"post_categories":["Member Stories","Editorial"],"author":"Robbie Abed","title":"Why I Publish on LinkedIn: The Power of Storytelling","date":"April 15, 2015","content":"Career advice always sounds the same: meet the right people, don’t play office politics, work hard, and do good work. It all means nothing in the end unless you can relate it to your specific situation. Telling someone to always negotiate their salary is different than someone telling a story about how they managed to negotiate their salary when the company wasn’t offering raises as an option. I share my experiences rather than generic career advice because the chance to make an impact is greater. After I published , a post about how not being able to afford my groceries in the checkout line sparked a determination in me that led to my first job, I received hundreds of InMails, connection requests and emails from professionals around the world, with many people sharing the ways in which my story resonated with them. Many of them mentioned that because of that post, they could finally relax knowing that someone else has been through that situation and succeeded. I write about career advancement, and I had never really found a platform that allowed me to reach my exact audience--professionals looking for their next career move and business founders. So, when LinkedIn gave me the opportunity to publish content to my network, I jumped all over it. The audience was a perfect fit and I was able to reach a wider professional audience than ever before. I received messages all the way from New Zealand to Hawaii about how they appreciated what I wrote and how it impacted them. It was amazing to see how much my writing resonated with not only professionals in the US, but with professionals around the world. After publishing on LinkedIn, I had senior executives reach out to me because of my writing. In some cases it was to set up a meeting, in others it was just a note to say that they enjoyed reading what I had to say. Some of them had upwards of 20 more years of experience than I do and it was something that had never happened to me, ever. Making those connections has been great, but the biggest opportunity that has come from publishing on LinkedIn is meeting my idol and LinkedIn Influencer . I’ve always admired James because it was through reading his work that I learned to “bleed on the page.” He’s the reason I write so authentically and candidly. When I reached out to him for coffee a huge part of the reason he agreed to meet was because he saw my writing on LinkedIn--specifically my post about how I took . It was amazing to connect with each other through writing on LinkedIn, and now he’s a mentor of mine. The biggest hesitation I hear from people when I tell them to start writing on LinkedIn is, “I don’t know what I will write about.” People hold back because they don't think what they have to say is unique. But if you want to build your brand, if you want to get your name out there, you need to take that step and put yourself out there. And it doesn't have to be perfect. Pick an experience from your past and write what you’ve learned about it. Chances are, you aren’t the only one who has experienced it. I think you’ll be amazed by the feedback."},{"post_categories":["New LinkedIn Features","LinkedIn API"],"author":"Bob Rosin","title":"Bringing the Power of LinkedIn Into Your Yahoo Mail Experience","date":"April 16, 2015","content":"Wouldn’t it be great to learn a bit more about the people you’re emailing with every day so you can be more productive?

Nothing made me happier than to explore new ideas and see first-hand how different cultures and perspectives view the world. Throughout my 18 year corporate career, however, I didn’t feel like I had an outlet to share my ideas openly or build discussion. I faced some challenges coming up the ranks as a woman, at times feeling totally isolated and alone. I wanted to focus on what I loved most--working with concepts and ideas – exploring them and moving them forward to build something powerful. So, I decided to leave the corporate world to pursue my passion--helping women succeed in the workplace. And now, after 10 years as a speaker and career success coach, I’ve had the opportunity to connect with thousands of women and share knowledge on how we can thrive in our careers. Writing is a huge part of that for me. When one lone person speaks up and shares their candid opinion about something, they’re actually representing thousands upon thousands of people who feel the same way. Publishing  on LinkedIn makes that type of impact possible. It allows people to make their voices heard. I’ve been able to reach millions of people who in many ways are my “tribe” – people who are experiencing the same types of challenges, issues and questions that I did (and do) in my professional life – and sharing new ways to look at these challenges and navigate through them. I’m doing work that I love and offering some transformative help in the process. A few of my posts have reached more than a million views and connected me with new partners, projects, speaking engagements, and writing opportunities. After publishing , I was invited to join The Comedy Cellar Show on Sirius XM for an eye-opening discussion on toxic behaviors. And it’s helped me connect with thousands of people around the world who are interested in the same issues as I am. The comments I receive really touch me, such as this recent comment from Sharnee Bennett in Australia who wrote: Don’t be scared. Use your voice. Find it. Everyone on the planet has something important to say – critical experiences to share that are helpful to others, and that emerge from their unique perspectives, filters, histories, passions, traumas, and triumphs. When we share our ideas, challenges, and our perspectives more openly and publicly, it can be a truly life-changing experience."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Mobile","Featured","Android"],"author":"Daniel Ayele","title":"Hey Job Seeker, It’s Time To Get Up And Get Hired","date":"March 19, 2015","content":"The world of job seeking can be all consuming.

We have some exciting news to share today for the latter group, but first, a little story. In March 2009, I was working as a Product Marketing Manager in an 80-person Israeli software company that develops software solutions for travel businesses. After two years in the role, I was ready for my next play and was looking for ways to accelerate my career towards my longer term goal - building great consumer products that would improve the lives of millions of people around the world in a meaningful way. Like many other recent graduates and young professionals, I had to decide between extending my higher education (going to graduate school) or pursuing more practical experiences. It was a tough choice, but ultimately, I chose grad school. It was the right decision for me, but it opened the door to a new challenge - determining which school was right for me. No two graduate programs are the same. Going in, you should have an idea of what kind of investment will be required, both in terms of time and finances. Be prepared to ask questions - what have other graduates gone on to do? Who hires graduates like me? What are the top schools for my area of interest?

In addition to his take on the future of , Aasif got serious with us how about how he was able to succeed in the ever-competitive entertainment industry and build a strong professional brand. Here are some highlights he shared that might help you in your career: – “My dad’s dream was to be a doctor and he was never able to go to medical school even though he got the grades, because his father couldn’t afford to send him.” Aasif’s dad became an entrepreneur out of necessity and ended up doing something he wasn’t as good at doing because it wasn’t what he loved. Aasif didn’t want to do that in his life and decided to pursue his own dream of acting no matter what. – Aasif shared a pivotal “ah ha” moment that he learned on the film set. Used to the normal cushiony Hollywood set filled with tons of prep time and direction, Aasif found himself on a bare bones independent set. When a fellow actor noticed that he was ruffled by the lack of normal prep he was accustomed to, he encouraged Aasif to stop hiding behind the shields of prep work, just live in the moment, and “do your work.” Aasif credits this as some of the strongest advice he received along the way. – We all have negative voices inside telling us we can’t achieve whatever we’ve set out to do. Aasif refers to this as the voice of treason, “and to do battle against that voice, is in many ways what life is all about.” Aasif believes, while it never fully leaves you, over time the voice of treason will help you become your greater self. – Some of Aasif’s most was about finding your unique path to success –“you really need to carve out your own journey and your own path, and that really means coming from your own truth and that might be a different truth than mine, a different journey.” Aasif feels that it’s a tremendous gift to be a creative individual and that he strives – and encourages everyone – to keep creating and doing. When he first joined he told Jon Stewart that his new office space was his first and was an upgrade from the typical actor trailers. Jon’s response stayed with Aasif – he told him he was no longer an actor but a “creative being with influence,” which Aasif now works to incorporate in every step of his journey. – “You go in with as much preparedness as you can, and then you have to let it all go.” An acting teacher once told Aasif, “be as prepared as you can be, and then when you walk out on stage, forget all the preparation, and just live.” Whether that be an actual stage, a meeting, a pitch – forget everything you studied in advance, and just live. Going with whatever comes to you in the moment. For more tips and inspiration from Aasif, check out the full video below.

Today, colleges and universities may invite their graduates to showcase their degrees and certificates on their LinkedIn profiles - all with the simple click of a button. Through LinkedIn’s Add-to-Profile program, educational institutions can embed a simple link on their websites and in emails sent directly to graduates. When graduates click that “Add-to-Profile” button, they’ll have the option to add that achievement directly to the “Education” section of her LinkedIn profile by previewing it and just hitting “Save”. For students, adding a degree or certificate to their LinkedIn profiles is both smart and straightforward. People whose profiles include an education get an average of 10x the profile views of those who don’t - and more visibility frequently translates to more opportunities, from connection requests to job possibilities. With the Add-to-Profile option, they can update their profiles - without being on LinkedIn itself. For colleges, universities and certificate providers, the Add-to-Profile button is a helpful service to offer students and a low-effort way to stay connected with them over the long term. Any educational institution may now incorporate the button on its website for free and begin sending emails to students and graduates by following the easy instructions Currently, LinkedIn is working with 13 participating colleges and universities: Arizona State University; Kaplan University; University of California, San Diego; Villanova University; George Washington University; Full Sail University; University of Manchester; University of Cambridge; Universitas Indonesia; The Open University; Algonquin College; Keio University; and the University of Melbourne.

On average, 16% of new hires were already connected to someone at the company prior to joining. For example, if your company hired 100 people, then on average, 16 of those new hires were connected to someone at your company they came onboard.

What if your new boss is worse than your last? Or what if staying is simply no longer an option, but you have no idea what to do next? Whether you’re about to make the leap or you’re still plotting your escape, our latest series on LinkedIn, “I Quit!”, highlights all the right — and wrong — ways to leave a job. From Influencers like Richard Branson and Suze Orman to LinkedIn members whose quitting videos have gone viral, we take a closer look at the inspiration (and occasional mayhem) that comes with moving on. And what if the grass isn’t greener on the other side? Take heart: Influencers like and ex-GE exec Robert Nardelli reveal how they each left a company on such great terms that they were welcomed back years later. From summoning the courage to jump ship to informing your boss and colleagues, what's the best way to (gracefully) leave a job? How should you respond if your company guilt-trips you to stay? Or if you were fired, how do you position your departure?

For the first time, Orman describes what prompted her to end her show on a high note: “There was no external trigger; just a feeling that I had shifted, not the workplace... Could I have ignored that feeling? Sure. But that would have been so disrespectful. To myself, and most of all to the viewers.” While most of our departures won’t warrant such public scrutiny, many of us can relate to the inertia of familiarity — and the gradual realization that it's time to make room for new challenges. As Orman points out: As the boss, has seen top employees come and go, and he knows better than to begrudge them for leaving. “One of the great things about Virgin is that when talented people leave us, they often go on to create their own brilliant businesses,” . “We’ve all stayed friends, and I’m sure there will be opportunities for us to collaborate further in the future.” Whether you’re quitting a job or giving up on a dream, perhaps we can all learn from the startup mentality of pivoting.

But when my job as a diversity director was eliminated during the 2009 economic crisis, I was determined that this was going to be an opportunity, not a calamity. Once I absorbed the shock of the layoff, I took stock of the positives. I had spent a lot of time in corporate America in human resources and recruiting positions, so I had many contacts. Of course, I was now a job seeker, so I was on the other side of the fence, trying to get the attention of recruiters. That was my eureka moment: I saw a chance to reverse engineer all my knowledge about hiring, and help other job hunters fine-tune their searches and get their dream jobs. So, I pivoted from looking for a new job to starting my own business, , and I’ve never looked back. Naturally, going from a laid-off worker to a successful business owner didn’t happen overnight. I decided to use LinkedIn to tell my career story, so the first thing I did was make sure that I created a complete and robust LinkedIn profile. I began doing contract work for human resources departments at large companies, so I was able to add those projects to my profile as well, showing that I was staying in the game. Now that I’m helping job seekers navigate their searches, I use LinkedIn daily. It’s the first thing I look at in the morning – checking up on news, and seeing what my connections are up to. I now spend hours each day on LinkedIn attempting to learn every bell and whistle so that I can be an even better resource for my clients. For example, I tell them that they can’t even begin to search for a job on LinkedIn until their profile is as strong (and professional) as it can be. Why is this point so important? Because a half-completed profile is like answering the doorbell wearing a bathrobe – it leaves the impression you’re not prepared for what’s next. I always tell clients that a good photo also helps the professional feel of a profile – no selfies or vacation photos, please! The best way to get a good profile photo is, of course, to hire a – but if your budget doesn’t allow that, ask a friend to take several dozen pictures of you with a cell phone or good point-and-shoot camera, and don’t stop until you have a few professional-looking choices.

Recently, we discovered they’re doing something else: searching for coworkers. About 30% of members who search for people on LinkedIn each month view their coworkers’ profiles. Why? Good question! What we’ve heard from members is that the professional information on LinkedIn is more comprehensive and up-to-date than most companies’ intranets, and it’s easier to search for coworkers on LinkedIn -- especially if you don’t have their first and last name. This trend interests us so much that we’re exploring all the ways we can make it even easier for you and other members to find coworkers on LinkedIn -- including developing a new app. Today, I want to provide some tips and tricks to help you search for, and find, coworkers on LinkedIn. Let’s say I just returned from LinkedIn’s annual product off-site where I met a coworker on our corporate communications team who previously worked at Edelman and went to the University of Arizona. I want to get his input on something I’m working on, but can’t remember his name. There are a few ways I can find him on LinkedIn. Here are two of my favorite: I can simply enter all of the information I know about him into the search bar atop the LinkedIn homepage -- LinkedIn Edelman University of Arizona. The way you order the words doesn’t matter. Just throw them in there, and then click the magnifying glass to the right of the search bar. Search scours LinkedIn and provides me with a list of profiles that include all those words. And there you go… the coworker I’m looking for, Joe Roualdes, appeared atop my search results! Alternatively, I can enter just my coworker’s employer, LinkedIn, into the search bar. A drop down menu will appear that includes “Jobs at LinkedIn,” “People who work at LinkedIn,” and “People who used to work at LinkedIn.” Since I’m searching for my coworker, I click on “People who work at LinkedIn.” Search scours LinkedIn again, but this time provides me with the profiles of everyone who works at LinkedIn. I need to focus my search, so I use the additional features to the left of the page under the black “Search” box. I click “Past Company” and a drop down menu will appear. Edelman isn’t an option, so I click “Add” and type “Edelman” into the search bar. I click “Edelman” and my search results automatically update. Then I click “School.” The University of Arizona appears, so I simply check that box, and my search results automatically update again. There’s Joe! If you try both search options and your coworker doesn’t appear in your search results, here’s another tip: Look at the LinkedIn profile of another coworker who has a similar title, or works on the same team or in the same division as the person you’re trying to find. Now scroll down. There are two sections to the right of their profile called “Others with similar positions at (company name)” and “People also viewed.” Here is what those two sections look like: These sections, as advertised, show you coworkers with similar titles, and related profiles that people also viewed. Chances are you’ll find the coworker you’re looking for in one of these sections.

The achievement of the matters covered by such forward-looking statements involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, the company’s results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements the company makes.

Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company’s financial results is included in filings it makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, as well as the company's most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, and additional information will also be set forth in our Form 10-K that will be filed for the year ended December 31, 2014, which should be read in conjunction with these financial results. These documents are or will be available on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Relations page of the company's website at http://investors.linkedin.com/. All information provided in this post is as of February 5, 2015, and LinkedIn undertakes no duty to update this information. To supplement its condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to peer operating results. Non-cash interest expense related to convertible senior notes. In November 2014, the company issued $1,323 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes. In accordance with GAAP, the company separately accounted for the value of the conversion feature as a debt discount, which is amortized in a manner that reflects the company’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, the company recognizes imputed interest expense on its convertible senior notes of approximately 4.7% in its statement of operations. The company excludes the difference between the imputed interest expense and coupon interest expense, net of any capitalized interest, because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Income tax effects and adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by considering the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, the company has implemented a static non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected 10-year weighted average non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect our long-term operations. Historically, the company computed a non-GAAP tax rate based on non-GAAP pre-tax income on a quarterly basis. Based on the company's current forecast, a tax rate of 25% will be applied to its non-GAAP financial results beginning in the first quarter of 2015. This rate will be adjusted annually, if necessary. The company believes that adjusting for these income tax effects and adjustments provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from its non-GAAP net income. Dilutive shares under the treasury stock method. During periods with a net loss, the company excluded certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Trended Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in in our earnings release, which can be found at http://investors.linkedin.com/. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP EPS guidance to net income (loss) or GAAP EPS guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or GAAP provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. As items that impact net income (loss) are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net income (loss) is not available without unreasonable effort."},{"post_categories":["Featured","LinkedIn for Good"],"author":"Meg Garlinghouse","title":"The New Professional Norm: 10+ Million Professionals on LinkedIn Make Social Impact Part of Their Identity [INFOGRAPHIC]","date":"February 10, 2015","content":"Last month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Richard Branson and E&Y announced illustrating that corporate purpose goes beyond financial results. There is no question that the role of corporations and even more specifically professionals has evolved considerably over the last few decades. A generation ago, most professionals did not begin to think about “making an impact” until the sunset of their careers. Now – at the sunrise of their careers and mostly driven by Millennials – young professionals are insisting that they integrate purpose into the workplace. They want to make an impact not just on weekends or once a year, but as an integral part of their work experience and identity. And our data reflects this. Just over three years ago, we added the “Volunteer and Causes” section to the LinkedIn profile.

So it shouldn’t come as a huge surprise that there are now over  to their LinkedIn profiles – sharing the incredible work they’ve done and highlighting the causes and organizations they care most about. That’s up from three million just a year ago.

As a young professional in my 20s working in the private sector, I often struggle with this notion. I’ve always considered myself someone who cares deeply about community and youth empowerment. But what a huge contradiction it is to claim this while spending Monday to Friday juxtaposed between catered meals and ping pong tables. Sure, I try to justify it by working for a company with a socially driven vision, but is that not an oxymoron in and of itself? For me, John’s words provoked an influx of thoughts and emotions like these. But most importantly, it helped me see the bigger picture.

He leads an organization called whose mission it is to make free enterprise work for everyone through financial literacy, financial capability, and financial dignity. His speech touched on topics ranging from global human suffrage to racial discrimination, but each subject was grounded in his dream of achieving equal economic opportunity. And with 70% of companies in America employing less than 500 workers, he asserts that small businesses may be the best way to achieve it in the US. The picture John painted of our economy really struck a chord with me because I clearly saw the part LinkedIn can play in fulfilling this dream of equal economic opportunity. Our vision at LinkedIn is to provide economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. If realized, this type of data can give real time insights to underrepresented communities about what jobs and skills are most in demand in their area and then we’ll be able to serve up actionable recommendations for the best skills and certifications needed to attain them. Ultimately, I think his message helped validate the opportunity that really is in front of me, and the role I can play in it. The fact that I work for a company with a “socially driven vision” is much more than a justification to rest my conscience. It serves as a point of inspiration. It serves as a reminder that every task I do ultimately maps back to a larger purpose.

If you look at his NFL player card it says he is 6’2” but he is probably closer to 6’0” or 6’1”. Other great quarterbacks like Tom Brady and Peyton Manning are 6’5”. Due to being a ‘vertically challenged’ quarterback up against a wall of very tall offensive lineman, Steve found himself faced with a very real problem - he couldn’t see. Because he couldn’t see, he couldn’t throw. And because he couldn’t throw, the offense couldn’t move in typical 49er style. In his struggle to find the solution (even trying to add padding in his shoes to make him taller), Steve realized that he knew his teammates and the routes they ran so well that he didn’t have to actually see them in order to get the ball to them. In other words, he was throwing blind. This innovative solution to a very difficult problem led Steve to become the highest rated NFL quarterback of all time. The year Steve took over the quarterback duties for the 49ers, things didn’t go as well as he had hoped. After a failed play, Steve would explain very clearly what happened – and it was rarely his fault. Either the ball was muddy, a block was missed - allowing a player from the other team to hit him as he threw the ball, the receiver turned the wrong way, among myriad other reasons. Despite his very clear explanation about the reasons for the failure, his team would head to the sidelines and, when the coach would ask what happened, the responses varied but they may as well have all been the same: “Well, he’s not Joe Montana.” Steve was consistently compared to his predecessor, Joe Montana, who had won four Super Bowls with the 49ers. Then one day on a flight from Salt Lake City, Steve sat next to and received some poignant advice from Stephen R. Covey, author of the best-selling book “The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.” This advice helped Steve see accountability and teamwork in a completely different way. He went back to his team and instead of explaining what went wrong he understood that “the ball was in my hand and now it’s in [the other team’s] hand. It’s my fault. I did it. But I’ll tell you what we’re going to do: We’re going to go to the sidelines, we’ll get a drink of water, we’ll rest up, we’ll come back on the field, and we’ll go down and win the game. What do you say?” That single act of personal accountability infused accountability into the rest of his team and can be a very good lesson for accountability as we lead our own teams at work. After winning and being named MVP of Super Bowl XXIX, Steve, like other Super Bowl MVP’s before him, announced to the world that he was going to Disneyland. Little did he know, he was actually going to Disneyland. The very next day, he was standing next to Mickey Mouse on a float on Main Street Disneyland. Steve was completely caught up in the euphoric moment as praise was being heaped on him from the bystanders. When the float turned the corner and the moment was fading into memory, Steve saw two little boys dressed alike staring at the float. The little boys’ eyes were big and with looks of awe on their faces - as Steve expected one last moment of praise, the younger of the two yelled in awe “Mickey Mouse!” Then his brother pulled him back and said, “You can’t get near him, the big guy won’t let you.” In the blink of an eye, Steve went from national hero to Mickey Mouse’s bodyguard. The point of Steve’s story was for everyone to remember that while big goals are an important part of being successful in life, it is important to remember that life goes on after attaining that goal. We all have to transition to our next play. Steve successfully transitioned to his next play in private equity where he is now co-founder and managing director of Huntsman Gay Global Capital - a firm with over $1.1 billion under active management. He also founded the Forever Young Foundation, an organization that serves children with physical, emotional, and financial difficulties. Steve’s personable style and behind the scenes insight into his personal journey as NFL MVP father made this speaker series especially meaningful for me."},{"post_categories":["Featured","New LinkedIn Features"],"author":"Akshay Kothari","title":"LinkedIn Reaches One Million Member Posts, Opens Publishing to New Markets","date":"January 7, 2015","content":" Early last year, we gave every LinkedIn member in the U.S. the ability to publish posts on LinkedIn - and the response was swift and enthusiastic.

You can instantly tell if someone is struggling or succeeding and iterate to make things work more smoothly. Always ask, 'What do you need from me?'\"  ******* Even if it feels like you'll never find enough time in the day, invite your new colleagues to lunch. “It’s not about the lunch and it doesn’t have to be lunch,” writes. “What you are doing is listening.

My “in a nutshell” answer is that a Premium membership aims to accelerate results by unlocking our most powerful features for our members. Whether it’s landing your next job, growing your network, securing a lead, or making a new hire for your business, we help you achieve these outcomes more quickly and efficiently. I categorize Premium features into three buckets: tools, insights, and branding. Our networking tools help you find and contact the right people – for example, InMail and additional search filters. Premium insights arm members with competitive intel like who is viewing your profile or how a particular company’s hiring is trending and how you rank among fellow job applicants. Lastly, branding refers to the features that help Premium members stand out and get found such as a 2x larger listing in search results. Overall, these features give you a more powerful LinkedIn experience and a competitive edge to achieve your goals. Simplification is a big focus for us. We know members have been overwhelmed by the many different Premium offerings we’ve had in the past, so we have spent the past few months really focused on streamlining our portfolio. This means, today we offer just that are aligned to specific objectives, such as job seeking, professional networking, sales, and recruiting. We want members to have a crystal clear understanding of the packages available to them and the value they get for each. This is something we will continue to focus on into the new year and will be spending time to evaluate the new ways we can add even more value to the Premium experience. We will also continue to build on the features our Premium members have come to rely on. For example, we recently enhanced the we provide such as Applicant Insights and Company Insights to give insider access to information that can help you focus on the right opportunities, perfect your job search strategy, and ultimately land your dream job faster. You can expect to see more insights that give our members even deeper intel about companies they’re interested in, how they stack up against other job applicants, etc. One tip I always try to share with members is to make the most of the Who’s Viewed Your Profile tool. Yes, it’s fun to see the people who are checking you out, but it can also be a powerful networking vehicle. If you see that someone has viewed your profile, it gives you an easy “in” for reaching out to them. For example, if you notice a recruiter of a company you’re interested in has visited your profile, you have a warm lead to reach out to them and follow up on possible opportunities. The same idea applies for customer acquisition or hiring candidates. Also, if you look at the full list of who’s viewed your profile in the past 90 days (my plug for a Premium account), you can get a very good sense of how you’re being perceived in the ecosystem. You’ll notice trends in the types of people that are viewing your profile and you can make changes to your profile if you realize you’re not catching the attention of your desired audience. Something a lot of people don’t know about me is that my name was not actually Gyanda for the first few years of my life. I was originally named Kanishka, but, as a toddler, I fell very ill and, during that time, a commercial airliner named Kanishka crashed. My grandparents thought this combination of events was a bad omen and decided to change my name. It was quite confusing as a young child to suddenly be called a completely new name!"},{"post_categories":["Privacy"],"author":"Sara Harrington","title":"Privacy and Data Protection Review of LinkedIn Ireland: Some New Features To Know About","date":"December 18, 2014","content":"At LinkedIn, we are grateful for the trust of our members.  We believe that trust is earned by taking privacy and security seriously every day and by being transparent with you about how we use your personal data. LinkedIn recognizes the Office of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner (IDPC) as our lead regulator on data protection and privacy practices in Europe. The IDPC came to us in 2013 with a request to review our practices in these areas. Since May 2013, we have actively engaged with the IDPC in a full audit of our data protection and privacy practices. [1]  The IDPC’s audit efforts were comprehensive and included on-site visits, interviews with dozens of our staff, code review, and examinations of policies and practices related to data privacy and security. The audit was completed in July 2014. Following this review, the IDPC noted our strong commitment to respecting the privacy rights of our members. It also made a number of best practice recommendations about how we could enhance our data protection and privacy practices. LinkedIn embraces many of the IDPC’s recommendations and believes that they will largely improve your experience by providing you with increased clarity, consistency and control. Nearly all of the best practice recommendations that we have agreed to take action on have already been put in place as part of our ongoing product development process, including our updated , which became effective on October 23, 2014. More will be completed before the end of the year.  In some cases, we went beyond the best practice recommendations to do more, such as our adding a self-service tool for you to request the data that LinkedIn has about you. Because these improvements can benefit members all over the world, not just in Europe, these changes are effective globally. We will continue to work to ensure that we maintain our high standards of privacy and data protection for you, including engaging on an on-going basis with the IDPC. Below is an overview of the changes that we believe will most benefit you. In some cases, you will see these changes when you visit the site. In other cases, the changes made are “behind the scenes” improvements that provide additional privacy and security protections for you.  We believe that it is important to be transparent with you about the personal data we gather about you.   We wanted to make it easier for you to access and remove your data from LinkedIn if you wish.  Many of our members come to LinkedIn to be found for opportunities and to connect and share with other professionals. We wanted to be clearer about who can find you and see what you post, share, and follow on LinkedIn. We plan more improvements to our settings in the future.  Many of our members choose to upload their address books so that they can find and connect with people – one of the main reasons members use LinkedIn. We wanted to be clearer about how to build your network and choose who to include in it.  Like many online services, we depend on “cookies” to deliver our services and to serve relevant ads to you. We wanted to be clearer about the cookies we use.  We take the protection of your personal information very seriously. We have added additional security to protect your private data.

It is equally important that you know about and have control over the access third parties have to data about you.  Simpler is better.

This study was recently presented at this year’s , a Conference on Social Informatics in Barcelona, Spain. I co-authored this paper with , who at the time was a Computational Social Science PhD student at Stanford University, to increase our understanding of the evolution of professional migration over the last couple of decades. The research also benefited from external advisors such as , a UW assistant professor of sociology and fellow of the UW eScience Institute, and , a professor of sociology at ETH Zurich. This research leveraged various aspects of to understand trends in migration patterns and mobility of human capital. The Economic Graph is a digital mapping of the global economy, comprised of a profile for every professional, company, job opportunity, the skills required to obtain those opportunities, every higher education organization, and all the professionally relevant knowledge associated with each of these entities. This study aimed to measure highly-skilled, rather than overall, migration flows. We define highly-skilled migrants to be people who have bachelor’s, master’s, or PhD degrees achieved by the time of migration. By using aggregate data from millions of members in hundreds of countries, this study yielded the most comprehensive and up-to-date picture of international flows of highly-skilled migrants. Respecting the privacy of LinkedIn’s members was a primary concern. To this end, we used algorithms to generate the aggregate dataset that was used in the study. Aggregate data in this form is free from any personally identifiable information. Though the analysis confirms that the United States, in absolute terms, continues to be the top destination for international migrants, it presents strong evidence towards a fundamental shift. The results reveal a decline in the probability of employment-seeking migrants with a bachelor’s, master’s, or a PhD degree at the time of migration choosing the US as a destination. In addition, although a similar trend for international students can be observed, there is a recent uptick in their likelihood of going to the United States. While the study did not aim to identify the reasons for this change in global migrations, two interesting facts can be observed: (1) Europe and Canada have seen a much gentler decline in professional migrants compared to the US, and (2) Australia, Africa, Latin America and, above all, Asia, have emerged as more prominent migration destinations for professionals. This pattern fits with an overall trend of a multi-polar realignment of the world economy, the so-called “rise of the rest.” Very large datasets, such as the one used in this study, have the potential to reshape both science and policy in innumerable ways, especially in combination with existing data sources. This study intended to provide a step in this direction by analyzing highly-skilled migrations using social media data. Highly-skilled migration is an important demographic phenomenon with relevant consequences, for instance, in terms of human capital formation, a central issue in the study of economic development.

Last month, we had that transformed their career paths. What became clear was the likelihood of change and transition that occurs during a person’s career as they continue down their professional path. Making a career change can be one of the more difficult professional challenges we face. In many cases, our networks help us make these decisions. We often seek the help of friends, colleagues, and mentors to provide guidance (and often times give us a boost in confidence) in our careers. Our networks can also help provide insight on potential career paths and put us in touch with the relevant knowledge to decide which career path to take or when to make a career transition. For instance, if I’m currently focused on a career in data analytics, is there a path for me to work in software development? To help those of you looking to make a career transition, we mined the data found in millions of LinkedIn member profiles, isolated instances where members made career jumps, and put together an interactive graph that shows the most common transitions that occur between careers. With this information, you can see what transitions are possible for your career, and perhaps find the right person to talk to in your network to get some advice. The result is a snapshot of today’s professional ecosystem. Each dot represents a career, and the lines connecting the dots represent career transitions. You can select a career from the dropdown menu to see the most common transitions that members in that industry have made. Admittedly, there is going on, so I’ll take a moment to provide an explanation. First, careers that experience a high degree of overlap in their transitions are grouped together and assigned the same color. This is often, but not always, related to a particular business function (e.g. sales, marketing, finance, etc.). Second, the size of the dot represents the number of distinct careers that transition into it. (More on this later...) Finally, the thickness of the lines represent the number of members who have made that particular transition. The thinnest lines indicate transitions of only a few hundred members, while the thickest lines indicate tens of thousands of members.

For those who haven’t heard about this global initiative, annually in December, LinkedIn gives all its employee a free job posting and free volunteer posting (valued at ~$450 USD) to *gift* to their favorite nonprofit. For us, this wasn’t just a $450 gift. This was an opportunity to strategically expand our recruitment efforts. In the past we had relied on word of mouth, working with veteran organizations, and national news stories to further our recruitment. But because of my recent experience in corporate recruiting and this timely opportunity, we decided to expand our efforts and started searching for the professional volunteer. It was so simple -- we said ‘ ,’ and then a number of LinkedIn employees selected the Mission Continues; within weeks we received free skilled volunteer posting codes and instructions via email. We were posting and receiving applications by the end of the month. These postings helped us specifically target candidates in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, two of our focus cities. Because our program engages veterans to become involved in service in their communities, veterans have the opportunity to serve at a variety of places ranging from disaster response organizations to homeless shelters or after school programs. After reviewing inquiries and applications, eight veterans joined our program and moved into successful six month Fellowships at local nonprofits.

Making a professional connection in some ways is a simple action, but it’s a simple action that can have a profound impact on a person’s education and career. At LinkedIn we’re working on making connections deeper and more meaningful by developing the - a digital map of the global economy. We believe that the Economic Graph will help amplify the effectiveness and impact of connections by forming ties between people and also among companies, jobs, skills, educational organizations, and professional knowledge. With these broader and deeper connections we believe that individuals and organizations can find and create more economic opportunity, which is one of the biggest defining issues we face today as both governments and the private sector around the world tackle youth employment and other challenging workforce issues. We’re also working to leverage the Economic Graph to provide more , along with making tools available to individuals around the world to help them become more productive and successful. One example of this is a research paper released today. The paper, written by and commissioned by LinkedIn, shows connectedness, as measured by the average number of connections among LinkedIn members in various U.S. metropolitan areas, is a factor in job growth. According to Michael’s report, , “the most-connected metro regions had more than double the job growth of the least-connected metro regions.”  Michael also concludes that “improving connections could boost U.S. employment by 700,000 to as much as 1.8 million workers.” In other words, the greater the density of connections among people within a given metro area, the greater the chance for job growth and economic opportunity within that given metro area. Michael lays out a compelling case for the use of technology and data to help create economic opportunity by building upon connections. The research also suggests the promise of being able to spot, in real-time, the trends of the global economy and then, for example, adapting curricula for community colleges to meet the demands of local companies in need of skilled labor.

If you’re a first-time SlideShare user or simply wondering how to make the most of it, here are three quick tips: Ever hear that old saying, “A picture is worth a thousand words”? That’s especially true with presentations, where images have impact. Go for beautiful imagery and just enough wording to make your point. Ask yourself - or better yet, a friend or colleague you trust to be honest - if the images you’re including make sense and illustrate your points well. Tailor accordingly. Why should people care about your topic? What do you want them to walk away with? How timely, relevant, and helpful is it? Who are you trying to speak to? The more clearly you can articulate these answers to yourself - before you create a presentation or infographic - the stronger your content will be.

In this latest series on LinkedIn, “The Road Not Taken,” we asked some of the world’s most successful professionals to explain how their career paths might have turned out differently. From Suze Orman and Deepak Chopra to the World Bank's Jim Kim and General Electric's Beth Comstock, more than 60 Influencers chimed in with inspiring tales and reflections of what might've been.

In an amazing display of generosity, Orman's loyal customers rallied behind her: \"When [Fred, a beloved customer] finished his breakfast, he didn’t just leave a tip. He gave me a $2,000 check and commitments from other diners/friends that totaled $50,000 (the equivalent of nearly $150,000 today) along with a note: My own Kickstarter campaign, circa 1979!\" In fact, Orman might have become a restaurateur if not for a critical turn of events — she lost the $50,000 in a bad investment. The setback, Orman writes, helped launch \"a new career passion: helping people take control of their financial lives.\"   As a teenager, worked at an ice cream parlor. One day, his boss ordered him to scrape gum off the floor. \"That’s not my job,\" I said. \"My job’s to scoop ice cream.\" Next thing out of my boss's mouth was: \"You’re fired.

Though loved to sing, she abandoned her love of singing for more \"professional\" endeavors at Facebook. \"I learned quickly that in the corporate world, it’s 'distracting' for women to have side interests, aside from work and family – and that if I wanted to be taken seriously in my career, I would need to shelve my passion for performing,\" Zuckerberg writes.

Her boss, Jeff Immelt, said: \"'I need you to be more confident.'\"... I remember thinking, 'He has found me out.'\"   describes getting fired from CBS as an “out-of-body experience. I sent my work to other networks and the response was… crickets. I went from everything to everyone to nothing to no one.” As her severance pay and job prospects dwindled, Brzezinski reluctantly broadened her job search: \"I'll never forget the moment.

Last year that changed when a job was recommended to me on LinkedIn based on a mix of my technical skills and love of fashion – and I got it. Here’s how: I grew up in Andover. I loved my time there, it’s a place where everyone knows each other and you’re never far from a friendly face. My favourite weekends were when my friends and I would bundle on the train to London early on a Saturday morning to spend a day in the city. It was always amazing to visit so many incredible shops. I used to pick up all kinds of things and fashion them into my own creations to wear. Eventually I started making things others wanted to buy too. As much as I loved fashion, I saw it as my personal passion. When it came to choosing a career I wanted to follow what I was really good at – IT. I guess I picked up a lot of that from my brother. He gave me my first computer, taught me how to make basic websites and what HTML was. IT quickly became my favourite subject at school. Unfortunately, during my last A-level exam, panic set in. I fell just shy of a required grade to get into the Computer Science course. The university suggested I study physics instead as I had the grades and could still learn a lot of the same skills. After graduation, I looked to London at all the big companies, but without the Computer Science title, it seemed out of reach. After multiple rejections I started to lose hope. I turned to local companies and managed to find one willing to give me a chance and train me. I became a QA Engineer – I ensure high quality in software before it’s released to customers. Basically, I use my technical skills to look under the hood and suggest improvements. Over time, a lot of my friends from university started to move away and I felt like I needed to do something new I decided to update my LinkedIn profile with the new skills I’d gained. I also started to follow a lot of companies I really loved on LinkedIn - including ASOS, a fashion company. One day, I got a job recommendation through the site – it was for the same role I had as a QA Engineer but at ASOS. LinkedIn saw my skills and the companies I loved and made the connection. I never thought that ASOS would have an in-house technology department; I thought ASOS just dealt with the fashion side. It was my big chance to finally move to London and have this amazing experience of doing what I was good at, but in an industry that meant so much to me. I never thought it would happen, but it did. On my first day, I got to watch the models walking down the catwalk, saw clothes being designed, images being edited and of course the website being developed. I was surprised by how laid back and quirky the office was despite being quite a large company. They even let me walk down the catwalk for fun – it’s hard! I’m so grateful that I was given this opportunity. It just goes to show that you only have to put yourself out there and give people the chance to find you to end up exactly where you want to be.

Even Indian executives, who retained the highest level of optimism and who are optimistic about the Indian economy, declined in their optimism about the global economy by 10 percentage points to 61%. This quarter we added a new question on education. Specifically, we asked executives whether they felt confident that their country's educational system is preparing students for successful careers. Only Switzerland showed high confidence levels in the educational system with 73% of respondents saying that they are confident in the country's educational system, with the majority of other countries expressing low levels of confidence in their country's educational system. Read on for the full results of the Q3 LinkedIn Economic Confidence Outlook survey of more than 13,000 senior business leaders on LinkedIn, including global optimism, optimism by country, and hiring expectations by country. Based on the executives’ answers, countries like Switzerland, the Netherlands, India, Canada, Germany and Belgium seem to be doing the best job preparing students. Countries like Brazil, Japan, Spain and Italy appear to lag behind in the eyes of executives in those countries. Executives in almost all of the major economies around the globe are feeling less optimistic about the global economy getting better than they did a quarter ago. This retreat in sentiment could signal a change in how these executives approach their business decisions in the near term. The post-election business euphoria has yet to wear off among business executives working in India. Based on their responses, they remain bullish on the near term economic outlook for India’s economy. India is among the few countries bucking the negative trend shown in other countries.

Readers are 14 times more likely to click on blogs that include a compelling image. Cut visual clutter and pick one that has one strong, central focal point. Go for crisp colors or dramatic black and white - and make sure the image ties in with the themes in your blog. After the cover photo, a is the next step in grabbing a reader’s attention. Help LinkedIn members find, like, share and comment on your insights by firing up your piece with a catchy, interesting title that aligns with your subject matter.

Professionals are no longer solely focused on getting the big raise or promotion; increasingly, they're searching for those small victories at work -- like getting a compliment from a boss, a colleague or client (38%) -- that can lead to a greater sense of fulfillment. When I think back to some of the most memorable moments in my career, a few milestones come to mind, the release of my first book or when I launched my own business. However, when I think about my most poignant accomplishments, it’s actually the small wins like hearing that my first client landed her dream job or getting the keys to my first office space, that made me feel the most fulfilled and proud. At LinkedIn, we’re committed to helping our members achieve all types of success and have been sharing some of the we’ve heard. We’ve also discovered key insights about professionals and what they really care about when it comes to being successful at their jobs. Here’s more on what we found… LinkedIn found that when managers express gratitude or praise for everyday contributions, it goes far beyond the individual and can have a widespread effect on a company. U.S. adults are more likely to have a better attitude (58%), do a better job (45%) and stay at the company longer (32%) when these small wins are recognized. Take who co-founded a dog-food company focused on whole foods; his contributions are being felt beyond the confines of an office, and within the homes of dog owners across the country. His motivation? The opportunity to share his ideas with the rest of the world. More than one in five professionals in the U.S. would rather have a job where their everyday contributions are recognized than one where they receive an extra vacation day. But recognition does not only have to come from a manager or boss. We and found that many professionals cite the most gratifying type of recognition is seeing the impact their accomplishments have on loved ones. Everyone’s career path is different, as are the experiences that bring us happiness and pride along the way. For landing a job after her yearlong hunt was not enough. It was the moment she sat at her new desk and saw her name and title front-and-center on her phone that made her feel she made it! This experience propelled Jenni’s confidence and overall passion, so much so that she is now the founder of her own marketing company. Or take , a LinkedIn member who invested 13 years in a career as an architect before going back to school to explore his true passion: robot and spaceship design. “Had I not had such a long journey, I would not be where I am today,” Gurmukh shares. LinkedIn is celebrating all types of success – both big and small – and we want to hear your stories.

I highly encourage you to review , including our GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation. [1] I will co-host a with our CEO to discuss our financial results for the third quarter 2014 and business outlook today at 2:00PM Pacific Time. The full transcript of the webcast/conference call can be downloaded from our . See slides below. This post contains non-GAAP financials measures relating to the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures at and additional details regarding the use of non-GAAP measures below.  This presentation also contains forward-looking statements about our products, including our investments in products, technology and other key strategic areas, certain non-financial metrics, such as customer and member growth and engagement, and our expected financial metrics such as revenue, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP EPS, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and fully-diluted weighted shares for the fourth quarter of 2014 and the full fiscal year 2014. The achievement of the matters covered by such forward-looking statements involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, the company’s results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements the company makes. The risks and uncertainties referred to above include - but are not limited to - risks associated with: our limited operating history in a new and unproven market; engagement of our members; the price volatility of our Class A common stock; general economic conditions; expectations regarding the return on our strategic investments; execution of our plans and strategies, including with respect to mobile products and features; security measures and the risk that they may not be sufficient to secure our member data adequately or that we are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of members to access our solutions; expectations regarding our ability to timely and effectively scale and adapt existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that our solutions are accessible at all times with short or no perceptible load times; our ability to maintain our rate of revenue growth and manage our expenses and investment plans; our ability to accurately track our key metrics internally; members and customers curtailing or ceasing to use our solutions; our core value of putting members first, which may conflict with the short-term interests of the business; privacy and changes in regulations, which could impact our ability to serve our members or curtail our monetization efforts; litigation and regulatory issues; increasing competition; our ability to manage our growth; our international operations; our ability to recruit and retain our employees; the application of U.S. and international tax laws on our tax structure and any changes to such tax laws; acquisitions we have made or may make in the future; and the dual class structure of our common stock. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company’s financial results is included in filings it makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and additional information will also be set forth in our Form 10-Q that will be filed for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, which should be read in conjunction with these financial results. These documents are or will be available on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Relations page of the company's website at http://investors.linkedin.com/. All information provided in this post is as of October 30, 2014, and LinkedIn undertakes no duty to update this information. To supplement its condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to peer operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Income tax effects and adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by considering the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, the company has implemented a non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect our long-term operations. Historically, the company computed a non-GAAP tax rate based on non-GAAP pre-tax income on a quarterly basis. Based on our current forecast, a non-GAAP tax rate of 35% has been applied to our non-GAAP financial results for the current period. The company believes that adjusting for these income tax effects and adjustments provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from non-GAAP net income. Dilutive shares under the treasury stock method. During periods with a net loss, the company excluded certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP EPS guidance to net income (loss) or GAAP EPS guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or GAAP provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. As items that impact net income (loss) are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net income (loss) is not available without unreasonable effort."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Speaker Series"],"author":"Liz Li","title":"Creating Opportunity for All: LinkedIn Speaker Series with Kiva’s Premal Shah and Julie Hanna","date":"November 3, 2014","content":"Last week, I had the chance to attend an inspiring LinkedIn Speaker Series discussion with LinkedIn co-founder, , the President of , , and Kiva’s Executive Chair of the Board, . Premal and Julie shared how their respective backgrounds led to their involvement with Kiva – Premal through his visits to India and seeing the stark poverty there, and Julie through her experience as a survivor of the Black September war in Jordan. In both cases, their experiences drove them to pursue a more just world through making opportunity available to all, scaled with technology and enabled by everyday people. Kiva embodies those goals through its mission to connect people through lending to alleviate poverty. Kiva and their partners allow anyone to lend money to borrowers who don’t have access to traditional bank loans. The loans enable borrowers to create better lives for themselves and their families, and are repaid over time. Our belief is that the role of nonprofits is to start where the markets end, where the markets fail - Premal Shah. I was struck by how true Premal’s comment was, that nonprofits can have the largest impact where markets have failed or aren’t willing to bear the risk. Those gaps are where human compassion comes into play, and ordinary people will help those whom no one else is willing to help. Premal shared a very timely story of how the current Ebola crisis in West Africa has halted all local Kiva partner activity, meaning loans aren’t getting repaid. This might cause chaos for commercial lenders, but the compassion of individual Kiva lenders means they’re willing to adjust repayment schedules. To address gaps like these, Kiva continues to push on making opportunity available for everyone. Their latest program, Kiva Zip, takes the microfinance model one step further by directly lending to borrowers without the need for a partner organization. Hearing Premal and Julie speak, I am inspired. We often think that as one individual, we can’t do much, but technology and organizations like Kiva allow me to see the stories of real people across the world, feel a connection, and make a life-changing contribution. Altogether, over one million individual Kiva lenders have made over $600 million in loans. Imagine if every LinkedIn member contributed $25! Here’s how you can get started: After the talk, I went home and used my repaid Kiva loans to make a new loan on Kiva Zip, and donated on Watsi, an organization Premal mentioned that allows people to fund healthcare for those in need. For only $75, I helped fund a business in Kenya and a child’s surgery in Tanzania. Whose life can you change?

This is how she is able to make a difference — by sharing her story and the story of others to inspire change.  She encouraged all of us to make our voices heard to change the world. Her stories of working on issues close to her heart and the hearts of the people she serves is a true beacon and reason for optimism in the United States. Senator Gillibrand said that “raw emotion, raw urgency, and empathy are what’s missing in Washington today,” and we at LinkedIn had the privilege of seeing all of those qualities shine through in her. Since becoming a Senator in 2009 after then Senator Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State, Senator Gillibrand helped lead the successful charge to repeal “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” after hearing the heart-breaking impact that law had on so many Veterans. She co-sponsored legislation with a Republican lawmaker in order to gain bipartisan support for health care coverage for rescue workers who fell ill after helping at the 9/11 crash sites, and is working across the aisle to end sexual assault in the military and on college campuses.  She is truly a powerful force in Washington. But her message resonated with me in a different way than other “speak up and be a leader” messages have in the past. For starters, I can relate to Senator Gillibrand as a woman “doing it all” (note: she believes in using the phrase “doing it all” instead of the now-common “having it all”). She’s a mom trying to balance work, marriage, and a calling to serve others. And she is surprisingly normal. I have sat on the bleachers watching baseball games and volunteered at my kids’ schools with parents just like her. She isn’t perfect and doesn’t try to be; she’s completely genuine and speaks honestly to her fears and challenges. She is keenly aware that not everyone “likes” her, and while many people will judge her, and she just had to get comfortable with that in order to put herself out there to advocate for others. Senator Gillibrand is one of the country’s most powerful leaders, and hearing her speak was a remarkable experience because she was so humble and normal. I can see myself in her. I can also raise my voice and change the world.  So can you."},{"post_categories":["Economic Graph"],"author":"Sohan Murthy","title":"Defining A City By Its Professional Skill Set with Data From LinkedIn","date":"October 22, 2014","content":"By their very design and origins, cities have always been linked closely to opportunity.

But every once in awhile I would get to name something and I would realize that that’s what I really loved to do. When I discovered in 2003 that naming brands was a bonafide profession, I didn’t want to be a copywriter any more. I wanted to be a professional namer. Easier said than done. Contrary to popular belief, advertising and branding rarely intersect. Branding (creating the name, tagline, identity design, and packaging) is something that is done in the very beginning of product development. Advertising comes much later, and the campaigns are created by ad agencies– not branding firms. So while I was well networked among ad agencies, I didn’t have any contacts in branding. How do you stake your claim as a naming genius when your own name isn’t widely known? In truth, LinkedIn was not my first thought. In fact, at that time, I thought LinkedIn was a place that people with full time jobs used to look for new full time jobs. I’m glad a client told me otherwise. LinkedIn turned out to be the most important tool for getting my name out there. Building out my personal profile and kicking my networking into high gear helped me connect with some key industry players, which led to me snagging a lot of naming jobs. Now I was hooked. I started to spend more time on LinkedIn, learning how to use all of the tools available to me. Before I knew it, my network was growing and so was word of mouth about my business. LinkedIn not only helped me get started, but it was also critical to helping me get my business off the ground, attracting new customers, and building my reputation as a creative namer. Here’s how I made LinkedIn a part of my journey into a new industry: Write your profile in the first person the way you would talk about yourself at a networking event: You want to sound approachable, not stiff and corporate. Writing in the first-person voice makes your profile sound like someone your future connections (and clients) would like to meet in person. For part of my description of my old freelance copywriting work, I wrote, “I rode the dot com gravy train until it crashed in my backyard.” If you’re having trouble describing who you are and what you do, record yourself talking about your business to a friend, and transcribe that conversation. Max out the space that LinkedIn gives you to tell your story. Your profile is your best opportunity to get people interested in you what you have to offer – so why not go long on descriptions? My profile summary has a long list of all of the brand and product names my company has developed recently – it’s the perfect place to show off my work. When you meet someone at a business mixer or a conference, you usually try to find some common ground to kick off the conversation. Do the same thing when you send InMails to people you want to connect with: Include something that you read in the person’s profile like an interest or college you share. I usually say something like, “I see we’ve got several connections in common, and I’d love to have you in my rock-star network too.” Who could say no to that? Your profile shouldn’t be a dry recitation of past jobs – spice it up with the things that make you a great person to work with. In my case, I added, “Paid to eat Ghirardelli chocolate and write about it” under the Honors & Awards section of her profile. That’s gotten a lot of attention. Fast-forward to today - I still use LinkedIn every day to keep my network strong and to share ideas with other people in the business.

I worked a number of odd jobs to gain valuable skills, and while that experience was important, it wasn’t everything. Developing soft skills was just as important to grow my career. But which soft skills are employers looking for in young professionals today? This question continues to cause young professionals a great deal of angst. As a researcher at LinkedIn, I wanted to find the answer in order to help young people get hired.  So, my team asked over 1,400 hiring managers from Fortune 500 companies in the US to rank which skills and personality traits they consider to be the most important when hiring young professionals (with 0-3 years of experience). It turns out, exhibiting specific skills and personality traits may get you further along in the hiring process. Here’s the breakdown: The most important skills hiring managers look for in young hires are problem-solving (finding solutions when faced with challenges) and being a good learner (learning new skills quickly). Survey results show that hiring managers look for young professionals that are collaborative, work hard and have a positive attitude. These personality traits are considered more important than being passionate, organized, resilient or even a leader. It’s not say that the latter aren’t important to have and share in an interview; they’re just less important than working well with others, having a strong work ethic and great attitude. But that’s not the entire story. Depending on the role, hiring managers may prioritize other skills and personality traits. Specifically, we found that when interviewing/hiring for a….

But what if we could ask the world's brightest minds in business how they would fix the broken things we all know should — and can — be?

It tells people who you are, what you’re passionate about, and what your goals are for your next chapter. With our network of more than 300+ million professionals at your fingertips, you have the potential for exposure to a massive audience. But how can you make sure the right people are engaging with your profile? What steps should you take to put your best professional foot forward to gain more visibility? Today, we’re launching a new addition to the Who's Viewed Your Profile feature: an additional component to the existing insights graph so that, in addition to seeing who is looking at your profile, you can see which actions you took that led to that specific increase in engagement, including making various updates to your profile, endorsing a connection, joining a group or expanding your network. We know that taking simple actions on LinkedIn is important for profile views. But which action led to an increase in views by the type of people you want to get in front of? Layering who is looking at your profile over the actions you have taken lets you focus on the actions that are most relevant to your professional goals, maximizing the engagement your profile receives. In turn, this increased engagement can lead to more opportunities for you. So, for example, if you are trying to attract new clients or business leads, you can see how many potential partners looked at your profile after you joined an important industry group. Or, if you’re looking for a new job, you can look at your insights graph to see whether adding a skill to your profile or endorsing a peer gave you a bigger bump in views by recruiters. No matter your goal, you’ll be able to see which actions lead to the most relevant profile views - then start reaching out and closing the sale or applying for your dream job. And since your professional brand needs to be maintained in this always-on world, we have also added Who’s Viewed Your Profile to our mobile app. Now you can keep up with who is engaging with your profile - and why - from anywhere.

To that end, students and parents want to know which schools give them the best chance at getting a desirable job after graduation. This is where we can help. By analyzing employment patterns of over 300 million LinkedIn members from around the world, we figured out what the desirable jobs are within several professions and which graduates get those desirable jobs. As a result, we are able to rank schools based on the career outcomes of their graduates. We define a desirable job to be a job at a desirable company for the relevant profession. For example, we define as f . We start with identifying desirable companies for each profession.We let the career choices of our members tell us how desirable it is to work at a company. To illustrate this, there are two companies, A and B. If more finance professionals are choosing to leave company A to work at company B, the data indicates that getting a finance job at B is more desirable. This is based on the hypothesis that when a professional moves from one company to she gives the company she moves to a strong vote of confidence. Similarly, the ability of a company to retain its employees is a strong indicator of that employer’s attractiveness. So, hypothetically, if A and B are both attracting external employees at similar rates, but A has a much larger employee turnover than B, the data would show B to be a more desirable employer. In other words, the most desirable companies in a profession are those that are the best at attracting and retaining talent in that profession. Since not every graduate is interested in the same profession, it is only fair to define the relevant graduates as those who end up working in that career. For example, while ranking a school for the category 'Investment Bankers', we only consider graduates from that school who work as investment bankers. In addition, we want university rankings to reflect recent employment trends. Therefore, we only consider graduates who obtained their degrees within the past eight years. We now have both pieces of the puzzle: the graduates who are relevant to a particular profession, and the desirable jobs for that profession. For each university and profession, we then calculate the percentage of relevant graduates who have obtained desirable jobs. These percentages allow us to rank universities based on career outcomes across different professional areas. As the professional world evolves, we are continually looking to provide university rankings for an increasingly broad spectrum of career paths. Stay tuned!

Fast-forward four years: My daughter and many of her friends have graduated from universities across the country.  A few have landed great jobs, but most are wondering what to do next, and which choices will lead them closer to the futures they dream about. My daughter and her friends are not alone. If you’ve followed the news lately, you’ve heard about the great challenges in education and youth unemployment. The media is full of stories about abysmal college graduation rates, astronomical student loan debt, the difficulty graduates have paying back student loans, and the “skills gap” between the jobs employers have right now, and the skills of today’s graduates. So whether deciding where to attend college, or figuring out how to launch their careers after graduation, students and graduates today face difficult decisions with few reliable resources to help them navigate this rapidly changing environment. Today, LinkedIn is introducing new tools designed to help students overcome many of these obstacles. These tools combine data-driven insights based on the career paths of LinkedIn members, and social features so students can get guidance from trusted advisors and professionals who have walked in their shoes. Taken together, they offer a new way for students – and people who care about them – to navigate one of life’s biggest decisions: choosing where to go to school and what to study. Finding the right fit is about matching students – each with their unique strengths and interests – to the specific environments where they will thrive. It’s a complicated process – and were designed to make it better. Using a combination of organizational, social and insight tools, students can “work the problem” from start to decision. Students can share their evolving thought process with trusted advisors, and meet future classmates for inspiration and commiseration. But where can students find the right schools and fields of study to add to their decision boards?  How can they expand their sense of what’s possible for their education and career? That’s where LinkedIn’s powerful data-driven exploration tools can help: Which schools are best at launching graduates into desirable jobs? We analyzed millions of alumni profiles to find out how universities stack up across a variety of careers. Then, we ranked schools based on how successful their recent graduates have been at landing desirable jobs as designers, software developers, investment bankers and more. These are the first rankings using alumni career outcomes to rank schools for specific careers. We are just getting started with - more categories and countries will be coming over time.

If you aren’t a prospective student now, odds are you know someone who is – maybe your child, a younger sibling, or even a colleague thinking about graduate school.  LinkedIn was built based on the belief that relationships matter for successful, satisfying lives. Over the years, we’ve heard many stories about how a person who offered the right advice at the right time changed the trajectory of someone’s life. It happened to me – a high school teacher looked at my list of colleges, told me I’d be miserable at all of them, and suggested Carnegie Mellon.  I applied at the last minute, was accepted, and loved it there – enough to go back for a master’s degree.  One conversation changed the course of my life – and set me on a fabulous career I would never have imagined. As a successful professional, you have enormous power to help the next generation succeed. Reach out and lend them a hand. Suggest universities or fields of study you think might suit them. If a student shares their Decision Board with you, take a few minutes to see what they are thinking, add your comments, and answer their questions. Invite them to connect and introduce them to people who might be able to help – maybe a colleague who attended a school they are considering. The best way to “change the world” is to help the next generation get a great start on the path to pursuing their passions.

It’s our semi-annual report that explains how many times over a six-month period law enforcement or other government officials asked us to provide information about one or more of our members. This version of the report includes a couple of small but meaningful changes. As we’ve emphasized in the past, our members are our top priority. We’re committed to being open and honest with you, especially when it comes to your data. That’s why we tweaked our Transparency Report this time around to add more clarity about the requests we receive and our efforts to protect member data. When government officials ask for member information—usually through subpoenas, search warrants or court orders (read our for more information)—we review the request to see if it’s defective, too broad, or otherwise objectionable. Since we don’t comply with every request, the number of government requests we receive can be a lot higher than the number of requests we act on. Prior versions of the Transparency Report identified the total number of member accounts that were targeted in the government requests (whether we actually provided any data or not) as “Accounts Impacted.” We don’t think an account is truly “impacted” if no data is produced, so we renamed that column “Accounts Subject to Request(s).” If any member data is provided in response to a government request (even if it’s less information than originally demanded), we consider his or her account one of the “Accounts Impacted” in a new column in this version of the Transparency Report. The “Accounts Impacted” column calculates the total number of member accounts for which we provided at least some data in response to a government request in the January through June 2014 reporting period. We plan to continue tracking that statistic going forward. Since we didn’t track it before this reporting period, it is marked as “not available” when you look at prior reporting periods. The number of government requests for member data increased just over 60% between the second half of 2013 and first half of 2014. While that’s a significant increase, it’s not as significant as the increase in the number of member accounts these requests encompassed. We saw a 150% spike in the number of accounts subject to government requests in this reporting period, compared to the total number of accounts subject to government requests (July 2011 through December 2013). We are concerned by this trend, and we will continue to object to data demands that are not narrowly focused. Our opposition to government requests that are defective, or that cover too many member accounts, is reflected in the Transparency Report for this reporting period. Of the 1,144 accounts targeted in government data requests, data was provided for 150 accounts (roughly 13%). As we reported in earlier this year, thanks to legal action that LinkedIn and other technology companies brought against the government, we are able to include some information about national security-related data requests in the Transparency Report. While we still can’t report exactly how many of those requests we receive, we can identify the range (0-249, 250-499, 500-749, etc). In this reporting period, we received between 0 and 249 national security-related requests, which addressed between 0 and 249 member accounts. We believe transparency is good for everyone—LinkedIn, its members, and the government officials working to keep us all safe. We’ll keep trying to refine the data we provide and the format in which it’s reported and hope you continue to find it informative.

It’s not.” It’s unsophisticated, yet clear. Interestingly enough, its author – Dr. Seuss – was not on a mission to save the planet. He merely wanted to empower kids to take action. But the Dr. Seuss line may be a fitting slogan for the massive social impact conferences about to kick off — , , the and more — which argues that the ideas with the biggest impact often come from small groups of people following a mission with passion. Why hope for others with more power, money, time or expertise to do something for you, when you have the ability to make your own difference in the world?  It’s an approach that has long guided some of the best-known figures in philanthropy.  When , was a few months into his first year at medical school, he felt disconnected from the problems of the real world. His friend, , had told him about his experience in Haiti and the need for quality health care, so Kim decided to travel there with him. They both witnessed how hard – and expensive – it was for the local community to treat infectious diseases like tuberculosis. They soon realized the system needed to change. With help from others, they trained community members to treat patients in their homes, rather than having to send them to hospitals abroad or wait for medication that often took too long to arrive.  Together, they founded and soon expanded operations to Peru, Siberia and other places, in large part, to fight some of the most-neglected diseases on earth. Many years have gone by since then, but Farmer has focused on getting treatment right for patients and Kim has applied those principles to help . In 2012 Barack Obama appointed Dr. Kim as president of the World Bank, and for the first time the professional experience of its leader matched its stated mission.  While individuals take action independently, organizations have been tackling broader goals by uniting the world. In 2000, by 2015; goals like eradicating extreme poverty, achieving universal primary education, gender equality and combating diseases. Two people have been instrumental in its execution: Ray Chambers, UN Special Envoy for Financing the Health MDGs and for Malaria, and Jeffrey Sachs, Director at the Earth Institute at Columbia University and special adviser to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Together they founded Millennium Promise, a non-profit that empowers communities to lift themselves out of extreme poverty. From dealing with climate change and the MDGs, to seeing the importance of technology in social impact and reviewing the trends for the future, other LinkedIn Influencers are also taking action. In his first LinkedIn post, Sachs writes: \" . …The world economy is not only remarkably unequal but also remarkably threatening to earth itself. The unprecedentedly large scale of the world economy is creating an unprecedented environmental crisis, one that threatens the lives and well-being of billions of people and the survival of millions of other species on the planet, and perhaps even our own.” Blake Mycoskie was backpacking in Argentina when he noticed that not owning a pair of shoes was preventing kids from attending school.

I’ve gone from a 16-year-old waitress to the 30-year-old business owner and brand communications manager of an incredible crowdfunding platform – and I couldn’t have done it without the amazing people from my LinkedIn network. I grew up in Cornwall, in the south of England. From an early age, I knew this was where I belonged. Despite calling my home a small seaside town in Cornwall, I developed a burning ambition to prove that no matter your location, you can still make a big impact, wherever you are. It’s been a tough journey, but I’m thankful to the people around me who made it possible. First was my Dad. School wasn’t easy: I don’t think I was the coolest kid. I just wanted to get out there and work. I remember my Dad saying, “Do what you love. You don’t have to do this if you don’t want to.” It was scary leaving formal schooling at 16, but having my dad's backing to follow my dreams meant the world. I felt I could achieve the impossible. When I left school, I applied to work as a waitress at the . I got the job and, for the first time ever, immediately felt at home. I loved it. Over the next few years, I worked my way up and into the PR and Communications team. It was my first desk job, which came with my first desk. I was so proud I actually polished it every night! But the best thing about Eden was that it was bursting with inspiring people, and I began to realize that maybe I could start achieving great things myself. My ambition to do something more, to own something, grew. When I became pregnant, I had a now-or-never moment. My partner Ben and I decided to buy two camper vans, renovate them, and rent them out – and so was born. Granted, they promptly fell apart like the rust buckets they were. The bank wouldn’t help us, and instead they suggested we just go bankrupt. It wasn’t a good start! Thankfully, I knew a lot of people who wanted to help. I started using LinkedIn to connect with all the amazing people I had met since my days at Eden. It seemed like a good time to reach out. When I look at the breadth of my connections, they’ve got years and years of experience behind them. They gave me the knowledge I needed to set up and run a successful, sustainable business – from accounting to replacing engine parts. Eventually, we got our first two campers up and running. Then the business just grew and now we have four campers on the road with another four to renovate, and even more on the way. It’s the people in my network that have helped me get to where I am today and now I want to use that experience to help others achieve their own dreams. I was offered a role as the Brand Communications Manager at , . At Crowdfunder, we’ve raised over millions for businesses, charities, social enterprises and communities since launching in 2012. It’s brilliant to work for a company that gives me a real opportunity to help others get the funding I struggled to find when I created and launched The Cornwall Camper Company. My advice? It’s to get out there, meet people, and build relationships. Make lasting impressions and connections that will lead to future opportunities. That’s where LinkedIn can help. -- Jess Ratty  @_Jessification_"},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Nicole Williams","title":"Six Easy Ways to Tap into Your Network on the Go","date":"September 24, 2014","content":"\"I’d like to, but I don’t have enough time.” That’s the excuse I typically hear from people who don’t network.

Then, as we start out on our careers, something curious happens. When we are achieving some of our biggest professional accomplishments, be that securing a big deal or completing an important project, the volume of that parental acknowledgment seems to reduce. Not because our parents stop caring, but because distance, lack of understanding, and an ever-changing world of work means they have fewer reference points to help them share our everyday successes. We launched (BIYP) last year to help bridge this generational gap when it comes to the world of work. More than 30 businesses all over the world opened the doors to their employees’ parents, and over 15,000 professionals showed their parents exactly what they did at work. The experience was incredibly rewarding. Take it from someone who knows. My mum came into our London office last year – English isn’t her first language and getting her to understand the complex world of modern day public relations, let alone the minefield that is social media, was a big ask. None of that seemed to matter though. Soon after BIYP Day last year, I overheard my mum recalling (showing off?) to our family in Pakistan. I was somewhat touched to hear her say, amongst other things, how she always knew she was proud – and now she knew why. To celebrate the launch of this year’s BIYP, we conducted global research to uncover the extent and nature of this untapped source of advice – our parents. There was one data point that stuck out for me: , whilst parents might be under valuing themselves with a third (35%) feeling the same. Whilst my mum can’t help me write a press release, I have no doubt that the razor sharp negotiation skills (for example) I inherited from her have played a huge part in my everyday productivity and professional success. from LinkedIn’s Bring In Your Parents Day will be happening again on November 6 2014.

She used the only business experience she had to create a lemonade stand to raise money in the fight against child slavery. In just 173 days, she raised $100,000, but she wasn’t satisfied just reaching her goal. She decided since child slavery wasn’t done, she wasn’t done.

Security starts at login, so our systems proactively evaluate member login attempts for suspicious activity and to detect for potential intrusions. Many of these takeover attempts use automated tools to guess passwords, which our systems work to detect and then deploy roadblocks against. We also monitor key site metrics 24x7 looking for and mitigating attacks against our login system. We’ve also moved the majority of our member traffic to which provides authentication of our site and protects against man-in-the-middle attacks. We also compare username and password combinations we find on the Internet to our member’s credentials, and in the event we find matches, we promptly invalidate the password for the account and then notify the member to update their password. Most account takeover attempts leverage these large sets of emails and passwords, though in some cases, hackers spend time researching specific targets and working to obtain account identifiers such as email addresses. To mitigate these types of attacks, we deploy automated defenses to prevent abuse of functionality that members use to connect such as address book import. We are building an opt out setting where members can choose to not have their email address discoverable to people they are not connected with through address book import.

LinkedIn is more than just a place where you find opportunities; it’s a place where opportunities find you. For that to happen you have to put yourself out there (completing your LinkedIn Profile, sharing content, engaging with your network, etc.), and make sure you’re . Including endorsements and recommendations in your Profile is a great way to complement and confirm the skills and experiences you’ve listed while also catching the eye of potentially interested professional parties. Earlier this year, we made endorsements easier to manage by allowing you to highlight the skills and strengths you’re proudest of, and now, we’ve done the same for recommendations. Beginning today we’ll begin rolling out a refreshed recommendations designed to make it easier to manage your recommendations and recommendations requests. You can also now reorder your recommendations – moving your best recommendations to the top of the stack for each experience. So what are the real differences between recommendations and endorsements?  Imagine for a moment that you and a colleague are deciding which employee will be be best to tackle a new project that requires strong project management skills. Your colleague mentions they’re considering Tom so you jump in: “Tom would be perfect, I’ve been impressed with the strategic thinking and change management skills he exhibits.” Your vote of confidence likely just provided the confirmation they were looking for. A LinkedIn endorsement is similar-- you are confirming your colleague’s talents when it come to a specific skill or trait. These votes of confidence add up and send a strong signal about your abilities to accomplish specific tasks. You can vouch for a skill listed on a connection’s profile with a simple click of a button, or, if you feel they are missing a skill, suggest they add a new one (rest assured, you have a choice of whether or not to add that new skill to your profile if someone suggests one). The right endorsements can go a long way in helping you establish your professional brand -- and not all endorsements are created equal. For example, a Project Management endorsement from an existing colleague is more valuable to a recruiter than a similar endorsement from a high-school friend might be. It is therefore in your best interest to add the most appropriate skills to your profile and select the most relevant and credible . It is also advisable to keep this in mind when endorsing your connections. Ask yourself, what will really help them the most?  Writing a recommendation lets you drill down into the how and why of your experience working with someone. The golden rule of powerful recommendations is “Show, don’t tell”. Wouldn’t it be more telling to read how Allison built and motivated her team to achieve stellar results instead of reading that “Allison is a great manager”? Always remember that the most compelling recommendations tell a story rather than provide empty statements. A well-done recommendation should describe and give specific examples, whether they reflect someone’s ability to excel under pressure, act as a compassionate leader, succeed as a collaborative team-member or business partner. For recruiters, future hires or potential business partners, such a recommendation provides an important sign that this connection could be the person they are looking for. If you’re the one looking to receive recommendations, always begin by identifying the people who know you well and who can best speak to your aptitude for excelling in a particular professional domain, attest to your leadership or management skills or shed light on some of your best accomplishments.  Together, endorsements and recommendations give a better idea of what you’re like to work with, where your true skills and passions are and what some of your strongest soft skills just might be. They also make it easier for opportunities to find you. When all else is equal, they could be the difference between a recruiter reaching out to you over another candidate, a potential employee taking the job on your team versus someone else’s, a potential partner looking for an expert opinion sending you an InMail or not, and on and on. Don’t be shy to reach out and for a recommendation.

While I was proud and honored to receive the appointment, I was also anxious about the road that lay ahead. I had inherited an IT department with a demoralized workforce and dismal customer satisfaction numbers. Employee satisfaction was at a near company-wide low of 28% and the team wasn't very optimistic about the future. At the same time, internal customer satisfaction for services provided by the IT department were a paltry 24%. With a tired team and a disengaged customer base, it had become difficult to get anything done. Large initiatives stalled and existing systems showed signs of instability. I had been given the daunting task of turning a department around. Within 18 months, the same department looked completely different. Employee satisfaction was over 90% and customer satisfaction was creeping up steadily to the same level. Almost unbelievably, key projects were now moving forward. The department had completely transformed into a success story. The magic formula for this turnaround? Employee engagement. As the CIO, I focused on three simple areas: All of this helped me to realize one thing: It's easy to get people engaged if you treat them the right way. It’s also easy to learn from the mistakes and successes of others if you are willing to network and listen. My LinkedIn network served as a valuable source of advice and counsel to me, either directly through advice from colleagues, or indirectly through insightful posts by other LinkedIn members and Influencers. I reached out to LinkedIn members who had successfully navigated career transitions and met a few for lunch to learn from them directly. One such person, Executive Coach gave me superb advice as I planned my next steps. Ultimately, I left my C-level position to pursue another dream: To become an entrepreneur, start a company and build it from the ground up. Naturally, my new company focused on employee engagement and workplace culture improvement. Again my LinkedIn network proved to be a valuable resource. It helped me generate awareness of the venture and ultimately some customer inquiries. When I updated my LinkedIn Profile with my career change, it generated interest from my network, including an email from a colleague whose company then became one of my first clients. It also provided me with a platform to . The process of writing helped me rebrand myself as I worked to establish my business. It also became a tremendous source of pride, particularly when I received messages of support and encouragement from readers. Again, one of the readers of my posts became a Right Workplace client. Their company, wanted to invest in a simple leadership development program for their young leadership team. It was a perfect fit. With Right Workplace, I had now built my client base up to ten companies with a focus and commitment to improving their company culture.

Time to make friends with new roommates, figure out what textbooks to buy, and get the scoop on where all the hot parties are (among other related things that PR won’t let me talk about). If your college experience was like mine, one question will come up more often than others when you’re back at school: Or, more worryingly, , but is an internship right for you? It’s a reasonable question - whether internships lead directly to full-time opportunities at the same company, particularly through the lens of specific fields of study. Given how difficult it's been for recent grads to get full-time jobs in this economy, we wanted to provide some insights into the trends around internships by mining the data in over 300 million LinkedIn member profiles to answer two questions: Below, you can see the results of our analysis. The x-axis represents the likelihood that an internship will lead to a full-time job at the same company, and the y-axis represents the availability of internship opportunities. What does this all mean? Well, it appears that some industries have a of internship opportunities, while others have barely any at all. For example, 61 out of every 1,000 hires made in the Public Relations/Communications industry are interns. Compare that to the Education Management industry, where only 5 of every 1,000 hires are interns. Additionally, some industries are much more likely than others to offer full-time jobs to their interns. Compare that to companies in the Mining and Metals industry, where only 21% of interns take a full-time job at the same company a year later. Getting an internship anywhere can be a valuable experience. According to , . Beyond the obvious benefits of getting your foot in the door and learning relevant skills, it’s a crucial opportunity to grow your professional network on LinkedIn by connecting with your managers and colleagues. Lets dig a little deeper into the data to see how every industry stacks up: If you’ve got your eye on a specific company you’d like to work for in the future, and they’re in one of these industries, landing an internship may be the best path forward. These industries are likely to offer experiences that are applicable at many companies. Having internship experience may still be valuable when it’s time to apply for a full-time job, even if it’s not at the company you interned in. These industries tend to be really competitive, and hiring managers are likely to rely on a pipeline of top-notch interns to fill full-time jobs. If you manage to get an internship in one of these industries, hang on to it for dear life! Given how few opportunities are available, these industries probably don’t rely on internships as a source of full-time hires. Don’t sweat it if you didn’t get one, as few do. However, if you’re still looking to get your foot in the door, you’ll need to brush up on those networking skills. If you don’t know what industry to work in, consider using our chart as a guide. If you’re simply looking for internship experience, consider an industry in the top half of our chart. If you’re more interested in full-time opportunities in the future, consider an industry in the right half of our chart.

I’m sitting in front of my laptop, searching “best places to intern” in an effort to kick start my internship hunt. I see the same tech companies appear in every list across the web and proceed to read all about how great the engineering interns have it. At that moment, I started to wonder if I should’ve taken that introductory computer programming class in the fall. Did I miss my chance to work in tech? Fast forward to today. I’ve just finished my internship with LinkedIn, and I haven’t taken that computer programming class!  This marks my second time doing “non-tech” work at a tech company, after spending last summer in corporate marketing at Akamai Technologies and having just spent this summer in LinkedIn’s Global Sales Organization (GSO) program. College students who aren’t developers or programmers often make the mistake of overlooking technology companies in their job search, and I was no exception. To my fellow underclassmen, don’t fall into that trap. There are amazing opportunities at the tech companies you want to work for with positions in departments such as marketing, sales, and business development. The technology industry is exciting, fast-paced, and innovative – the perfect place for an ambitious college student with an open mind. By working on the business side, you’ll have the chance to communicate your passion and excitement for some of the most sought-after products and services today. Yes, some of the companies you want to apply to might only actively seek technical talent, but that doesn’t mean you can’t try.  Shoot their HR team an email, connect with a recruiter on LinkedIn, or walk up to their booth at your school's career fair – you never know who has an unlisted opening or might be willing to create a brand new role. Non-coders out there, I guarantee there’s an opportunity waiting for you.

My approach to design is always focused on aspiration. As a child, I grew up with practically nothing so I understand what it’s like to feel that your dreams are out of reach. I want the LinkedIn experience to make our members feel that they are taking a step closer to their goals and aspirations. When they are building something like their LinkedIn profile, I want people to feel proud of what they’ve created and empowered to make their dreams a reality. From a larger team perspective, we have a very unique approach to team structure. Our web developers, researchers, voice team and designers all work together as one team, which enables a more seamless creation process. By ensuring that everybody is measured by the same core goals, there is less debate, and more efficiency. A. I love cars and I'm constantly looking at their designs for inspiration. Dashboards, navigation interfaces and center consoles in particular, when done well, are all about simplicity. I want LinkedIn’s designs to have that similar sense of utility and sophistication. Now, in today’s digital age, we are used to being overloaded with information at every turn so some people automatically have a negative connotation with simple. Simple, however, does not mean sparse - it means sleek, useful, clean. I want members to feel that the site gives them an experience that is substantive, high-quality, and sophisticated, but, at the core, very simple and refreshingly straightforward. I want members to be pleasantly surprised with the ease of the experience. A. Aside from the obvious answer, like mastering the tools, I think it’s really important to understand how design and customer service are two sides of the same coin. I’m inspired by books like by Theodore B. Kinni, which underscores the importance of having an acute attention to detail and creating a user-centric experience. The book shares how the creators of the Disney Cruise Line look at every single, painstaking detail - from the height of the tables to the shape of the plates to the positioning of the chairs – all to create a magical experience. We call Disneyland the happiest place on earth and it is, by design.  I think people in user experience need to concentrate on the customer experience, not just the product. A. Don’t be afraid to show your personality. LinkedIn profiles aren’t like the printed resumes of old, you can bring your professional story to life. We are giving you the opportunity to share your career aspirations, showcase your unique character and what you bring to the culture of your company. , like the publishing platform and rich media, to add color to an otherwise stagnant profile on a page. A. I’m an avid musician and music is a very important part of my world. When I’m not in the office or with my family, you can find me playing the drums in my band BCC or throwing down a mix. I listen to everything. I mean that. My iPod has 80’s, Hip Hop, EDM, Alternative, Classical, Dubstep, you name it. Currently, I’m listening to downtempo trap music like “Whoops” by 12th Planet and Mayhem - it’s simple, easy to mix, and has a LA lounge vibe to it."},{"post_categories":["Economic Graph"],"author":"Michael Conover","title":"Why You Shouldn’t Drop Out of School to Start a Company","date":"August 25, 2014","content":"The image of a young, unstoppable founder is certainly appealing -- cultivated in movies like “The Social Network” and through press-friendly initiatives like the , there’s plenty in popular culture to suggest that the essential ingredients of entrepreneurship are little more than youth and a healthy dose of determination. This narrative is appealing – after all, dropping out of college to make millions of dollars sounds like a pretty great proposition – but as we discovered, the data paint a starkly different picture. Leveraging funding data from the popular investment tracking platform , the LinkedIn Data team applied state-of-the-art machine learning technology to analyze the demographics and relationships of more than 1,200 tech entrepreneurs whose companies successfully raised a round of venture capital funding in 2013. Below are a few highlights from : First and foremost, building from a strong educational foundation is a smart bet.  The majority of these VC-backed entrepreneurs list a college education on their LinkedIn profile, with such as Stanford, MIT or Harvard. But education is not the only foundational piece. Leaders of venture-backed startups also tend  to have experience at large, highly-capitalized technology firms – with .  What’s more, these men and women tend to develop leadership experience before founding a company, with prior to their current role.

Because Silicon Valley has the reputation as a global center of innovation and is home to the headquarters of some of the world’s most prominent technology companies, it follows that aspiring tech business leaders would want to sit closest to the action. In contrast, New York City is perceived as the city of bankers and consultants. After spending most of their waking hours hunched over spreadsheets and presentation files, the last place many of my classmates want to return to is New York. My summer working at LinkedIn’s New York office has completely challenged this perception which I too shared. (that’s me in the purple shirt) What I realized from the outset is that the sheer scale of the city - from the employers and job functions to the people and cultural opportunities located in New York - provides for an almost unparalleled level of experience. I can leave the LinkedIn office in the Empire State Building and have dinner with my friends in finance and marketing and talk about everything other than the newest technology disruption or the newest ad exchange. And still, because of the power of connected technology, I can come into work the next day, fully aware of the latest developments and excited to work alongside people passionate about their industry but with similarly diverse interests. To be clear, those of us who work in New York are not just waiting for the tech news to break from the West Coast. Often, we’re the ones making the headlines. In fact, due to the professional diversity here, the city has seen the development of very strong nodes between sectors, e.g. . These kinds of connections excite me as a business student and future job seeker because it indicates the potential for a wide variety of new fields and companies.

I loved to swim, I was obsessed with learning about ocean inhabitants and my fisher price camera was a constant companion, this was all at the ripe old age of nine. When I made the connection that it was someone’s job to hold the camera for the underwater natural history shows, I had my job title and an answer to the obligatory question “What do you want to be when you grow up?” I never looked back. I had the good fortune to attend a state liberal arts college that allowed its students to design their own majors, much to the chagrin of my parents. After some negotiating and soul searching we all agreed that I should dual major in Art and Biology rather than creating an underwater photography degree. Turns out they were right as there aren’t many underwater photography jobs hiring right out of college. I’d chosen a profession where I’d have to make my own path, and have a day job along the way. It took a lot of hard work and persistence, but two years out of school I had my first feature article on diving the Marquesas Islands published in Scuba Diving magazine. This gave me the confidence to press on pursuing my dreams and following an unconventional path. Now fifteen years since college I have gained a lot of experience adjusted my path and met a lot of wonderful mentors along the way. I’ve also added to my underwater repertoire and love it! For those pursuing a career along a road less traveled, LinkedIn is an invaluable tool. You never know when an opportunity will arise, or how a connection can manifest into a mutually beneficial career prospect. I have been fortunate to have direct opportunities arise through social media such as LinkedIn. I had a mentor once tell me to never forget the 3 P’s; patience, perseverance and persistence. I can honestly say that this was one of the best pieces of advice I’ve ever taken to heart.

After a successful career in the localization industry, I started a nonprofit in Florida called to help students pursue post-secondary education through small loans that they pay back by doing community work. Two years in the making and a few hiccups along the way, we were still an all-volunteer organization without prospects of hiring staff in the foreseeable future. It was time for me to secure stable employment and to push aside my “selfish” dream of starting a mafia that would transform the world one student at a time. LinkedIn not only gave me a dynamite job as a Portuguese Customer Advocate, but also encouraged me to invest my time and talents in special causes like Iduka. The company gives employees a day each month to invest in themselves, their community or the world. I even have a flexible schedule so I can continue my nonprofit work on Thursdays and Fridays. In 2013, I championed my nonprofit for a to develop a crowdfunding platform exclusively dedicated to microfinancing post-secondary education.

And while I couldn’t articulate my passion for the aesthetic component of exterior spaces at a young age, I knew there was more to landscape architecture than what I was exposed to in my immediate, small town surroundings. I envisioned people connecting with their own environment in unconventional ways. From pruning my family’s tomato plants into topiaries and forcing them to see more than just a vegetable garden, to working on an apple farm and planting trees in perfectly straight lines for a quarter mile, I dreamed of spectacular green spaces. I was passionate and curious about the aesthetics of my surroundings. I wanted people to connect with their environment in surprising ways. I continued to explore how exterior space could connect communities at every turn. I convinced fellow students to come together, sponsor and construct two adventure playgrounds. I was inspired to use more natural, less formal, unexpected materials; create a space that allowed the kids to play in unique ways; and bring families together. I wanted the playgrounds to be different than the others in town. When I left my small hometown to attend Cornell University, I further propelled my dreams of designing creative outdoor spaces that people wanted to be in. After being reprimanded and praised for my willingness to break the rules and look beyond the boundaries of my studio assignments, I realized my designs celebrated the relationship between people and the landscape... And I designed spaces that created a sense of community. I wanted to think about exterior spaces in unconventional ways, and that has served me throughout my career. After years of urban planning and designing, I now lead a studio of talented and committed architects and designers on a diverse collection of projects in my own firm. Our desire to celebrate how people use their space fuels our designs. From large mixed-use, urban infill, multi-family downtown loft conversions, to commercial and retail spaces as well as residential gardens, we celebrate how outdoor spaces bring people together. Thanks to LinkedIn, I can continue look beyond my immediate surroundings. I use LinkedIn to further my passion for building communities and reach beyond my current network.

It’s no longer just about finding the next “job.”  Today’s professionals are thinking about their professional lives as continuously evolving careers, and the way they navigate to and through new opportunities in those careers, has changed dramatically. In today’s world, the best opportunities come to you, often times when you’re not even looking for them. We’ve designed the LinkedIn Profile to help you attract these opportunities – whether it be a position on a non-profit board, an invitation to speak at an industry conference or even the opportunity to mentor a future professional.  Having the ability to highlight everything from what you’ve accomplished to what you aspire to do, beyond your 9-5 role – is critical to making sure the right people can find you. Eighty-percent of opportunities are going to those who were discovered when they weren’t actively looking. So the number one thing I’d like members to know is that you’re limiting your prospects and doing yourself a disservice by only updating your profile when you’re hunting for a job.  Instead, try treating it like an always-on advertisement for your professional self, and let it do the work for you. We hear some pretty inspirational stories from members across the world every day.  From the who used LinkedIn to help him change careers 28 years in, to the newscaster that used LinkedIn to find her children’s Mandarin tutor, they are diverse and inspiring.  But there’s one story that always stands out in my mind - a friend had lost his job and was pretty down about it. It wasn’t just emotionally challenging, there was also significant financial stress associated with the event as well, and it took a toll on him and his family. Naturally, I suggested taking advantage of LinkedIn, and - to his credit - he really went for it. When I got the call from him informing me that he had ended up landing a job via LinkedIn far better than the one he had left, I was pretty moved. This story showed me, first hand, the power we have to make a really big difference in people’s lives.  These stories, inspire all of us at LinkedIn to do everything we can to ensure our members have the tools they need to help them grow and transform in their careers. There’s a great book called the ‘Medici Effect’ that really influenced my thinking on this topic. There’s a misperception that the best ideas come out of thin air, or by getting a few product managers in a room and feeding them pizza until they crank out something innovative. But the reality is, the best ideas come from embracing diversity - of functions, seniority, disciplines, education, and more. Ask this diverse team to leverage a range of ideas that , in different domains, and look at how they can be applied to the area you’re focused on. You can add further fuel by leveraging competitive insights, market trends, user behavior data, and more. If you look at innovative leaders like IDEO, their processes, hiring practices, and client work all are oriented to leverage this principle. I’m also a big fan of user research, an important ingredient to the process we just discussed. Actually sitting with users as they go through an experience you’re looking to innovate around is one of the best ways to unearth the ‘unknown unknowns”.  (Forgive me for quoting Donald Rumsfeld.) I really love the daily LinkedIn Updates email (LinkedIn Contacts) which tells me what’s happening in my network - who’s in the news, who has had a work anniversary, job change, birthday, and more. It gives me a great snapshot of what’s going on in my network at the beginning of each day and has, for me, been a great way to stay in touch with members of my network I am not working directly with on a daily basis. And, of course, update your profile! I’m an audiobook fanatic.  The Bay Area has become notorious for its long commutes, so to help pass the time and take my mind off the bumper-to-bumper, I started listening to audio books.  I now have a shorter commute, but still go through several books a month. Sometimes, if I’m listening to a really good one, I’ll find myself having arrived at my destination, still hanging out in the car listening to it. So if you see me in the parking lot, just hanging out, you know why."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Life","LinkedIn for Good"],"author":"Elizabeth Linzer","title":"LinkedIn Employees + LinkedIn for Good InDay = InSpired Impact","date":"July 31, 2014","content":"At LinkedIn, we’re fortunate to have a day every month called to invest in our communities, ourselves, or the company, in any way that inspires us. Once a year, we rally the entire company to focus on the community during our LinkedIn for Good InDay. It’s our version of the typical ‘Global Day of Service’, but in fact there’s nothing typical about it. Because we all work at LinkedIn, a company whose vision and products are geared towards creating economic opportunity, we have the opportunity to take service to an even higher level. I volunteered with and had the opportunity to sit down with two homeless job seekers - a mother and son. They are both employed and have both held steady jobs for the past 16 and 5 years, respectively, but due to tragic, unexpected circumstances, they’re living in a shelter nearby. We spent an hour together fleshing out their LinkedIn profiles, which really means talking about their dreams, their fears, and their career aspirations. I was humbled and truly touched that they would share their story with me and that I could help them (I hope) feel the slightest bit more empowered about their futures. My greatest mentor (my dad), once told me to make sure that I worked at a place where everyone is there on purpose (pun intended). I feel so privileged to know that every LinkedIn employee is here because they want to see LinkedIn’s vision realized. So when we started planning our global day of service (which is almost completely organized by employee volunteers), my colleagues didn’t just push for 100% participation, they pushed for 100% impact. The metrics are undeniably powerful: But where these metrics come to life are in the stories -- here are a few of the top stories that showcase the spirit and intention of this impactful day: Our mission for this day was to demonstrate to ourselves and the world what a tremendous impact LinkedIn employees can make when we serve together, leveraging our passions, talents and the platform we work on every day. I think we’d all say “mission accomplished.”"},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News"],"author":"Steve Sordello","title":"LinkedIn’s Q2 2014 Earnings","date":"July 31, 2014","content":"Today, we reported our financial results for the second quarter 2014. LinkedIn achieved strong results across the business. The success of Sponsored Updates, scaling jobs, and the launch of the new Sales Navigator underscore the positive impact of recent strategic investments, and we will continue to invest aggressively in our member and customer platforms. I highly encourage you to review , including our GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation.

The full transcript of the webcast/conference call can be downloaded from our press center. See slides below. Recruitment media revenue was $18 million and $12 million in the second quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively. This post contains non-GAAP financials measures relating to the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures at and additional details regarding the use of non-GAAP measures below.  This presentation also contains forward-looking statements about our products, including our investments in products, technology and other key strategic areas, certain non-financial metrics, such as customer and member growth and engagement, and our expected financial metrics such as revenue, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP EPS, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation for the third quarter of 2014 and the full fiscal year 2014. The achievement of the matters covered by such forward-looking statements involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, the company’s results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements the company makes. The risks and uncertainties referred to above include - but are not limited to - risks associated with: our limited operating history in a new and unproven market; engagement of our members; the price volatility of our Class A common stock; general economic conditions; expectations regarding the return on our strategic investments; execution of our plans and strategies, including with respect to mobile products and features; security measures and the risk that they may not be sufficient to secure our member data adequately or that we are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of members to access our solutions; expectations regarding our ability to timely and effectively scale and adapt existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that our solutions are accessible at all times with short or no perceptible load times; our ability to maintain our rate of revenue growth and manage our expenses and investment plans; our ability to accurately track our key metrics internally; members and customers curtailing or ceasing to use our solutions; our core value of putting members first, which may conflict with the short-term interests of the business; privacy and changes in regulations in the United States, Europe, Asia and elsewhere, which could impact our ability to serve our members or curtail our monetization efforts; litigation and regulatory issues; increasing competition; our ability to manage our growth; our international operations; our ability to recruit and retain our employees; the application of U.S. and international tax laws on our tax structure and any changes to such tax laws; acquisitions we have made or may make in the future; and the dual class structure of our common stock. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company’s financial results is included in filings it makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and additional information will also be set forth in our Form 10-Q that will be filed for the quarter ended June 30, 2014, which should be read in conjunction with these financial results. These documents are or will be available on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Relations page of the company's website at http://investors.linkedin.com/. All information provided in this post is as of July 31, 2014, and LinkedIn undertakes no duty to update this information. To supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: . The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to peer operating results. . The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates internal comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates internal comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. . The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by considering the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, the company has implemented a long-term non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected long-term non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect our long-term operations. Historically, the company computed a non-GAAP tax rate based on non-GAAP pre-tax income on a quarterly basis.  Based on our current forecast, a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 35% has been applied to our non-GAAP financial results for the current period. The company believes that adjusting for these income tax effects provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from non-GAAP net income. During periods with a net loss, the company excluded certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP EPS guidance to net income (loss) or GAAP EPS guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or GAAP provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. As items that impact net income (loss) are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net income (loss) is not available without unreasonable effort."},{"post_categories":["Economic Graph"],"author":"Doug Madey","title":"Finding The “Future You,” and Real Innovation: Must Read Stories from the Economic Graph Showcase Page in July","date":"August 4, 2014","content":"Earlier this year, we launched the to feature stories from across the web from how to plan your next career move to .

Introducing LinkedIn's Field of Study Explorer","date":"July 28, 2014","content":"We recently invited several high school students to LinkedIn’s campus to talk to us about how they are navigating their search for the right University. While each student had a unique story, and faced their own set of challenges when deciding where to go, what to study and how to think about their future careers, one story really jumped out. Candice is a junior in high school who has dreamed of studying art for as long as she can remember. However, as she kicks into high gear with her college search, she keeps hearing some version of this: Despite her clear talent and passion for art, she’s leaning towards business instead because she’s been told that it will lead to a more lucrative career. But is this true? Is Candice really doomed to be unemployed if she studies fine art? Today, we are pleased to announce a new product – – designed to help students like Candice explore the wide range of careers LinkedIn members have pursued based on what they studied in school. So let’s explore the validity of this assumption: by looking at the careers of members who studied at Universities around the world. Are they all starving artists who live in their parents’ basements? Right off the bat, you’ll see that more than 294,000 LinkedIn members studied Fine Art. The five interactive graphs at the top of the page show you: Looking at the results under “Where they work,” it turns out that well-known companies, like Apple, actually employ people who studied Fine Arts. There are also a good number employed at Target and Starbucks, but what type of work are they doing there? Let’s take a look. Click on the blue bars for “Starbucks” and “Target” to see what these employees do for a living: Look at the titles: . Many of these are senior roles at Target and Starbucks directly leveraging the skills they gained in their Fine Arts educations. So whether they studied Computer Science or Philosophy, Journalism or Theater – you’ll find that LinkedIn members have forged satisfying and highly personalized careers from a wide variety of educational starting points. Like “Fine Art,” there are a number of other Fields of Study that may make parents scratch their heads or quake in their boots.

What if, minutes before you met me for the first time, someone whispered in your ear and reminded you not only where I work (LinkedIn) and what I do (product management), but also who we both know in common, whether we overlapped any years in school, or if we worked at the same company? If you knew what we had in common or any of my interests (say biking or Latin poetry), chances are that we’ll probably have a pretty great first conversation. Today, we’re excited to share that our new LinkedIn Profile on mobile does all the above. Your LinkedIn Profile is your professional identity of record. It’s also the heart of LinkedIn. Your new profile helps you tell your story to other professionals when they’re looking for you on the go. If you aren’t a master storyteller, we’ll let you know what’s missing and how you can add it. You’ll also enjoy discovering new insights about other professionals with the “in common” and endorsements sections we added. They’re great ice breakers you can use when you meet someone for the first time, so you can talk about something other than the weather. Take a look for yourself at how ridiculously good you could look in our new mobile experience: You’d know from looking at my profile that (since my latest LinkedIn post appears right at the top of my new profile), so I should probably tell you the story behind this project’s code name: . The team and I are huge fans of the movie . We called the project Blue Steel because we wanted to make you, our members, look really really ridiculously good looking.

As I read Adam’s book, , I assessed my own personality: am I a giver or a taker? Doesn’t I’m a giver make me exactly the opposite? These were some of the questions Adam raised when he came to LinkedIn as part of the Linkedin Speaker Series. He is one of LinkedIn’s most prolific and has quite the following amongst LinkedIn employees, just as he does as the most popular professor at Wharton. Through his research, he encourages every one of us to reflect on how much givers mean to the world and how we can become successful, sustainable, givers. The keyword that resonates here with me is . Adam speaks about as those who give to others without it directly hurting themselves. These are the people who find time for the , believe that relationships matter, but are also able to ask for and work towards what they want. These sustainable givers are the ones who have found a way to give without being a doormat. On the other end of the spectrum are doormats. The ones who give at their own expense, who never say no, and will probably fall in that “nice guys finish last” bucket. Sustainable givers are consciously aware of falling into the doormat-trap so they push their comfort zone by and learning to self-promote. But what about the matchers? Adam also discusses the idea that matchers are those who try to keep a relatively even tally between what they give and what they receive (or givers-in-disguise who fear being taken advantage of.) As a self-proclaimed matcher, I haven’t worried about falling into doormat-hood. But maybe I should: the risk I run not putting myself in the giver category means that I may not be aware of the potential pitfalls. Adam’s talk reminded me to reflect: how much of what I am doing do I love? How much of what I am doing is working towards my personal goals? The best part about working for a company like LinkedIn is the openness with which I can ask these questions. I encourage every giver and matcher to take a moment and reflect on the work that they are doing, and if they don’t like the answer, to make a change. Ask for advice, identify internal opportunities, and divest pieces of unfulfilling work. As I think through the next phase of my career, Adam’s words will remind me to strike that balance between company need and personal development. In this journey, I will aspire to be a sustainable giver and definitely not a doormat."},{"post_categories":["Economic Graph"],"author":"Sam Gager","title":"Strong Economic Optimism In India Amidst A Mixed Global Picture: LinkedIn Economic Confidence Outlook","date":"July 23, 2014","content":"The headline from our was “scattered optimism” about the global economy among business leaders.

Your time with the local Boys and Girls Club is covered under Volunteer Experience & Causes and you’re feeling like a LinkedIn pro. When I joined LinkedIn more than a year ago, I fancied myself a LinkedIn expert.  I’d checked all the boxes, shared content with my network and made sure my profile was always a true representation of where I was in my professional journey. What I’ve since learned is that as we as professionals grow and evolve, so do the ways we need to think about and express our achievements and aspirations so that we can be found and recognized for the things that matter most to us. Over the past year, our team has been working hard to expand the profile experience – exploring and introducing new tools to help you manage and build your professional identity to help ensure the right people and opportunities are finding you. The result? The LinkedIn Profile has become a treasure chest of options and controls – just waiting for you to explore them. As someone who is now responsible for leading the teams responsible for dreaming up and designing key elements of LinkedIn Profile experience, I’ve developed a few favorite insider tips to help members like yourself take your profile and professional brand on LinkedIn to the next level: LinkedIn is to all members so that you can publish long-form posts about professional topics that matter to you. This is your chance to position yourself as a thought leader – let people in on how you think and what you think about. Not only will you drive more professionals , but these posts become part of your professional story when they visit your profile. If this tool isn’t available to you yet, no worries, just request it . Endorsements have been one of the fastest growing and most widely adopted features across LinkedIn. Earlier this year we introduced new levels of controls to help you engage and manage skills and endorsements in a way that works for you. Select “edit” next to skills and endorsements and you’ll see you now have the ability to re-order your skills, moving those that matter most to you to the top of the pile. New levels of controls also make it possible for you to decide how involved you want to be in the LinkedIn endorsements ecosystem – from all in, to all out -- or somewhere in between. Making sure you’ve added recent volunteer experience is the first step, but did you know that you can also send a signal to nonprofit organizations to let them know you’re interested in volunteering or joining a nonprofit board? From the edit experience under the volunteer and causes section – simply select one or both of the boxes offered to join a nonprofit board or participate in skills based volunteering. Checking these boxes makes it possible for those looking for people like you, to find you faster than ever. Maybe you’re adding an example of a recently successful launch, or new volunteer experience. Perhaps you’ve recently become accredited or received a certification in an online course – or maybe you’re just giving your profile a scrub as you consider new employment opportunities. Now you can determine, each time you edit your profile, whether it’s something you want to share with your network or not.  Trying to keep a lower profile? No problem. As you’re editing, simply look for the white box that says “Notify your network?” and select either “Yes, publish changes” or “No, do not publish changes” before saving changes you’ve made. No more trying to remember what your original settings are, you can now make the choice in the moment to broadcast loudly, or keep things on the down low. Every now and then we all have the desire to mix things up a little – but we can struggle to know where to begin. Wondering what you can do to kick your LinkedIn Profile up a notch? From your profile select the box marked “Complete your profile” to the right of your profile photo. This guided editing experience will help you make sure you’ve covered all your bases while offering some inspiration on where to start and what to say as you go. If you asked just about anyone that works at LinkedIn what their favorite best kept secret is -- my guess is a majority would point to the ability to see the recent activity of your connections, directly on their profile.  This tool comes in handy before jumping into a meeting, onto a call or heading out to catch up with an old acquaintance. One click and you can see what they’ve recently shared, written or engaged with across LinkedIn. To access this, simply look for the small triangle drop-down icon next to “endorse” and select “View Recent Activity”. These are just a few of my favorite tips. Give them a shot and take your LinkedIn expertise to all new levels. Have favorite tips of your own? A profile you’re particularly proud of or a LinkedIn story to share?"},{"post_categories":["Member Stories","Veterans","LinkedIn for Good"],"author":"Spencer Lopez","title":"Help Others, Help Yourself: How I Reinvigorated My Job Search by Volunteering","date":"July 21, 2014","content":"By the end of October 2012, I had been searching for my next career for nearly 7 months. I can safely say that it felt more like 7 years. The optimism I felt when my journey first started had trickled away in a haze of cover letters and job applications that received no positive responses (or no response at all). And if my feelings of uselessness and depression at that time weren’t enough, Superstorm Sandy promptly came along and plunged my family into darkness for 10 long days. Ironically, I began to see the light after relocating to my mother’s house. When the first images of Sandy’s destruction flashed across our television screen, my own predicament suddenly paled in comparison. The instinctive need to act – an urge so vital during military service and often suppressed thereafter – suddenly came alive inside me. A call to assist with recovery efforts went out on the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America website ( ). I responded, but the Team’s operations were not easily accessible due to massive disruptions in mass transit and a gasoline shortage that made driving long distances impossible. Frustrating, for sure, but I jumped back into my job search with Team Rubicon in my thoughts and a renewed sense of hope knowing that, frankly, I was far more fortunate that many who’d been hit much harder by the storm and its aftermath. In April 2013, I participated in my first service project with Team Rubicon: an initiative to restore the New York City’s Vietnam Veteran Memorial to its pre-storm glory. It was the first time I had been around a group of veterans in a long time. What impressed me most, though, were the many non-veterans who volunteered that day. They had witnessed Team Rubicon’s efforts in Staten Island and the Rockaways, and felt a need to give back. Their efforts were truly inspiring. Later that summer, I traveled to Seaside Heights and Manasquan, New Jersey to rebuild the homes of a Navy veteran and a Gold Star family. On what seemed like the hottest days of the year, many of us worked alongside the Home Depot Foundation to bring back what these deserving people had lost. As the sweat poured down and the blisters grew, a bond formed across Team Rubicon. I’d missed that camaraderie since my enlistment ended, and it emboldened me to enter the home stretch of my job search. The four days I spent away from the job hunt had the most profound effect on my outlook. As I realized much later, putting my own problems aside and regaining a sense of purpose was the inspiration I needed to re-invigorate my own activities. Using the spark of energy from those summer service projects, I reevaluated and refined all the tools in my job search toolbox, and the fresh energy and enthusiasm helped me showcase my potential at the IAVA’s Operation Deploy: Madison Avenue career fair during Advertising Week, which ultimately landed me in my current career as an Advertising Operations Associate with MediaCom.

Well, imagine my surprise when, just weeks after my college graduation and fresh into my new job at LinkedIn, I found myself locked in a room full of seasoned user experience designers, developers and product managers mapping out our strategy for the design of . For weeks, we spent endless hours looking at research, talking to our members and rethinking the way LinkedIn could help you better manage your relationships -- and I not only had a seat at the table, but held an instrumental role in helping to shape what you see today. We created wireframes, lots of storyboards and prototyped numerous ideas - most of which never saw the light of day - but this room was where all the ideas started and biggest decisions were made. I’d like to take you behind-the-scenes today to share how the app came together and, particularly, how we embraced a design approach that is completely new for LinkedIn. Sitting among cluttered whiteboards and stacks of sticky notes, our discussions kept returning to the topic of “networking challenges” - the anxiety ridden first interaction with someone, or, months later, that all too common “do I wish him or her Happy Birthday even though we haven’t talked in ages?” when you see their Birthday pop up on your feed. Our brainstorms focused on ways in which we could take the work out of these networking moments. This focus became our North Star for what ultimately made it into the final Connected experience and we used three core design elements to help get us there. We developed a new card-based interface, a first for LinkedIn, to create an experience that is fun, light touch, and designed to facilitate “connecting.” Instead of bombarding you with content, we wanted Connected to be your go-to place for getting valuable insights about the people in your professional world. The card format we chose really encourages members to slow down, reflect, and reach out. Traditionally, animation or motion design is done as an afterthought, but given my motion design training at school, it was second nature for me to incorporate motion into my approach from the very start. Even in the early stages of the design process, I’d involve the use of animation to communicate ideas to the team. After many weeks of deliberating, crafting and fine-tuning, the final step was to test the app in a 2-week long study. One particularly impactful learning from our participants was the fact that the app, in its original form, was showing far too many cards in one sitting making the list feel endless and overwhelming. Now, when you open the app, you will notice that you see the top updates for any given day and, once you’ve swiped through them, we present you with a completion marker so you know you’ve accomplished your most valuable networking for the day. You can check an important to-do off your list in the few minutes you have while standing in line, riding the bus, or during your other on-the-go moments. The next time you’re swiping through your Connected updates, you’ll now know the countless design iterations, prototypes, and detailed decisions that went into the creation of exactly what you’re seeing.

A good first impression encourages the viewer to read the rest of your profile. In fact, your profile is 14x more likely to be viewed simply by having a profile picture. As a professional photographer specializing in professional headshots and executive portraits, I’ve learned a few lessons along the way about how to create a strong LinkedIn profile picture. Here’s my advice: [caption id=\"attachment_19836\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"250\"] Anaïs Saint-Jude chose a subtle smile and a white background in this profile photo. A tight crop fills the square with her face.[/caption] First of all, have an actual photo. No one will take you seriously if you have the default silhouette. Hire a professional to take your shot. They will get the lighting right, coach you to a good expression and maybe even have a makeup artist in tow. If you want to be perceived as a professional, you have to act like one. People can tell if you snapped a selfie or cropped yourself out of a group shot. Whose hand is that on your shoulder and why is it in your photo? Every time I get ready for a meeting, I check out the person I’m meeting on LinkedIn first, especially if we are meeting for the first time at lunch or a coffee house. If the photo is not what they look like now, I wonder about their credibility and self-confidence. Is your profile photo more than two years old? Has your hairstyle changed drastically? Do you , but not have them on in your profile photo? If so, it is time for a new headshot. [caption id=\"attachment_19837\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"250\"] Yumi Wilson wears her glasses so that she is recognizable in her headshot.[/caption] No one cares about the third button down on your shirt. They aren’t likely to need to know what the top of your head looks like. If they are thumbing their smart phone looking through photos of the 116 men named Scott Kline on LinkedIn, they aren’t going to recognize you from the shot of you on your mountain bike. from just below the shoulders to no higher than just above your head. I even crop into the top of the head in most cases. Think about your audience. Are you looking for a new job? Are you seeking credibility with potential customers? Are you trying to put customers at ease by letting them know what a nice person you are? I always recommend a gentle smile or the smile-with-your-eyes. Don’t look too corny or too serious, unless your audience needs to see that. Here are some instructions for . [caption id=\"attachment_19838\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"250\"] Wayne Pryor chose a black background and a more serious expression for his headshot, setting the right mood for his goals.[/caption] Hawaiian shirts are great for the politician from Maui. Suits and ties are great for many in the financial industry. What do people in your industry wear? If you are worried, err on the side of dressing up a little. It never hurts to have clean, new garments. Remember to look like yourself, but maybe yourself on your best day. Here are more Get the background as neutral as possible. I prefer a black or white background for the photo. Other colors can work too. Make sure there is contrast to separate you from the background. Avoid busy backgrounds like words, complex geometric shapes or lines running through your head. Solid white or grey are hardly ever a problem when your face is well lit. Now that you know how to do it, update that LinkedIn profile photo. If you currently do not have a profile photo, put on the photo that most closely adheres to these suggestions. Then, find a good photographer and get a professional headshot scheduled as soon as you can.

Rather than being discouraged and giving up, I used these challenges as inspiration and repositioned obstacles as opportunities. My passion is in recruiting. I’ve been a recruiter for more than 30 years, starting my career at a recruitment firm and now owning my own consultancy. I’ve worked hard and established meaningful relationships that have helped me realize my professional aspirations. By sharing my story of how I used my disability to fuel my career ambitions, I hope to inspire you to overcome obstacles to achieve your career goals.  My aunt was the first to fuel my ambition to do something significant. She put me in in community service clubs, debating and public speaking. Later in life, I had mentors who eventually got me into business. I surrounded myself with people who realized I had talents that I didn't even know I possessed. One is never self-made, so I encourage you to find people to push you and draw out your hidden qualities. Once I realized what I was capable of, I no longer considered my blindness as a disability, but rather as an unparalleled quality. When I was looking for jobs at recruitment firms, their feedback was, “You can't be a recruiter because you can't see” or “You can't see what candidates look like” However, not seeing someone’s physical appearance helped me bring a cerebral, unbiased approach to recruitment. My unique selling point was that I operate on raw input of data. If you interview a person, much of your impression is their packaged presentation. With me, I look at the aura that the individual communicates, and I form an impression of what they really are about. This unique ability helped me secure jobs and succeed in my career. So turn your weaknesses into valuable skills, and you’ll be able to improve your career path significantly. Finally, you should take the time to find your passion. I started my professional life as a sales manager in wholesale businesses and manufacturing, particularly in radio. I also dabbled in retail businesses. But the one thing I was good at, and was really passionate about, was recruiting. Headhunting is something that I love doing because it's a matter of mixing, matching, finding the right person and providing them with the right opportunity. If you get it right, you can seriously impact the individual and the business. My job puts a smile on my face at the end of every day. Follow your passion and find that level of satisfaction in your career, and as they say, you’ll never “work” a day in your life."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn for Good"],"author":"Ariana Younai","title":"Announcing LinkedIn Nonprofit Innovation Grant Recipients 2014 [SLIDESHOW]","date":"July 16, 2014","content":"LinkedIn for Good’s vision is to connect our members, employees, and communities to opportunities that make a positive impact on the world.

Globalization makes it happen by ensuring freer movement of capital, merchandise and people across regions. Trade policy is one of the main tools that promotes this borderless world, and that’s the reason why it has always fascinated me. My first real exposure to trade policy was in 1991 when India started its economic reforms that opened the country to the forces of globalization and free market economics. In 1995, the same year the World Trade Organization (WTO) formally came into existence, I opted for international trade as one of my electives while pursuing my Bachelor’s in Economics. My love affair with Trade & the WTO continued into my post graduate studies. I taught Economics for a brief period at a Civil Services Coaching Institute. Then, I got a chance to join India’s federal government as Research Officer (Economics) and was put to look after Trade Policy Desk. There, I could play a role (even if it was a small one) in the policy formulation of a country that was well on its path of rapid globalization. I couldn’t have asked for more. Eventually I got bored of working for the government as I felt the bureaucratic machinery suppressed all initiative. I was too ambitious for that. When I got an offer to lead the trade policy initiatives of a diversified translational corporation , I said goodbye to my government job, and left Delhi for the city of dreams Mumbai. It was risky as I had no prior work experience in the private sector. Most trade experts I knew were from government so lacked private sector perspective. I was alone in my new journey. However, I ended up getting the autonomy I was looking for in my new job. The diverse business interests of the conglomerate offered immense opportunities to apply my trade policy skills and help its businesses factor in the implications of bilateral, regional and multilateral trade pacts in their commercial strategies. However, each day I felt my existing knowledge was insufficient to deal with the complex queries I was getting. I always wanted a second opinion from someone who understood business and trade policy, and the linkage between the two. A friend suggested that I seek help on LinkedIn. I joined LinkedIn Groups such as and that connect fellow trade professionals from all parts of the world. I started posting my queries with request for advice. Many of the members sent me reports and shared links to relevant articles. That helped me a lot in upgrading my knowledge. Observing the near absence of discussion about the implications of trade policy for businesses in Indian media, I decided to write about it to present the corporate perspective. I wrote my first opinion piece about Chinese Trade Policy, and sent it to almost all business newspapers of India one by one. No one replied. Disillusioned, I approached a LinkedIn connection as my last attempt to publish my first article. He gave me two names from Business Line, and I sent one of them my piece. The next day, I got a reply that if I can cut my piece to 1,000 words, they would publish it. By writing about trade policy issues in newspapers, I learned to articulate in a non-technical language – that played a key role in my evolution as a corporate advisor. Since then, I’ve been contacted to speak at conferences and seminars, management schools and even participate in TV debates. LinkedIn has been a great platform for me to connect globally with fellow professionals, build my professional brand, and transform my career along the way."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Marketing Solutions"],"author":"Carole Zibi","title":"Relationships Matter: What We Can Learn From the Top 25 Most Socially Engaged Companies on LinkedIn [INFOGRAPHIC]","date":"July 10, 2014","content":"\"Everyone talks about building a relationship with your customer. I think you build one with your employees first,” says newly appointed Senior Vice President of Retail at Apple . The more you invest in terms of genuine listening, sharing and engagement, the more likely it is that your relationships will thrive. This has always been true for personal relationships, and more so than ever, for the relationships businesses have with their customers, and particularly with employees. The 2013 “State of the Global Workplace Report” from Gallup highlights that To find out which companies are best at engaging employees, we partnered with , Principal at Altimeter Group, to create a list of the most Socially Engaged Companies by using data of employee engagement on LinkedIn*. Discover the full list and research conclusions here: The most socially engaged companies leverage their core values to empower employees to be brand ambassadors. It all begins with authentic, meaningful engagement and content: We also found that within socially engaged companies 50% of executives are more likely to encourage employee use of professional social media. And leaders lead by example - 52% of executives are more likely to actively create and share content. Employees of top socially engaged companies are far more optimistic than those of other companies we interviewed: 52% versus 41%. Additionally, 20% of employees are more likely to feel inspired based on how companies use social media to engage with them. We also learned that social engagement builds pride among teams. 15% of those who are socially engaged are more likely to feel proud about the leadership of their company. Socially engaged employees are not just connected to those in their own department, they also expand their networks to include other employees, customers, and prospects. 59% use social media to build relationships within the company. In addition to amplified engagement, pride, and communication, relationship economics play a notable role in building competitive advantage. From attracting top talent to closing sales deals, socially engaged companies are distancing themselves from conventional companies in their industries. In a day and time when desirable talent is a precious commodity, socially engaged companies are prospering by holding on to coveted employees and winning over talented prospects. We learned that 20% of socially engaged companies are more likely to retain talent. More so, 58% are more likely to “feel LinkedIn has allowed their company to attract great new talent.” Of course, we can’t discuss social without bringing out the inevitable question of return on investment (ROI). If you measure ROI by sales leads, we discovered that 57% of employees at socially engaged companies are more likely to “feel LinkedIn has allowed them to get more sales leads.” As Brian Solis summarizes in :“When companies invest in relationships with customers, employees, prospects and partners, they reap benefits measured in competitiveness, profitability, loyalty, and advocacy. Beyond the bottom line, organizations also evolve into truly social businesses, where technology becomes an enabler for something of greater purpose, improved communication, connections, and collaboration between people.” We designed a playbook specifically for top executives to enable deeper engagement with your customers, employees and peers on LinkedIn. Inspired and validated by the profiles of the most successful leaders on LinkedIn, the Executive Playbook outlines 12 key steps to empower you in your transition into professional social media. .

In the forest behind my house, I explored new territory as a frontierswoman living off the land and a geologist who had just made an important fossil discovery. I loved looking for the next big adventure. When the movie ‘Contact’ came out, I was enthralled! To think how big the universe might be and that there might be life elsewhere blew my mind. So I said to myself, “That’s what I want to do. That’s my next big adventure - exploring space and finding life out there.” The first place that came to mind to pursue this adventure was NASA, but I had no idea how to begin. My father pushed me to go to career fairs and to get to know recruiters. He always told me, “You have to talk to people and make connections. That’s the best way to get to where you want to go.” So, as a freshman in college, I decided to pursue NASA’s co-op program, which provided students with on-the-job training over two or more semesters at one of the NASA centers. I tried for two years via the conventional method of submitting resumes to recruiters to no avail. By my junior year, I realized if I didn’t get in that year, I wouldn’t be able to participate in the program and graduate on time. So I decided to try my father’s advice. I found students who had been part of NASA’s co-op program in my university and I talked to them about their experiences. I asked them for their contacts and whether they knew anyone in the co-op selection office that I could talk to. Being an introvert, it took a lot of courage to cold-call people at NASA, but in the end it paid off. One day, I received a phone call from the co-op hiring manager at NASA and he told me that the final slot was down to me and another person. However, because I sought him out and repeatedly called him, he knew I wanted the job more. So, he gave it to me. That co-op position led to a full-time job working on designing deep space habitats, researching radiation mitigation schemes to keep people healthy during long duration space missions, and systems engineering of lunar landers to help us figure out how to settle the space frontier. Moving forward in my career, networking is even more important than before. We are entering an age when collaborations (as well as some competition) are how we will overcome the barriers to deep space exploration. One of the main tools I use regularly is LinkedIn. Here are just some of the ways I currently use LinkedIn in my everyday work: - At conferences, I meet people at networking events and collect their business cards. I write down on the card where I met the person and what we talked about. Then, I connect with them on LinkedIn and I put the details of our meeting in the relationships tab. - There are so many ideas on LinkedIn. I use the search feature in my groups to find more information about a subject. If there’s a particular person who is an expert on that subject, I’ll ask to connect with them. - I am and will always be an avid student. Recently, I’ve gotten more interested in leadership and how one becomes a good leader. I find great information on LinkedIn on this subject and am following several influencers, such as Richard Branson and Bill Gates, who I think have some really wonderful advice. I wish LinkedIn had been around when I first started my job search. It definitely would have made connecting with people much easier. The great news is I have LinkedIn now and through my connections and our shared information, my future adventures are waiting!"},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Ryan Roslansky","title":"Stay In The Know On Your Network: Newsle Joins The LinkedIn Family","date":"July 14, 2014","content":"We know LinkedIn is a place you visit to stay up-to-speed on your network, showcase and strengthen your professional identity and read content to glean professional insights that help you make more informed business decisions.

The premise of the book is that the employer-employee relationship is broken. Managers face a seemingly impossible dilemma: You can’t afford to offer lifetime employment. But you can’t build a lasting, innovative business when everyone acts like a free agent. The solution? Stop thinking of employees as family or free agents, and start thinking of them as allies on a tour of duty. Inspired and informed by LinkedIn’s founding, and filled with stories and lessons from companies throughout Silicon Valley and beyond, teaches managers how to recruit, manage, and retain today’s entrepreneurial employees. We touched on all these themes and more in the lively conversation. Here were some of the highlights from the chat: As Reid described it, think of employment as an alliance: a mutually beneficial deal, with explicit terms, between independent players. In an alliance, employer and employee develop a relationship based on how they can add value to each other. Companies need to tell their employees, “Help make our company more valuable, and we’ll make more valuable.” Employees need to tell their companies, “Help me transform my career, and I’ll transform the company’s trajectory.\" . Jeff emphasized that the Alliance is all about trust and relationships. And trust is built in the conversations that occur between managers and employees. He said, “One of the things I’m so excited by in the Alliance is that it shines a light on a fundamental conversation that all of us should be having.\" In particular, he said that when an employee and manager cannot speak openly about career goals and time horizons, it breeds distrust. “The distrust is not really explicit,” he said. “It’s not ‘I don’t trust my manager.’ It manifests more with questions like, ‘Should I really be talking about this? Should I let my manager know that I may not be here in X number of years?’” . A tour of duty represents a commitment by employer and employee to a specific, mutually-beneficial mission over a realistic period of time. Of course, there are different types of employees and different roles. Jeff named the three sub-types. Rotational tours are programmatic “on-ramps,” such as a 2-year analyst program. Transformational tours are highly personalized missions that promise career transformation for employee, and company transformation for the company. Foundational tours are for employees who cannot envision working anywhere else; who have become part of the emotional fabric of the company, and vice versa. . Jeff and I both referred to Reid as one of the best in the world at using his network to gather intelligence on what’s happening in the industry. Managers should encourage employees to do the same: look outward, tap their network, gather intelligence on industry happenings, and share what they learn with their colleagues at LinkedIn. Of course, LinkedIn is quite helpful for doing this. What’s more, encouraging employees to leverage their networks also helps them be better networked in their career later on—which exemplifies the spirit of alliance. . Reid described the creation of the LinkedIn Alumni Network and how the company aspires to invest in a lifelong relationship with its former employees. Fittingly, there were 10 LinkedIn alumni who joined us at the event.

So in 2008 when I was frustrated trying to decorate my home in Los Angeles I saw a huge opportunity to create an online destination that would inspire people and give them access to great products for the home all at a value. Voila, the idea for One Kings Lane was born. In October 2008 I met my business partner, Ali Pincus. We both believed that the opportunity was huge and if we could help improve the way people shopped in the $1.5 billion home industry we could disrupt this industry. At that time, most popular e-commerce sites were really all about breadth and searching for specific items. We saw another opportunity and set out to create a place where one could find unique and special merchandise that was carefully vetted, curated, and presented in a way that would inspire shoppers. One Kings Lane started out as a flash sale site, an online destination where shoppers could find great items for their homes at great value. The sales launched everyday with limited quantities for a limited amount of time. Today through innovation and listening to our customers, we have grown to become a marketplace full of unique items from brand-name products to vintage and antiques and one-of-a-kind pieces from high-end interior designers and celebrities. One Kings Lane is the place we had first envisioned, where we have married inspiration and access to unique wonderful products for the home. From the day we launched our first sale on March 30, 2009 it was obvious that there were lots of people like Ali and myself who love their homes and had a passion for finding unique and special decor. Five years ago when we started we launched with 5,000 members and today we have over 10 Million. What’s more, our shoppers have shown tremendous loyalty to the One Kings Lane brand – five years ago 80% of our revenue came from repeat shoppers and that statistic remains the same to this day. Today, just five years later, One Kings Lane is considered to be one of the more successful and fastest growing ecommerce sites in the world… and one of the most admired websites amongst our peers in the retail industry. I have learned so much on this journey. However, I think the four key things I have learned at One Kings Lane are: And have fun!"},{"post_categories":["iPhone"],"author":"Alyssa Sittig","title":"Ready for Your Next Career Move?

My daily responsibilities and my professional goal is to create beautiful, exciting and cool artwork. When I was a child, I was really into art, fashion, music and dancing. My dreams were to become a dancer, architect or fireworks maker. I am happy to say that I am now living my dreams because I make lights dance on buildings! I am probably one of the most enthusiastic and biggest fans of projection mapping.  3D projection mapping is a technology used to turn non-flat surfaces such as buildings or sculptures into a display surface for video projection. We use software that can interact with multiple projectors to fit any images onto the surface of the object.My interest in 3D projection mapping began about four years ago when I was a professional dancer. I was a part of Deca Dance Theater in New York and we danced with LED suits in the dark. Around the same time I started seeing some artists making architectural projection mapping installations as well. I found that there was a huge opportunity to include LED lighting and projections in our dance shows. And that’s how I got into the audio-visual world.  One of the most important skills to get into any industry, especially the audio-visual world is networking. A lot of people ask me if I went to school for visual arts. In fact, I went to Tokyo University of Foreign Language and majored in Portuguese so I didn’t know many people in this industry. That’s where LinkedIn came in. I’ve used LinkedIn to build my professional network. I researched the industry, found studios and other artists, and when I wanted to meet somebody I sent them an InMail to meet with them in person. Mentors who will help you move forward in your career are also incredibly valuable. All of my mentors told me about the importance of networking and they didn’t hesitate to help me connect with other professionals. Through Hiro Kamegawa, VJ and entrepreneur, I learned about video editing, visual effects, and VJing by working for his company . Nick Smith, my mentor for 3D, is a top computer graphics artist and taught me 3D modeling, texturing, lighting, compositing and animations. He even took me on a field trip to several studios in Los Angeles to learn more about the industry first-hand.  Once I had the right network, I had to learn about 3D projection mapping. It wasn’t easy to start because I didn’t even have a projector. So I decided to find other people in the area who were also interested in projection mapping. That’s how , an artist collective was born. We do what we call “Maplabs”, a freeform learning/experimenting lab for anybody who is interested in this technology. Through Mapjacks, I have met so many people in the field and gradually I started showing projections at various events. Within two years, I got to know a lot of people in audio-visual industry in Los Angeles and have done some amazing projects.  Here are some videos of works I have done.  from on .  from on . Currently, I work at as a lead artist and I am creating animations everyday. My industry is really exciting with so much new technology - I have a lot more to learn and I still feel like my career is just getting started."},{"post_categories":["Economic Graph","Featured"],"author":"Doug Madey","title":"LinkedIn’s Vision for an Economic Graph: A Conversation With Jeff Weiner and Thomas Friedman","date":"June 30, 2014","content":"Earlier this month, LinkedIn CEO had an opportunity to sit down with , columnist for the , at the in San Francisco.

A: Of course. People have shifted from using just a PC to using multiple devices throughout the day. They might start their day with their phone, use a desktop during work hours, and then a tablet in the evening. On top of that we also have members using more than one of our five mobile apps. So throughout the week we have lots of potential touch points with our members across devices, across apps. We’ve been focusing more of our attention on how our products work together in symphony versus as stand alone instruments. For example, if you have our flagship app, but then download our Pulse news app you shouldn’t need to login or register again. Since we already know you are a member we just let you press a button on the new app confirming it’s you and voilà you are using the app. This is just one of the many ways we are trying to compose a score for our instruments to play better together. A: While we don’t envision having dozens of apps, we also don’t want one single monolithic app. We want to keep simple, simple, so we build apps that are dedicated to specific use cases or experiences. In fact, you’ll see a brand new app coming from us in a few weeks. Our apps are like an à la carte menu. Obviously we’d be thrilled if you order one of everything on the menu, but for the most part our members just pick out a couple apps that make sense for them. A: is one of my favorite apps right now. My family has strong real estate and architecture ties. My grandfather emigrated from Italy and did a lot of residential and commercial building work. My mother was the first woman building inspector in Massachusetts and one of my brothers is an architect. I love looking at, and appreciating, great architecture and design. You learn a lot about people from the way they design and live in their home. It’s inspiring to see people who are able to get a ton of utility out of tiny spaces. I also enjoy seeing the different ways that people tackle similar space issues. A: How our members visit LinkedIn looks very different from when I started. Just over three years ago mobile accounted for eight percent of unique visiting members to LinkedIn. Today it’s 43 percent and before the end of this year it will be over 50 percent. We went from being a desktop company to being both a desktop and mobile company. My goal is to have the whole company thinking about mobile and focused on making LinkedIn work where you want to work. Looking forward we will also invest more in what I would call “anticipatory computing”. Mobile allows us to better understand your context because we carry our phones everywhere we go and they are connected to the Internet and have lots of sensors. More and more apps should just infer what I need next. It’s like going to your favorite restaurant and they know your name, what you like, and how to cook it. As a result they anticipate what I need before I have to ask. It leads to a wonderful experience and we want to capture more of those kinds of moments with our mobile program. A: If you don’t follow any you should. They are some of the top influencers in the world writing on a variety of topics. Be sure to check out the comments because they are often filled with the hidden gems. The comments are written by everyday professionals who have a perspective that is often as eye opening as the thought leaders. A couple suggestions of people I follow are (not because I’m sucking up, but because he’s talented), of Sequoia Capital and of Apple. A: During my first four years at LinkedIn, I had one of the longest commutes. I lived in Lake Tahoe, California, but worked out of headquarters in Mountain View, California. It’s about 250 miles each way, so I put over 110,000 miles on my car. That’s the equivalent of driving around the world more than four times.

We know that work experience is as important, if not more important than a good GPA. We know that an internship inspires confidence that you can get things done beyond passing an exam - that you can work with others to solve real problems in industry. Finding that first internship is tough, especially for students entering their Junior year. Many of my Chemical Engineering and Chemistry colleagues are taking summer jobs as laboratory assistants cleaning glassware. I had a better outcome. I used LinkedIn to land a promising internship without prior work experience in the field. Now I want to share advice to help you. I started a year ago, looking for internships in a wide range of chemical engineering fields, from bio applications to petroleum engineering. I searched for relevant companies everywhere in the United States. I cross-referenced the names of company executives, listed on company websites, with their LinkedIn profiles, and I sent nearly 50 different tailored inMails to company CEOs and heads of R&D, asking for their consideration of me as an intern. Having a subscription really helped me to find and contact the right people. It gave me the opportunity to reach out to professionals I was not connected to and access to everyone who had viewed my profile. Don’t send a generic InMail. I would research each company carefully, read their publications and learn about their business and technology. I tried to keep my message short, introducing myself, demonstrating excitement about the company and technology, and describing how my background would prepare me to contribute as an intern.  I would end each inMail with a request for a phone call, and provide my contact details. I got more responses after I refined and sent follow-up inMails. This was key. People respond when you demonstrate persistent interest. I got responses from, and followed up with roughly 10 CEOs to chat with them about their work. From these discussions I narrowed my interest to electrochemistry and battery technology. Having surfaced my passion for battery technology, I tailored my UCSD classes and sought out a graduate-level course in electrochemistry. That definitely helped to boost my credibility with prospective employers. My internship opportunities were heating up during a busy time for me at school.  I was able to respond timely using the LinkedIn mobile app. This worked so much better than blindly submitting a resume and cover letter to an opening on a job board. I hope this approach helps you as it helped me in networking with industry professionals and presenting yourself as a persistent qualified candidate. I’m thrilled to have landed my dream internship at a leading edge technology company called .

Since then, I developed a deep love and passion for these magnificent flying machines. I grew up in Eastern Europe in the late 80s, and trying to get into the aviation world as a pilot was not an easy task. In fact, it was almost impossible. I grew up in an environment where to become a pilot, you had to be superman (super health, super IQ, and more clever then Einstein), which put me and the majority of aspiring pilots in an unobtainable dream. When I told my parents that I wanted to be a pilot when I grew up, they never took me seriously. Even the kids in school would laugh at me. When I was 18, I applied to the only airline pilot training school in the former Yugoslavia, where an eye medical specialist told me that I would never be able to fly jets because I needed glasses. I wish they could all see me now. Fortunately, these challenges didn’t discourage me. Instead, it inspired me even more to become a pilot. I accepted that there would be challenges along the way, but that is what’s made my life more rewarding when I reached my ultimate goal. During my rewarding career as a flight instructor, I met so many different people and they all had dreams about becoming a pilot, but for various reasons delayed flying. I am no career expert, but these are the steps I took to accomplish my own goals. I hope that by sharing my story, it will help others achieve their dreams. Thanks to LinkedIn, I am now able to connect with my old colleagues I flew with professionally. I’ve also managed to connect to new colleagues who fly professionally, which is an amazing asset because networking is incredibly valuable in a 21st century career. With LinkedIn Groups, we are able to exchange information about current aircraft fleets at companies and the number of pilots who fly currently. We also discuss current aircraft fleet upgrades and potential pilot hiring based on expansions and future airplane purchases to give us head on analysis about future hiring or layoffs. My next goal is to connect with Richard Branson on LinkedIn for the opportunity to be a part of Virgin Galactic, the first commercial space flight operation."},{"post_categories":["Member Stories"],"author":"Matt Henshaw","title":"Launching a Career Comeback","date":"June 11, 2014","content":"Hello, I’m Matt Henshaw and (like the beautiful Slideshare above shows) I launched a successful career comeback. What does that actually mean? Well, a little while ago, I realised I was doing a job that was not my dream. So I decided to make a change and follow my dream – to become a singer-songwriter and self-sufficient working musician, like I said, my very own career comeback. Here’s my story and how LinkedIn played a part in it. From my time at school to the end of 2008, I was in a band called Censored. What started as a few lads from Nottingham messing about soon became serious. It was a great time - we were even supporting our music heroes, bands like Supergrass and Ocean Colour Scene. And hanging out with the likes of the Kaiser Chiefs and the Arctic Monkeys – what could possibly go wrong? I suppose I never really thought about the future and without any real guidance, we took on too much and spread ourselves too thin. I got burnt out and had to cancel gigs and festivals. Sometimes when you lose momentum, you don’t find it again. I was in touching distance of my dream career – then it was suddenly over. Skip to 2012, I was working as a Computer Science Sustainability Research Assistant – try saying that with your mouth full! It was OK, it paid the bills but it wasn’t my dream. Then I went to watch some music gigs for the first time in a long time. The Stone Roses had reformed and Jack White was playing solo shows with all the joy and freedom that goes with it. And that’s when it hit me – I’m one of these people, I’m a musician, that’s MY dream! I had to get back in. But the music landscape had changed since 2008. And it hadn’t exactly gone well last time. That’s where LinkedIn came in. I thought if this can work for office stuff why not music as well? I wanted to showcase my passion, my personality and make sure people took me seriously as a professional – not just another lad with a guitar. After updating my profile, I soon found endorsements rolling in from my old network backing my music skills.  It was a massive confidence boost.  Then I found people started coming to me! For gigs, festivals and just putting stuff together in the recording studio.  My profile was like a magnet – all because I had added a bit more detail. I now have a gig at the Camden Roundhouse and the Elevator Music Festival. You may be thinking “good for him but I don’t want to be a musician”. Well, that’s not my point. Whether you’re a musician, a lawyer, a scientist or an accountant you can always do better. LinkedIn is for anyone with ambition. It’s not going to magically make things happen for you, but if you want to follow your dream then investing in your profile and having LinkedIn in your corner can only help. LinkedIn played its part for me and it can for you. What’s your dream? Peace, Love & Tea, MHx PS.

My role as Vice President of Global Talent affords me the unique opportunity to make a positive change in closing the diversity and skills gaps in today’s workforce. While it’s easy for tech companies, like LinkedIn, to form partnerships with organizations that can promote a more balanced workplace diversity, there is a cycle of responsibility associated with transparency. This is why we thought it important to publish our own numbers regarding diversity at LinkedIn - to better ensure this accountability. And we will consistently measure ourselves and look for ways to improve. We may not be the first company to be transparent, and we hope we won’t be the last.

At some point, we’ve all thought about what might be our dream career and whether we are on that journey yet or not as our search for professional fulfillment is one of the most important in our lives. Today, we launched to highlight the professional journeys of some truly inspirational LinkedIn members. These members have not only found their dream careers, but found success while pursuing their passions. As a Director of Consumer Marketing in EMEA, I’ve been lucky enough to meet many LinkedIn members from across Europe, and have been fascinated by how professional attitudes vary by geography and culture. The differences between cultures in how people talk about and approach their careers rather reminds me of differences in humour (think the UK vs US versions of ). Us Brits tend to be ambitious, but quietly so. We worry about being too showy on our profiles. We know networking is important but are nervous about how to do it authentically and we prefer people to be understated about our success and accomplishments. What’s particularly powerful for me about the stories we are sharing today is that our members have talked about their journeys in a very British way – understated and humble seems to be the order of the day. We recently conducted research in the UK that reflects this sentiment; nearly 1/3 of Brits shy away from talking about their achievements in interviews and annual reviews and 40% admit to feeling uncomfortable when networking with people they don’t know.

I was a professional basketball player training during the off-season at a local gym outside Atlanta, when I noticed some youth playing around. School was out for the summer, their parents were at work, and these kids did not have activities to keep them constructively engaged in their downtime. Basketball has always been instrumental in my life because it provided me many opportunities and taught me about teamwork, accountability and respect, and I realized that I could use my expertise to provide at-risk youth with the opportunity to learn these lessons as well. I co-founded (B2B) with the mission of providing inner-city youth the opportunity to discover and enhance individual skills through health and fitness awareness, teamwork, life skills, and expression. I understand personally the power of volunteering for good.

Through the we found two skilled volunteers—an experienced social media manager who has grown our organization’s social reach, and a Board member who brings a strong finance background to advise us on key financial decisions.

Last year, I participated in a team outing where groups of four were given $100 and sent out into the local community to do random acts of kindness.  We could do anything with the money as long as it brightened someone’s day. The experience of going out with teammates, doing acts of kindness and then coming back together with the whole team to share what we did was one of the best days I’ve had in my three years at LinkedIn. For me, the most impactful part was listening to all the stories from the day.  One of my favorite stories was from a group that went into a wedding dress shop where they met a girl who was making a payment on her layaway for her quinceanera dress. They bonded with the girl and her family and put their whole $100 towards her dress. After they left the shop, the group got to talking and decided to pool their own money, go back into the store and pay off the rest of the dress for the girl – and even threw in a pair of shoes! When they were recounting this story, I was in tears. It was such a moving experience that I made it my personal mission to make sure that all employees at LinkedIn would have the opportunity to participate in a similar event. Last December, I began organizing Random Acts of Kindness activities in LinkedIn offices around the world on , a day each month that LinkedIn gives back to employees to invest in themselves, their community, or the world.  By the end of this year, our goal is to have every LinkedIn office around the globe participating in Random Acts of Kindness. The feedback we’ve received from employees who’ve participated has been off the charts! We’ve all shared a stronger sense of pride working for the company after participating. Random Acts of Kindness has also been an incredible team bonding experience. I can’t stress how inspiring it is to be in the room listening to colleagues tell such amazing stories of delight, compassion, and kindness. At LinkedIn, one of our core values is “Relationships Matter,” and this experience has definitely brought that value to life for our employees. Help us spread the power of Random Acts of Kindness by organizing these events in your company. It takes just a few steps to organize the event: I look forward to hearing all the inspiring stories you’ll share from your Random Acts of Kindness experiences."},{"post_categories":["Premium","Featured","New LinkedIn Features"],"author":"Dmitry Shevelenko","title":"Stand Out with the New LinkedIn Premium Experience","date":"June 4, 2014","content":"Whether you’re a new graduate or a seasoned professional, how you are viewed professionally matters.

They act as giant talent magnets for a wide variety of industries. However, our data indicates that not all of them are equal. We analyzed the migration patterns of LinkedIn members over the the past year to determine the top 10 destination cities for recent graduates. To do this, we first had to define our destination cities as places that attracted lots of LinkedIn members from a wide variety of regions in the past year. The resulting shortlist of destination cities, as defined by LinkedIn data, included some that were obvious (like Paris), and others that weren’t (like Minneapolis). Next, we ranked each destination city by the percentage of movers who were recent graduates. Below are the top ten cities, along with employers and universities of members who moved to each of the cities in our list! Paris tops our list, with Washington D.C. effectively tied for second with Minneapolis-St. Paul - a city which may come as a surprise to many. According to our data, the Twin Cities attracted a lot of members from all over the Midwestern United States. The distances these members traveled to get to Minneapolis-St. Paul weren’t as great as our other destination cities, but they were significant nonetheless. Furthermore, many of the cities that members moved from were also homes to universities, like or , improving Minneapolis-St. Paul’s standing in our list. Given the current economic situation in Spain, particularly their , we were also a bit surprised to see Madrid on the list. When we looked at the companies that hired these recent graduates, we found the majority them were international companies, suggesting that whatever jobs were to be had weren’t likely to be offered by Spanish firms. As we continue to build the , a digital map of the global economy, we’ll be able to provide students and recent graduates with information they need to navigate an increasingly complex and challenging job market. Youth unemployment is one of the most important challenges of our time, and we hope to provide meaningful solutions in the near future.

Wondering how to prioritize among several competing priorities? At LinkedIn, one of our mantras is “focus”. In fact, our CEO has even made it an acronym, shortened to FCS: Fewer things done better, Communicating the right information at the right time to the right person, and Speed and quality of decision-making. So we were honored to recently welcome an expert on the very subject of focus as part of our . , and author of : The Disciplined Pursuit of Less, spoke to our employees about how to think about what really matters. During Greg’s talk, he shared some fascinating insights about the one thing that holds back capable people, teams, and organizations. Counterintuitively, it is success. The very success that brought on the new opportunities, would be the cause for people to lose concentration and attention on what truly mattered. As Greg put it, “ .” Greg talked about how our culture celebrates the “ .” I even find myself contributing to this, saying how busy I am and trying to take on more activities, to please more people, to get just one more project on my plate. Being an engineer who appeals to logic, Greg’s basic arithmetic strongly resonated: After reflecting on this, I devised my own corollary: Most progress depends not on people doing extraordinary things, but rather people doing ordinary things extraordinarily well. And the only way to do things extraordinarily well is to focus. One of my favorite parts from Greg’s talk was his recommendation to spend 20 minutes a week to ask what’s essential right now. He encouraged us to think about the two to three goals we want to achieve in the next three to six months, and then write down the top six essential items we would commit to doing this week. After prioritizing the list in order of importance, he said, “now cross off the bottom five...and .” That mental image has stuck in my mind. Since Greg’s talk (which you can stream above), in my personal effort to join the “disciplined pursuit of less”, I've managed to cut down on a few non-essential activities. I’ve also caught myself every time someone asks me how I'm doing. Instead of my typical, breathless response of “staying busy”, I now calmly reply with a smile: “Focused and doing well.” I'm curious to hear how you think about doing \"less, but better\", in the comments below."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Michael \"Dr. Woody\" Woodward, PhD","title":"Why Values Matter for Leaders","date":"May 27, 2014","content":"Whether you are a front-line supervisor or C-suite executive, navigating the uncertainty of leading people in a rapidly changing world can be incredibly nerve-racking. Decisions are rarely black and white and not everyone will be happy with you all the time. That said, whether you succeed or fail as a leader is up to you. In my work with managers and executives over the years, I’ve found that the first step in becoming a successful leader at any level is being true to yourself and relying on a solid foundation of clearly articulated values. Naturally, this begs the question: What are values? Values are the principles and standards that guide your thinking and action. They are your basic convictions or beliefs about what is right, good, or of worth. Think of your values as that internal compass that guides you when you are unsure of where to go. Examples of commonly cited values include autonomy, affluence, family, relationships, and helping. Strong leaders fall back on their values to guide them in making tough decisions, particularly when traveling uncharted waters. The challenge for most young leaders is actually being able to articulate their values in a meaningful way. This lack of clarity results in decisions that can be a bit erratic and may often appear to be inconsistent in the eyes of their constituents. It’s as if a magnet has been placed under their decision compass causing it to randomly spin. The unfortunate reality is most management training doesn’t touch on the concept of values. To combat this, I recommend taking the time to define your own personal set of core values and then examine the extent to which they truly align with who you are and how you make decisions. Clarifying and articulating your values starts with reflection. Values can be shaped by any number of life experiences including upbringing, religion, culture, education. When exploring your values, it’s important to reflect how these factors have acted to influence your values and whether or not they have had too much influence. All too often we give lip service to values that were imposed on us rather than taking the time to really formulate our own. I always recommend fleshing out your top five values and a quick web search will yield numerous lists out there that can be really helpful. When going through these lists, the simplest way to determine which values are truly a priority in your life is to ask yourself five questions: If you are unwilling to step up and fight, sacrifice, pay and spend your precious time on something, you have to question whether it is truly of value to you. And of course the most important question is do you actually live the values you espouse? It’s one thing to talk about values and entirely another to put them in action. Your team members should be able to clearly see your values reflected in every decision. In discussing the role of values in leadership, former Medtronic CEO and author of True North, , writes “the values that form the basis for your true north are derived from your beliefs and convictions.” Orienting yourself toward your true north starts with knowing the values that form the foundation of who you are. No one should tell you what your values should be, that’s up to you to decide. Just be sure you know what they are."},{"post_categories":["Member Stories","Featured"],"author":"Sarah Acton","title":"Picture Yourself: Harnessing the Passion of LinkedIn Members","date":"May 28, 2014","content":"Today we launched , a campaign that celebrates the accomplishments of our LinkedIn members and illustrates how they have realized their professional aspirations.  As the head of brand marketing I had the honor of working with some of our members as we captured their stories for the campaign.

The short answer is: more than you can ever imagine. In 2012, I started called Employee Transformation Grants. At LinkedIn, we constantly talk about transformation of yourself, the company and the world. As a business leader, I wanted to create a program that didn’t focus on bringing dollars in, but rather on what dollars could do for the development of our employees, our company culture and the impact we have on the world. LinkedIn employees are passionate and resourceful, and I knew that with a little money and a platform for change, they would take the reigns and produce amazing results. Since then, we’ve awarded 37 grants and we’ve had three years to see these transformational ideas come to life. The stories of impact are astonishing. After two young children begged him for food from the window of a taxi, was inspired to engage his colleagues in addressing the hunger crisis. After her good friend Fred was killed on 9/11, launched a 5k run to raise funds in Fred’s honor. With the grant she went from 80 runners in 2011 to 1,000 friends and colleagues running across the globe in 2013. When their reliance on sporadic donations was threatening the livelihood of children living in an orphanage in the slums of Arusha, Tanzania, our very own stepped in with a creative solution. Plan Ireland asked and LinkedIn’s European sales team to donate $10,000, and in response they took a big risk and generated an even greater contribution. , shocked by the terror faced by a certain girl in Delhi, India, used his grant to build an emergency alert app for iPhone and Android, so anyone can easily and quickly reach out to their friends if they feel threatened. hosted a “by students, for students” day-long retreat for forty teens to learn about the dangers and consequences of drunk driving. Surprised by the opportunity, was able to give much needed assistance to a community development project started by old friends in Ruarwe, Malawi. She even got to visit and volunteer herself. What is most inspiring to me about these stories is how little we did to make this happen. Sure, we started a program that perhaps brings these ideas top of mind, and we give the best ideas $3,000 to get them started. But really, these are stories of individuals who identified gaps in the world they couldn’t let go of, who have gone above and beyond their job description to make an impact, and who as a result have helped transform our culture, our company and our world."},{"post_categories":["Influencers","Featured"],"author":"Isabelle Roughol","title":"If I Were 22: 80+ Influencers Share Lessons from Their Youth","date":"May 20, 2014","content":"Each year for a few days in May, age gets to bestow its wisdom on youth and anyone who's over 22 has advice for anyone who's not.

This mobility of professional talent can tell us a great deal about the state of economic opportunity and the health of the global economy. So we’re seeking to better understand and map the dynamics of economic indicators as we continue to build the . To get a big picture view of talent mobility, we analyzed our data to see which countries gained and lost the most talent between November 2012 and November 2013, and what characteristics are shared by those who relocate for their careers. We measured net inflow and outflow of LinkedIn members for 20 countries where we saw the most migration activity to see which were the overall winners and losers of talent in 2013. As a percentage of the total country workforce, The United Arab Emirates (UAE) saw the most talent coming into the country with the majority of members coming from India. Spain, which has been facing tough economic conditions, saw the most talent leaving the country, with the majority of members leaving for the United Kingdom. A few highlights stood out to us after digging deeper into specific country data: Most people would find it easy to conjure up the image of what an international business professional looks like, but what are the common traits among people who are more likely to work internationally? To find out, we looked at a number of characteristics that were most likely to be found among our sample set of movers vs. non-movers. The first thing we noticed was that it appears younger professionals are more likely to work internationally. Members who made a significant move in the past year had an average of 7.8 years of professional experience, but those who made shorter moves had 20% more professional experience compared to the significant movers. When we looked at the specific skills listed in the profiles of members who moved, we noticed some skills were twice as likely to be found on the profile of a mover’s compared to a non-mover’s. Below are the top 10 skill categories that were most unique to movers in the past year: Skills in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) made up nearly half the list (4 out of 10). We also noticed that members who moved in the past year that had STEM skills also tended to travel the furthest distances for their new role, averaging nearly 2,400 miles (3,900 km). So if you’re looking for a career that will allow you to see various cities around the world, you might want to focus your studies in a STEM discipline. We also looked at the most represented industries by members who moved versus those that didn’t, and found a fairly distinct separation. Finally, we looked at all of the types of work members did, and compared these various functions found within businesses by their likelihood of having members who moved in the past year. So, what can we conclude from this? Well, if you want to work all over the world, you might have a strong set of STEM skills, be a social media marketing expert, and/ or aim for business development role in a technology company with offices in the UAE. In the coming weeks and months we will continue to explore the topic of talent migration, with a focus on areas such as recent graduates, and publish the research here on the LinkedIn blog. With our feet back on the ground, we’re going to continue looking at these and related themes as we build the , digitally mapping the global economy. It’s our hope that in the near future this information will help all of our members make important life decisions (including whether or not they should make the big move) that puts them on a path to pursuing economic opportunity.

As a Spaniard, my prospects when graduating university, even when attending one of the top institutions in the country, , so you could say I am very lucky to have ended up where I am right now. However, while I’m thankful for the opportunities I’ve been given, in my opinion there is no such thing as luck. Luck is where preparation meets opportunity. I recently attended one of Sheryl Sandberg’s events, which was incredibly insightful and got me wanting to share some thoughts for those who, like me, faced the challenge of finding a good job upon graduation. This is not a very comprehensive list, and not everything will be true for everyone, as this is based in my own, limited experience: Education doesn’t finish after university. In fact that’s the point at which it starts. As mechanical tasks are increasingly replaced with automated technology, your best chance to stay ahead of the curve is to constantly update your knowledge and be creative on how you apply it. Don’t be a tourist, go where locals go. Whether that means taking a gap year, going on exchange, volunteering or interning abroad, having an international experience and additional languages will not only boost your employability, but also give you amazing memories that will last for life. Have an active lifestyle, go to the gym, play team sports, lift. The Romans had it clear: “Mens sana in corpore sano”. You don’t need to become a bodybuilder, you’d be surprised by how much running a couple of times a week helps. Find what is it you are good at. Use it to your advantage. It may be sports, math, creativity, writing or socialising. Everyone is good at something, it doesn’t necessarily have to be something impressive. Chances are your skills are easily replicable. In this case, whether someone can endure 8+ hours a day next to you or not is a major factor influencing the outcome of your interviews, so they should like you for who you are. Always tackle things with a positive mentality. It will force you to try things you would be shy to otherwise. It may go wrong sometimes, but it will go right others. Fail, learn, iterate. When things go wrong, don’t let them overcome you. Sh*t happens. To everyone. Sometimes you will be the best person for that role, but the people interviewing you won’t like you, and that is fine, it’s their loss. Again: fail, learn, iterate. Pursue a career in something you truly enjoy. If you do what you like, you will be good at it, and if you are good, money will follow. It’s true it’s easier to get a well paid job as a software engineer than, say, as a musician, but that just means you’ll have to work harder to achieve your goals. As hard as you can, you are expected to. Don’t limit yourself to your job description, try to go beyond and find ways to add value to both what you do and what everyone else does. However, don’t overwork for the sake of overworking. Ultimately, life is about people, so go meet people and have fun. You deserve it. The larger your network is, the better opportunities you will have in your future. Sometimes it’s better to hit the pub than to work on your cover letter. I believe we stress too much. And it’s understandable, being a graduate these days is very stressful. The expectations people (and ourselves) have of us are very high, and the competition is very stiff.

This metrics takes into account our health & our happiness, in addition to our career success. It consists of four pillars: We sacrifice a lot more than our time when we push ourselves to the limit. It’s vital to our health, career and success to treat ourselves more kindly – getting in the recommended eight hours of sleep a night, staying active, and making sure we’re taking time to recharge with our friends and family. In a world where we’re constantly emailing, texting, tweeting, and updating, it’s easy to live a reactionary life – one where we’re constantly being pulled in multiple directions and feeling stressed.

The purpose of the program is to encourage women in these countries to pursue STEM careers and strengthen partnerships among them. I was excited to participate as I am passionate about leveraging my technology background to give back, but little did I know that I would come out of this experience completely transformed both personally and professionally. In March, Veena Bhasavaraj and I went on a life-changing trip with the TechWomen delegation to Morocco. We met young women who had dreams of becoming positive change agents in the world. They didn’t focus on how small or big their ideas were, but rather on taking action to make a positive social impact. We learned about a project that involved technology and social media to build sustainable economic opportunities in the tourism industry for boat drivers trying to integrate back into their communities after being imprisoned. Another group is creating a portal for listing and effectively matching jobs for disabled and less skilled workers. These stories illustrate how technology can bridge barriers and help us collaborate towards a better world. Participating in TechWomen has given me the opportunity to move out of my daily routine and comfort zone and gain a new perspective on giving back to the community.  In fact, I’m so inspired that I’m making a personal commitment to give back.

As I began my first job at LinkedIn, I didn’t expect my work experience would be expansive enough to include similar activities. To my pleasant surprise, I was wrong. As part of LinkedIn’s Global Sales Organization University program – a sales rotational program for recent graduates -- leading these types of initiatives is encouraged. LinkedIn’s culture of transformation encourages employees to pursue their passions at work and to contribute to LinkedIn’s vision of economic opportunity beyond our day-to-day jobs. This week, I had the opportunity to host 50 Bay Area college and high school students for a day at LinkedIn for a “Be A Changemaker Bootcamp” event. The students worked alongside local professionals and social entrepreneurs, learning about our region’s toughest challenges and designing venture ideas to help solve them. I led this event in partnership with , an organization that supports young people in developing “changemaker” skills of teamwork, leadership, problem-solving and empathy, because I was looking for a different way to support my local community. I wanted to give back to students and education on a deeper level, and become a part of the problem-solving process for addressing social issues in the Bay Area. Early in the day, I was reminded that no matter your age, these problems are not easy to solve. Everyone at the event struggled to see clear solutions to big, systemic problems like homelessness, inequality, and the environment. However, I left the event blown away by the passion and capabilities of the students attending the event. They jumped into issues with gusto and fresh perspective, asked “why not?” with an open mind in response to their peers’ ideas. The day-long bootcamp concluded with a lightning-round pitch competition where students shared their ideas in front of a seriously charged judging panel including LinkedIn’s VP of Global Sales , Associate Director of Health Quality and Outcomes at Boehringer-Ingelheim , and Accenture Sustainability Strategy Consultant. The students came up with remarkable ideas to reduce incarceration rates for young men through international community service projects and increase internship and research opportunities for community college students by partnering with local businesses and four-year universities. I was so inspired by these students’ heartfelt pitches, and their passion to make social impact a part of their future and the future of their communities. What was most inspiring to me is that just one year ago, I would have been sitting in those students’ seats in the boot camp.

CardMunch, which LinkedIn acquired in January 2011, is one way to do this, but we know our members want more capability and functionality. So today LinkedIn is deepening our partnership with Evernote. LinkedIn members can scan a business card using Evernote’s mobile app and then directly connect with this contact on LinkedIn to maintain the new relationship. Evernote’s card scanning service is fast, reliable, and literally world-class, with support for seven languages. In Evernote, our members will be able to view profile photos, job titles and company information from LinkedIn right in the notes created when they scan business cards. LinkedIn members will now also be able to enter comments related to the scanned card and geo-tag the location where the card was scanned. We will discontinue the app on July 11, 2014. All LinkedIn members who use CardMunch and choose to transfer their existing scanned cards into Evernote will receive two free years of Evernote’s premium business card scanning service. Members will be able to quickly and easily migrate their CardMunch data to Evernote. Details can be found . CardMunch data is also available in LinkedIn Contacts on on the desktop, and in the LinkedIn Contacts app. We recognize that some members may not want to transfer their data to Evernote, so we are also giving all CardMunch users the option (including their business card images). In addition, LinkedIn members who do not use CardMunch will receive free Evernote business card scanning for one year if they connect their LinkedIn account with Evernote. A couple of weeks ago when we announced , we noted that strategic partnerships (with companies like , , and now Evernote) are a core part of our plan to reach the next three billion LinkedIn members. We’re excited to expand our partnership with Evernote and to bring LinkedIn to their users around the world. and by expanding our partnership with Evernote we can ensure that our members have the best card scanning experience possible while staying focused on what we do best."},{"post_categories":["Member Stories"],"author":"Danny Jacques","title":"Landing on Solid Ground: How I Secured a New Career after 28 Years as a Flight Attendant","date":"April 29, 2014","content":"I began my 28-year career with as a ramp worker in 1985. I learned the ins and outs of the aviation industry and watched the air crews come and go, wondering what adventures awaited them. Little did I know that a year later, I would be in the air myself starting a long and fruitful career as a flight attendant. With my home base in North Carolina, I traveled the world from North and South America, to the Caribbean, Paris and London. I always enjoyed my travels and the many new faces and friends I met along the way. I took great pride in my role, and was committed to taking the absolute best care of my passengers on each and every flight, which is why I was humbled and honored to receive the “Outstanding Employee of 2012 – Flight Attendant” award. However, during the past decade, my wife and I became primary caregivers for my aging parents and in-laws. While my flight schedule was very flexible, I felt the need to be closer to home should an emergency arise. This point was driven home in 2010 with the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland, when my flight and crew were grounded in London a week longer than scheduled (adding to the normal 10-14 nights away from home per month). In the background there was also the tragedy of 9/11 that gave cause for concern, and made me think about a potential career change when the time was right. When American Airlines extended an \"early out\" retirement offer to flight attendants in 2012, it seemed the best time to close a very rewarding and successful career in exchange for a \"new season\" on the ground at home. My final departure from American was in September 2013. It was bittersweet leaving good friends and a steady job without a parachute, so to speak, since I didn’t have a new job lined up before I left. I hadn’t looked for a new job in nearly three decades, so I knew I had to brush up on new skills, plus access available tools and resources. One of the most useful courses I took was an interactive LinkedIn class at a local community college, where I learned the importance of building and completing my LinkedIn profile. I updated my profile to include a good headshot and laser-focused my translatable skills and experiences towards sales. Once my profile was up to date, I started networking on LinkedIn. Within weeks, I built a network of over 200 connections, and reconnected with an old friend who is president and co-owner of a marketing strategies and consulting company. Since he was already familiar with my career and work ethic, he readily realized that my experience as a flight attendant would translate well into a career in sales. After several conversations, I was hired as an Account Manager at Proforma Promographix. As a flight attendant, my job was to give my \"customers\" an excellent experience that they would gladly want to repeat. As I serve my clients in like manner, anticipating their needs and making every effort to stay one step ahead of them, I think I’ll be very successful at Proforma Promographix! Now that I’m home full time in Raleigh, North Carolina, I can be a dependable caregiver for my parents and in-laws, while establishing and enjoying a new career with an income that may exceed what I was earning as a flight attendant. LinkedIn was instrumental in helping me secure this new life and career."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn for Students"],"author":"Dr. Kat Cohen","title":"You Got Into College – Now What?","date":"April 30, 2014","content":"The stress of senior year and the college admissions process is coming to a close.  We have all heard that , but you weathered the storm and gained admission to one or more of your best-fit schools.

The achievement of the matters covered by such forward-looking statements involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, the company’s results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements the company makes. The risks and uncertainties referred to above include - but are not limited to - risks associated with: our limited operating history in a new and unproven market; engagement of our members; the price volatility of our Class A common stock; general economic conditions; expectations regarding the return on our strategic investments; execution of our plans and strategies, including with respect to mobile products and features; security measures and the risk that they may not be sufficient to secure our member data adequately or that we are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of members to access our solutions; expectations regarding our ability to timely and effectively scale and adapt existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that our solutions are accessible at all times with short or no perceptible load times; our ability to maintain our rate of revenue growth and manage our expenses and investment plans; our ability to accurately track our key metrics internally; members and customers curtailing or ceasing to use our solutions; our core value of putting members first, which may conflict with the short-term interests of the business; privacy and changes in regulations in the United States, Europe, Asia and elsewhere, which could impact our ability to serve our members or curtail our monetization efforts; litigation and regulatory issues; increasing competition; our ability to manage our growth; our international operations; our ability to recruit and retain our employees; the application of US and international tax laws on our tax structure and any changes to such tax laws; acquisitions we have made or may make in the future; and the dual class structure of our common stock. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company’s financial results is included in filings it makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and additional information will also be set forth in our Form 10-Q that will be filed for the quarter ended March 31, 2014, which should be read in conjunction with these financial results. These documents are or will be available on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Relations page of the company's website at . All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of May 1, 2014, and LinkedIn undertakes no duty to update this information. To supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: . The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to peer operating results. . The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates internal comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates internal comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. . The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by including the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets.  Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, the company has implemented a long-term non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected long-term non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect our long-term operations. Historically, the company computed a non-GAAP tax rate based on non-GAAP pre-tax income on a quarterly basis.  Based on our current forecast, a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 35% has been applied to our non-GAAP financial results for the first quarter of 2014. The company believes that the inclusion of the income tax effects provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from non-GAAP net income. During the first quarter of 2014, the company excluded certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in our earnings release, which has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income (loss) guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA. As items that impact net income (loss) are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net income (loss) is not available without unreasonable effort."},{"post_categories":["Economic Graph","Featured"],"author":"Sam Gager","title":"Scattered Optimism for Future of Global Economy: LinkedIn Economic Confidence Outlook","date":"April 23, 2014","content":"LinkedIn now has professionals around the world from nearly every major industry and job level, including many executives and managers.

I used LinkedIn to land my job here at LinkedIn, naturally, and in the process, underwent major life and career changes for the better. I uprooted my life in Boston where I grew up to move to San Francisco, a city that I’ve idealized for so long and started working in the ‘tech’ industry, where growth and change are necessary to survive. It all started with LinkedIn and I want to share the steps I took so others who are looking to make a big career move can benefit from what I learned. It took months of introspection to figure out what I wanted. I had to understand what motivated me, what excited me (on a day-to-day basis) and what I was good at. I also thought about the company and mission I was working towards, and what values were important to me. There were also other difficult questions that I had to answer such as: I knew that I was easily enticed by other people’s roles, but it was easy to idealize other roles without understanding the day-to-day activities or skills needed for those roles. I talked with other mentors and trusted co-workers. One friend suggested that I research myself for an entire work week. Using a stack of sticky notes, I used one each time I felt inspired or uninspired by my work and wrote down what I was doing at that time. This exercise helped me piece together the type of work or things at work that energized me. Once I researched myself and answered the tough questions,  I was then able to craft my story. This story is my way of understanding myself and helping others understand who I am, and what value I can bring to an organization: “The common theme in my background has always  been research. With a Bachelors degree in Chemistry from Cornell University, I started off running experiments with molecules and analyzing lots of data, but realized that I wasn’t seeing the impact of my work and I wasn’t interacting with people. When I joined P&G, I was given the opportunity to research people, their behavior and use this information to shape our business strategies, which excited me. It was here that I learned the value of relationships and leadership, which challenged me to grow as a person.  I spent almost four years here and was now looking to grow in ways that the company couldn’t help me do. I wanted to be part of an industry that was undergoing significant growth and in a place where I could stretch my technical skill set. Naturally, LinkedIn seems like the next best fit. “ I did my research on LinkedIn as a company before I applied or reached out to anyone at the company. To me, this came naturally as I genuinely love using LinkedIn and researching. While I was still working at Procter & Gamble (P&G) and after figuring out what I wanted,  I reached out via InMail to , a LinkedIn employee who was a second degree connection at the time. He had previously worked in a similar role as me at P&G. Although I didn’t know Sohan at the time, we had several mutual connections, so I sent him an InMail that was both personal and friendly. I inquired about his role, his work and his transition from a consumer goods to a tech company. Sohan also gave me insight into what LinkedIn was looking for in a candidate and the skills and traits needed to be successful in his role. Although I was unsure if I should reach out (would I be seen as annoying, desperate?), I decided that I had very little to lose. In my experience, people are usually more than eager to help you out if you are sincere. After Sohan’s detailed response, I was convinced that I wanted to do something similar. I asked him to introduce me to the hiring manager of a LinkedIn job posting that I had been considering. As luck would have it, he sat next to the hiring manager of the posting and Sohan eagerly introduced me to him. For me especially, I knew that a jump from the consumer goods to the tech industry was unusual and would bring about many questions not just from interviewers but from friends as well. After some thought, I attempted to create a profile without corporate jargon and to explain my skills in a way that was easy to understand with the litmus test being my family, who still thought I ran chemistry experiments at a chemical company. My brother is a systems engineer, my mom is an real estate manager and my dad is a retired professor in computer engineering so the concept of marketing research was foreign. If my family could understand my experience, then most people would too. My research on the company and on myself prior to reaching out paid off when things started moving quickly and I was having multiple phone interviews. Balancing an actual job and interviewing, including flying out to San Francisco on a week’s notice, required careful planning and thought. I set aside time in my calendar, managed my work and blocked time off as vacation. Although I was surprised things moved quickly,  I was prepared. I am not the only one who has a similar journey. Not surprisingly, I’m now part of the nearly 100% of new hires at LinkedIn that have been impacted by LinkedIn in the past six months, which means, people who are getting hired are leveraging relationships and doing their homework, too. With an ever increasingly competitive job market and widening skills gap, knowing the right people and doing your research becomes critical to standing out. Sometimes it just takes a little motivation and courage to reach out to someone."},{"post_categories":[],"author":"Lisa Rangel","title":"How to Represent Your Unique Career Path on Your LinkedIn Profile [SLIDESHARE]","date":"April 17, 2014","content":"Most career paths today are not linear—people hold temporary roles, take on , take time off, have gaps of unemployment, and even change industries altogether. Our career paths are not meant to be simple, and the truth is, some of our most trying career (and life) moments can teach us the most. Wherever your personal career journey has taken you, it’s important to figure out how to communicate that story to a potential employer. Here’s how to represent the following scenarios on your LinkedIn Profile: Learning how to handle these alternative employment scenarios on your LinkedIn Profile will bolster your confidence, attract attention from hiring managers, and lead to more interviews for the jobs you want. It’s common to develop new interests throughout the course of your career, and the secret to successfully doing so is learning how to articulate your rationale to hiring managers. , Principal at The Recruiting Inferno, believes humor can help. He says, “Hiring Managers have to realize that most people make career swerves. Talking about those non-linear paths with humor and insight is my style.” Steve helped , a LinkedIn member, re-write his resume to reflect his change of heart about law school. Take a look at how Nick handles this directional shift on his LinkedIn Profile: This approach isn’t for everyone, but it matches Nick personality and demonstrates the resiliency through uncertainty. It’s becoming more common for hiring managers to address long-term unemployment periods during the hiring process, so it’s wise to be prepared to address it openly and honestly. President of ITM Group, observed that successful candidates with long-term gaps list out the activities they pursued during their unemployment periods in a similar way as employment positions. If you list volunteer activities, remember to include your accomplishments just as you would with any job. Consider this example from a senior Human Resources executive who experienced a long-term unemployment period: Focus on the skills, responsibilities, and experiences you had during your volunteer activities, and present them in a way that translates to the workplace. We are more than our careers, and many people make the decision to take time off from work to raise their families. It’s a personal decision that most employers and hiring managers understand. Here’s one way to represent your stay-at-home period: Representing a personal illness or family member care is trickier, and HR advice is mixed. Some HR experts recommend never discussing healthcare issues, in case your health issues impact the hiring decision, but some people prefer to be honest. One approach is to label periods of health-related unemployment as sabbaticals, which suggests that the time off was planned but does not give a direct cause for the break. If you do decide you want to disclose the reason for your medical leave, here’s one way to address it directly: If you decide to disclose family leave, one option is keep your profile optimized with your most recent title in the title section, and then write a few indicate that you are taking interim assignments while on family leave. Part-time employment is a common scenario, and it’s best to be straightforward when addressing it on your LinkedIn Profile. The example below is by someone who worked full-time at a company in a staff-level marketing role, but was promoted into a part-time manager role because there was no need for a full-time marketing manager. The employee treated this promotion like any other promotion, while also directly calling out that it was part-time. Landing a temporary position is a great way to work towards a full-time role within a company. If you are converted to a full-time hire, be proud! Make sure to indicate that you transitioned into a direct hire position from your temporary role. The employee below used a bullet point to call out his transition from a temporary manager to full-time. Your career path is as unique as you are, and you should never feel pressure to conform to a standard career progression. By effectively positioning your non-linear career path on your LinkedIn Profile, you will catch the eye of hiring managers and set a clearer understanding of what you’ve accomplished in your career."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Deep Nishar","title":"The Next Three Billion [INFOGRAPHIC]","date":"April 18, 2014","content":"We are excited to announce that we reached a big milestone today: there are now more than 300 million LinkedIn members in the world!

In 1996, I was four for four,\" he admits. but with medical treatment, he was able to bounce back. \"Looking back on my past, things began to make sense. It wasn’t the world against Boone. It was Boone against Boone.\" For personal finance powerhouse , the world was almost too kind and that turned out to be her blessing and her curse.

Support. Belief,\" she writes. \"The curse? I assumed that those attributes were something I would encounter throughout my professional life.\" They were not, and as her career progressed, she learned not to rely on the kindness of strangers.

She recounts being publicly disavowed by her mentor when she started a new job. Not having to please him or satisfy expectations allowed her to take the business in a new (and eventually more profitable) direction. Because eventually that's what curveballs do: free you – in a not always pleasant manner – from a past situation to launch you into something new. Doing away with the baseball metaphor for a bit , Redballoon founder refers to \" :\" \"one door closes, another one opens, and often we are not quite sure which door is next.\" Curveballs – for her it was – open a world of possibilities that never would have existed otherwise. understood this too when he closed a door himself, selling Virgin Records, to give a fighting chance to his new venture, Virgin Atlantic. \"I found myself running down Ladbroke Grove in London with tears streaming down my face and a $1 billion cheque in my pocket.\" The final word must go to one Influencer with far more legitimacy than I in extending the metaphor: , co-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers and more than a dozen other baseball teams in his lifetime. \" – not knowing when, where, or how the ball will drop, but anticipating the unexpected and then being nimble and agile enough to adapt to whatever is thrown at you – before you strike out,\" Guber advises. \"If don’t handle curveballs well, someone else will.\""},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Mobile","Featured"],"author":"Nicole Williams","title":"Professional Photos on LinkedIn Are Worth a Thousand Opportunities","date":"April 22, 2014","content":"In this time-constrained world, we don’t have a thousand words to explain to hiring managers, potential clients, colleagues or future bosses who we are as professionals. Instead, let your photographs do the talking. I’m not talking about pictures of after-work tequila shots and bikini vacation photos in the bars. Keep those far, far away from the Internet because you just never know who is going to see those photos and how they might affect the way people perceive you professionally. But the right picture is worth a thousand words if you can use it to reinforce your brand and build professional relationships. to show your talent rather than just talking about them. Talk about a professional goldmine! When you use photographs to exemplify your work and stand out from the crowd, they pack a punch. In fact, members who share images with their LinkedIn network are five times more likely to have other members engage with their update. Clicks and pics can be a recipe for professional success. Today, LinkedIn announced the launch of photo sharing on LinkedIn for Phone which will be rolling out to all members over the next few weeks.. This means it’s even easier for all LinkedIn members around the globe to share their professional photos while they are in the moment and on the go via Android, iOS and the mobile web. Not sure what kinds of photos you should snap and tap on your phone? Here are four suggestions: Show your network that you take your career development seriously. Photos not only help you get credit for investing in yourself, they also provide you with an opportunity to share key learnings with professionals who weren’t able to attend an event. If you’re at a conference, snap a shot of the speaker and pop one of their quotes in an . Photographs that capture ‘a day in the life’ are often even more meaningful than basic job descriptions. Bring the passion and energy that you have for your career to life. Use photographs to capture fun, inspiring or motivational moments throughout your day.  Whether it is the view from your desk, a photo of your awesome team in action, a shipment of beautiful flowers or the latest new product you’re stocking the shelves with, capturing these moments helps you remember your work day highlights. It is also a way for other professionals to see what a day in your career is like. The only thing better than telling a client, hiring manager or boss how talented you are, is to show them. If you are an interior designer, show the remodel you’ve been working on. If you’re a hairstylist, proudly show off photos of the latest up-do you created. Dog walkers and veterinarians can snap photos of happy “critter clients” with their pet parents’ permission. If you’re a yoga teacher who just redesigned your new studio, snap a picture and share your new digs with your network. How important is it to have a photo in your ? The answer is extremely. A profile with a photo is 11 times more likely to be viewed. Rather than using the typical headshot, try having someone take a shot of you in the midst of your work – during a presentation or practicing a big speech - or even in front of oven in your kitchen whites if you’re a chef! Or turn the camera on yourself. If a client or potential employer can really see you in the context of your work, it creates an equation that looks something like this: YOU + TALENT = OFFER/OPPORTUNITY."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Michael \"Dr. Woody\" Woodward, PhD","title":"It’s Not Intentional, It’s Just Their Personality","date":"April 10, 2014","content":"Every workplace has its own unique cast of characters who drive the overall culture of the organization. Regardless of how harmonious this culture may appear, we must keep in mind that every cast member is different and has the ability to contribute to or detract from that harmony. The challenge is that when it comes to spotting what sets us apart, we tend to focus on superficial differences such as gender, race, and ethnicity. Although it’s natural to focus our attention on the obvious, it’s not always the right path, particularly when it comes to building relationships and fostering team cohesion. The fact is one of the greatest drivers of misunderstanding and conflict between individuals is personality. One of the key reasons for this is that we often mistake personality for intent. In other words, we have the tendency to assume a colleague is different from us, when in fact she is different from us. For example, some people are more extroverted and assertive whereas others are more introverted and reserved. In meetings, this can be a challenge when the extrovert feels the introvert isn’t contributing as aggressively as desired, when in fact, the introvert is just processing, reflecting, and waiting for the right moment. Other less obvious differences can include an individual’s need for structure, routine, and control vs. someone who is wide open, fluid, and collaborative or how agreeable someone is vs. someone who tends to stick to their guns. The key point to remember here is that these differences are natural preferences that will often drive behaviors counter to what is natural for you. They are not intentional acts designed to undermine you. When it comes to understanding personality differences, one of the most researched models is the five-factor model also known as the Big Five. The theory is that there are five major trait categories that describe our personality. According to the Big Five, we all consistently fall somewhere along each of the following five continuums that many refer to as OCEAN: Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion/introversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. At the open end, individuals are highly interested in experiencing new things and are flexible in their thinking, where at the opposite end, individuals are more closed and rigid in how they approach new experiences. : Those who are high in conscientiousness tend to be diligent and dutiful in the way the approach work and life. Individuals who are lower on the conscientiousness scale tend to be big picture thinkers and less interested in the details of how things get done. Probably the most recognizable personality trait is extroversion because it’s easy to see. Extraverts are socially assertive and gain energy from performing for and interacting with others. Introverts draw energy from reflection and tend to prefer working alone or in small groups. This scale looks at the level of friendliness versus hostility that someone tends to display when interacting with others. Those high in agreeableness are more trusting and modest whereas those low in agreeableness are more suspicious and oppositional. Those who are highly neurotic tend to be less stable and frequently demonstrate negative emotions. Those who are more emotionally stable are generally more pleasant and tend to be more resistant to stress. Diversity of personality is often a key component to building a successful team. Take the time to get to know and understand the personalities of those you work with. There are numerous personality assessments out there on the market, most of which are about as useful as taking the latest Cosmopolitan quiz. So, when looking for an assessment, be sure to work with a trained professional and seek out those assessments that have some foundation in or strong overlap with the Big Five."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Mobile","Featured","Android"],"author":"Tomer Cohen","title":"The Power of LinkedIn is Built into Your Samsung Galaxy S5","date":"April 11, 2014","content":"Today, starts shipping the much-anticipated Galaxy S5 smartphone, which includes a first-of-its-kind integration with LinkedIn that will enrich your work life, helping you be more productive and successful.

Unfortunately, it’s located halfway around the world and it’s just not the right time to make a big move. You have all the right skills for a challenging opportunity, but it’s in an industry you have little knowledge of which makes you nervous about applying. A role opens up at your current workplace in a different department - you’re really interested but you just don’t have time to speak to HR. Many of us have, or will be, faced with similar situations during our careers. And for most of us, it ends with regret. We tell ourselves “I will go for it next time.” This is poor talent alignment in action – skills not being applied where they are best suited or where they could be most productive. It’s obviously an issue for us as individuals – as well as for employers – but have you ever stopped to wonder what these decisions mean for the broader workplace? LinkedIn has, which is why we asked PwC to explore why some countries are better at matching people with the right opportunities than others, and how it can be improved. The study combines data from LinkedIn's 277 million members and PwC’s database of over 2,600 global employers to show that there is huge variation in the ability and willingness for employees to move to wherever their skills are best suited. Employees in The Netherlands are most able to do this, largely due to its multilingual workforce and diversity of international businesses, while those in India and China appear to be the least able to adapt, which can be explained in large part by the lack of sector diversity in those countries. So what does this mean for you as a professional? We found that employers in adaptable countries reported greater productivity from their people, which benefits everyone. In fact, if all 11 countries were as adaptable as the Netherlands, there is an opportunity to tap into an incredible US$130 billion in unrealised productivity. By talking to employers, one thing stood out. They value adaptability and are increasingly relying on online professional networks to seek out people with the right skills both externally and internally while improving their ability to reskill their existing workforce. So how can you improve your adaptability so that you’re always in a position to move your career forward? Here are 5 tips to future proof your career: The ability to adapt is one of the most sought-after attributes in employment today, so stay ahead of the curve by investing in yourself, building your online professional profile, and being bold."},{"post_categories":["Member Stories"],"author":"Sabrina Johnson","title":"Finding My Way Home on LinkedIn","date":"April 9, 2014","content":"For the past seven years, I pursued a career in recruiting in Las Vegas, NV at Capital One. Although my career was going pretty well, I felt like something was missing both in my job and in my personal life. Professionally, I wanted a new opportunity that would better leverage my passion for building relationships with clients. Personally, my elderly parents were battling health concerns back in my hometown of San Diego, CA and I wanted to be there for them. And most importantly, as a single mother, I was dedicated to raising my 3-year-old daughter in a city that offered her more opportunity and positive family influence than Las Vegas. When I was ready to start my job search a few months ago, I knew exactly where to turn first: LinkedIn. I got my job with Capital One through LinkedIn back in 2012, so I believed wholeheartedly I could use it once again to change my life. Within five minutes of updating my LinkedIn Profile, I was contacted by a connection who worked at Robert Half Technology (RHT). Soon I was interviewing for a role at RHT with the The Creative Group based near San Diego (my dream location), for a position where I knew my strengths would shine. During these interviews another recruiter also contacted me, just 24 hours after updating my profile. It was fantastic to have options, all stemming from a simple LinkedIn Profile update. I gave myself a deadline of April 2014 to move to San Diego. As luck would have it, I accepted an offer with The Creative Group at RHT and started my new career journey on April 1. Not only was I able to achieve my goal of moving home, but LinkedIn provided me a doorway to a dream job with increased income and full benefits – huge wins for a single mom!

Like many other online services, from time to time, legal authorities will ask LinkedIn for information about our members’ online activities. In many cases, governments may need this information to investigate crimes. At LinkedIn, we’re committed to earning and keeping your trust in everything we do, so we have a high bar when it comes to responding to government requests for member data. We only provide data when we believe that we’re legally required to do so, unless it’s a rare emergency situation, and we carefully scrutinize and evaluate each request. We take steps to let members know before we turn over their data, unless we’re legally prohibited from doing so or the request is an emergency. Since 2011, we’ve published on a semi-annual basis to help our members and the public understand the frequency and types of government requests we receive for member data. We believe that our members benefit from understanding the extent to which government authorities request member data from LinkedIn and that governments will act more justly when their activities are transparent Our current report shows that in the six-month period from July 2013 to December 2013, LinkedIn received 72 government requests for data affecting a total of 110 accounts around the world. 56 of those requests came from the United States. The number of accounts impacted by government requests for data thus represents an extremely small fraction of the 277 million LinkedIn members worldwide.

LinkedIn has introduced publishing/content creation, a new feature to empower members. At the end of February LinkedIn decided to grow their even more by opening up the LinkedIn publishing platform to members. The initial launch included 25,000 members with plans to roll out the feature for more users over the next few months.

We asked our Influencers – top CEOs, analysts and other thought leaders in all realms of business – to describe the state of their industry, what the present looks like and what the future holds. Their assessments varied from urgent pleas to fervent odes, but they all agreed on one thing: no industry today looks the way it did a decade ago and none will look the same a decade from now. The only constant, as the saying goes, is change. Technology is the great disruptor. It has, for instance, transformed America's energy outlook.

That’s why the LinkedIn San Francisco office hosted our annual “Mentor[In]” session with ten senior leaders to learn from their successes and failures. From the importance of having a mentor to managing a mentoring relationship, these were some of the most valuable takeaways from the day: Having a mentor can help you figure out your career path and introduce you to others who you may not have a relationship with yet. She can share her personal career experiences and help you think through your own. She can teach you how managers think so that you can contribute to your own team as a leader. Most importantly, your mentor can help you realize your strengths and weaknesses, and empower you to capitalize on your strengths. Typically, you are limited to your first degree connections when thinking of mentors. Your manager is more senior than you so she likely has relationships you may not have. Don’t hesitate to ask your manager to facilitate an introduction if she knows someone who’d be a good mentor for you. With each mentorship discussion, it is important to have an agenda and a goal in mind. Do you want to go from an individual contributor to a manager? Make sure your objective is clear. While a mentor can help you figure out your strengths and weaknesses, it is important that you know what you want in your career. By having a goal, your mentor can help advise you on how to get there. One of the key pillars of LinkedIn’s culture is of self, company and world. In just an hour with these senior leaders, we learned so much about how mentors have helped them transform their careers and how their experiences could apply to our own.

With this in mind, we wanted to highlight some upcoming changes to our Terms of Service (which includes our User Agreement and Privacy Policy). Over the past two years, we welcomed SlideShare and Pulse to the LinkedIn platform, and we’ve done a lot to make them a core part of what LinkedIn is today. To further simplify the member experience, we will integrate SlideShare and Pulse’s Terms of Service into LinkedIn’s, so you’ll only have one set of terms to agree to when interacting with LinkedIn properties. Additionally, we will enable you to discover opportunities and share content across our services. For example, your SlideShare experience can be personalized based on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your engagement with content from both services. Or with Pulse, we’ll be able to deliver the most relevant personalized professional content to help you stay informed. Here are some other changes you’ll see in our Terms of Service:  when it comes to responding to government requests for member data and that hasn’t changed. In Section 2.14, we clarify that we will take steps to let members know about demands for their data unless we’re legally prohibited from doing so or the request is deemed an emergency. We also specify that we may dispute such demands if we believe they are too broad, too vague, or lack proper authority. While it is not new that LinkedIn offers premium services that give our customers access to members’ profiles to generate career and business opportunities, we’ve rewritten Section 2.12 to clarify that our corporate offerings include Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions and Sales Solutions. As LinkedIn expands our services globally, we recognize that the mobile phone has become a ubiquitous communications tool.

Despite a high demand for talent, there’s a widening gap within the tech industry in the number of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) roles held by women. For all its accomplishments and innovation, the technology industry is lagging when it comes to representing an equal balance in the workforce among women with technical backgrounds. We had LinkedIn researcher, , look into this imbalance and according to LinkedIn data: This raises an important topic for discussion: if technology will help to define how we work in the future, how can that future be meaningfully realized when women aren’t playing a more significant role in shaping it? We believe strongly that providing the right support in the form of role models could yield positive results in terms of getting more women in STEM positions, and it could also be an effective measure in balancing out the gender gap. And because we believe further steps need to be taken, today we’re pleased to announce our partnership with , a national nonprofit that provides all STEM students with access to high-quality mentoring experiences by connecting them with professionals in their field. Using an online social networking platform, students (called protégés) can build relationships with mentors, connecting across generational, gender, racial, cultural, and socio-economic boundaries. Our partnership with MentorNet includes a grant to help update their technology platform, which will enable them to scale their impact. It will also allow MentorNet to leverage job postings in order to fill a critical need for great mentors, as the supply of protégés tends to heavily outweigh that of available mentors. Additionally, , it will provide MentorNet with the ability to leverage our growing network of 277 million professionals to identify members who might be interested in becoming a mentor and match their subject matter expertise with a willing protégé. To date, more than 600,000 LinkedIn members have indicated their interest in either serving on a board or doing skill-based volunteering. MentorNet’s CEO, , first became involved with the organization as a mentor herself. As a computer scientist, having her own mentor was invaluable in helping her navigate challenges and persist in a tech career. As LinkedIn data indicates, support for MentorNet’s mission couldn’t come at a more critical time, especially within the United States, as female representation among U.S. computer science and software engineering degree holders has declined over the past 30 years. In 1984, 23% of U.S. degree holders were women. As of last year, fewer than 15% were women. Unfortunately, . Compare this to India, where female representation has increased dramatically from 20% in 1999 to 31% in 2013. The increase of female computer science and software engineering degree holders in India is so dramatic, that prior to 1999, there weren’t enough members to include in our analysis to provide a robust result. In fact, the overall global trend of female representation is increasing - ever so slightly - due in part to India’s contribution. These are significant, fundamental challenges, and no single action by one company, entity or even group of companies and entities is going to address all of them. However, we’ve identified an area where we believe we can have significant impact, as it relates to one of our core areas of focus: the power of professional ties and the sharing of knowledge. Our vision as a company is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. The development of the and work of organizations like will help make that vision a reality by providing real time insights and awareness into the shape and scale of problems like gender inequality in the technology sector."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Ariel Eckstein","title":"Thank You to Our 15 Million Members in the UK","date":"March 11, 2014","content":"It seems like only yesterday we announced LinkedIn’s and today, less than two years on, we have surpassed 15 million members.

She started volunteering, got a part time job, and opened up to the support offered from the staff at BGCSF. She took the opportunity to build a foundation of safety, support, and consistency at the Club.

I was lucky enough to be awarded one of these grants to partner with the Boys and Girls Club of San Francisco on a Youth Storytelling Program. Over the last eight weeks, we built a core team of subject matter experts and volunteers to design a program that introduces valuable storytelling skills to help youth succeed in landing a first job or college acceptance. This program teaches the basics of great storytelling through the Hero’s Journey. One step at a time, participants build their own story using a hero from their own life. Throughout the process, they build confidence and conviction, learn what makes great stories and deliver their own story to the world. Two weeks ago, we launched the first version of the program to the leaders at the Boys and Girls Club of San Francisco.

It’s such a rewarding experience to guide people through their personal development and see them achieve their career goals.

I knew I had to try something different, so I turned to LinkedIn. Once I updated my profile, I started connecting with people I had worked with in the past and with recruiters at companies I was interested in working for.

The so-called promotion from player to coach is one of the toughest transitions you will make in your career. The reason I say “so-called” promotion is because the move to boss isn’t always what it’s cracked up to be. It’s one thing to be great at doing what you do, it’s another thing entirely to be great at working through others to get the job done. One of the greatest challenges new bosses face is the aura of their star power. Most promotion decisions rely solely on one criterion for advancement into management: being great at what you do. The problem with this practice is that being a star player doesn’t often translate into being a great coach. Consider the fact that it’s rare to find a great coach in American sports who was also a great player, or even a decent player for that matter. Keep in mind neither Pete Carroll, head coach of the reigning Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks nor Eric Spoelstra, head coach of the reigning NBA champion Miami Heat ever played professionally. The tendency in the business world to promote star players can be quite a burden for both the new manager and their former colleagues who are now subordinates, because the expectations are often too high. Throughout my career I have spent a lot of time working with young managers on the transition from player to coach, so for those ready to make the leap, here are some of the lessons I’ve picked up along the way: All too often, I come across managers who haven’t fully dealt with past experiences and failures that left them scarred which have now become an integral part of how they view and manage others. Dealing with the past isn’t always easy, but it’s a critical life skill. The fact is, you have to know yourself before you can effectively manage others. The way you manage is a reflection of your personality, values, and upbringing. Take the time to think about how your life journey has shaped the way you manage and make decisions. The idea is to put your best foot forward and do it in a deliberate way. Decades of surveys have found that most people leave their jobs because of bad managers. The unfortunate reality is most managers never receive any kind of meaningful management training. Managing people is both an art and a skill. There is no doubt some people are naturally more adept at leading others, but the basic skills for managing people are very trainable and it’s up to you to seek out that training. Start by inquiring about the training opportunities available in-house and then look to external programs and coaches to fill the gaps. At the outset, focus on communication, decision-making, and conflict management. The word “delegation” has almost become synonymous with management and for good reason. When moving to the role of boss, your responsibility is no longer just to yourself, it’s to your team. Managing is not about doing the work, it’s about making sure the work gets done. A challenge I often come across with new managers is their temptation to fall back on doing the work themselves as opposed to developing their team members to do the work. Be proactive in stepping back and staying out of the trenches. If you spend too much time working alongside your team, your team members you will quickly lose sight of the bigger picture and you will also become less available to those team members who need your guidance. Great coaches identify the strengths of their players, work to draw them out, and then position those players in a way that will leverage those strengths for the benefit of the team. They are chess players, focused on strategy and always looking to control the board. Great managers, just as great coaches, thrive on working through people to achieve outcomes. Their gratification comes from choreographing the successful performance of their stars, not being the star.

Since I was a kid, I used the latest breaking news to tell stories to convince people to support my cause.  When the Internet arrived, I became obsessed with using technologies to scale my ability to make an impact.  These days, I love being in the sweet spot where marketing meets technology. So it may be no surprise that I found eight of my last career building opportunities on LinkedIn. But if you’d told me when I graduated from college that LinkedIn would be my secret career weapon, I wouldn’t have believed it. In the decade since graduation, thanks to LinkedIn I’ve landed several dream jobs at amazing companies like , , and . I’ve also received professional opportunities to serve on a corporate board, act as an expert advisor to institutional investors, and speak at conferences—all because of my activity on LinkedIn. Given all the success I’ve experienced with LinkedIn, I wanted to share some advice on how anyone can use LinkedIn to build their career:  I spend a considerable amount of time . I brand myself in the Summary section as a cutting-edge digital marketer. I list out Honors and Awards to highlight my accomplishments. I seek recommendations from people I work with. And most importantly, I build and manage my professional network through connections on LinkedIn. These efforts have paid off time and again. Most recently, in 2012, when I was on sabbatical and not even looking for a job, I received a LinkedIn InMail that led me to my current role at Conde Nast Entertainment. The Conde Nast VP of Recruiting contacted me because their Chief Digital Officer found me on LinkedIn and really wanted to meet me. I was told, “he was very impressed by my LinkedIn profile.\" Earlier in my career, I was looking to switch from a full-time job to more flexible consulting work. As luck would have it, two recruiters on LinkedIn contacted me for consulting assignments. One was for the Los Angeles Times and the other was for Disney Interactive. I got hired for both assignments and it changed my career trajectory. The Los Angeles Times assignment ended up being a year-long consulting engagement where I was leading the digital team on using digital analytics to make editorial decisions. At the same time, I was consulting at Disney Interactive doing search engine optimization, which later became my full time job. I never thought that I could pursue two very different opportunities at the same time. LinkedIn made that possible. In 2010, I had to choose between two offers (one from eBay and another from Omnicom, a digital agency). I spent a lot of time on LinkedIn learning about my potential coworkers. I studied their career progress and transitions, read their professional recommendations, and saw what professional groups we shared. These insights helped me determine which company was a better fit for me. I ended up choosing Omnicom to work on the agency side and had the time of my life. I often receive from recruiters and staffing agencies who are looking to fill digital marketing positions. Even when I am not looking for a new job, I make it a point to respond and be helpful. Using my network on LinkedIn, I have connected several strong candidates to amazing career opportunities. This is my way of giving back to the LinkedIn community that has given me so much. While I was at Omnicom, I received an InMail from a recruiter. I responded to let them know that I was not in the market for a new job but thanked them for reaching out. A week later, this same recruiter tracked down my office number and pitched me again. Long story short, two months later I found myself in a new job as J.Crew's new Sr. Director of Digital Marketing. If you admire someone professionally, reach out to them on LinkedIn. You never know what opportunities might be waiting. In 2011, one of my LinkedIn connections, someone I’d never met but greatly admired, sent me a message on LinkedIn to connect over coffee. Our conversation on the education space led me to meet the founders of , a NYC startup known as the \"OpenTable for education,\" and led me to joining their Board of Advisors. LinkedIn was magical in brokering these connections and encounters that led me to a board seat. With LinkedIn, I didn’t have to seek out opportunities because I was fortunate enough that opportunities found me. LinkedIn has significantly propelled my career forward by matching my passions and talents with amazing and unexpected opportunities. LinkedIn has been a key tool for my career discovery, and I wholeheartedly believe that it will continue to be my secret weapon for the rest of my career."},{"post_categories":["International","Featured"],"author":"Derek Shen","title":"Introducing LinkedIn’s Simplified Chinese Beta Site","date":"February 24, 2014","content":"A few moments ago, LinkedIn expanded its presence in China by launching a beta version of our branded “领英”, to offer a more localized service to our members in China.

For example, told us LinkedIn opened her eyes to a world of job opportunities. Through LinkedIn, she first landed a job with a multinational financial services company in China. That experience enabled her to move to CCTV where she currently works as a TV anchor on its financial/business program. “To me, LinkedIn is like a mentor. It’s changed my life in a big way, and I am very thankful for that,” Amanda said. Another member, , was honored to receive the 2013 , the country’s highest recognition for foreign nationals who have made outstanding contributions to China’s economic progress, from Vice Premier Ma Kai. Majdi told us the award recognized his efforts at facilitating, via LinkedIn, the employment of foreign experts and local professionals in China. Success stories like these remind us of how our members all over the world use LinkedIn every day to build their professional identities and careers and to create economic opportunities. They also drove us to find new ways to connect China’s professionals, who represent about 20 percent of all knowledge workers in the world, with our global member network. We know many professionals in China and other parts of the world prefer to communicate in their native language, particularly in a business context, and so we are excited to introduce a beta version of LinkedIn in Simplified Chinese. This will make our services localized to more members in China, so they too can leverage LinkedIn to further enhance their economic circumstances. Simplified Chinese is now one of the 22 languages we are proud to support around the world. The launch of this beta version of LinkedIn in Simplified Chinese is part of our commitment to create locally relevant products so professionals can get even more value from LinkedIn. For example, we added local features, such as integrating Sina and Tencent into our platform so members can easily import their Weibo contacts, invite other professionals to join their networks and reach a broader audience with their status updates. Our members who have WeChat accounts can link both accounts, so that they can more rapidly broaden their professional reach and share relevant news and insights across both networks. If you are already a LinkedIn member, you can broaden your LinkedIn network by sending invitations to your professional contacts individually or more widely by importing your address book onto the LinkedIn platform. By , you can easily switch your LinkedIn language settings to Simplified Chinese. After the change, you may notice a difference in your experience because we are in the very early stages of building our Simplified Chinese site, so some features such as “Groups” are not yet available. Consistent with our “members first” approach, we would like to get your about this version so we can keep evolving the site by introducing more features. As we do everywhere in the world, expanding our presence in markets also means a new level of engagement with the relevant government authorities and adherence to local laws. Please to learn more about our approach in China from LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner. We look forward to welcoming more members in China, which will enable us to better showcase the talent and companies thriving in China to the world - and vice versa. Ultimately, we hope to create economic opportunities for every professional in the world, including matching talented individuals with job and business prospects."},{"post_categories":["Influencers"],"author":"Isabelle Roughol","title":"Best Advice: The Wisdom that Shaped 80+ Influencers [INFOGRAPHIC]","date":"February 25, 2014","content":"When we asked our Influencers to write about the best piece of advice they had ever received, they shared some of their most touching and insightful stories and thousands of you responded with your own.

It brings up feelings of nostalgia for the days when I played on the Softball team. When I think about how much time I used to spend on the field, I am blown away by how different my life is now. While in college, I had an absurd academic and athletic schedule that literally kept me moving from sunrise to well past sunset, including most weekends. Now, in my job at LinkedIn, I have more work-life balance with evenings and weekends to myself. And I get more sleep! Being a student-athlete means taking on a serious time commitment that easily compares to a full-time job, but ironically, I was so busy that it was difficult to find time to gain real work experience. Despite putting half of my efforts into team sports, most collegiate athletes, like myself, end up working behind a desk rather than on top of an Olympic podium. Naturally, it was a little jarring to have the sport I committed so much time to turn into a weekend hobby when I entered the workforce, but I’ve found that the lessons learned on the softball field also carry over to my life as a working professional. My entire college wardrobe consisted of Nike sweatpants and t-shirts. There was no need to wear anything else with my athletic schedule. On game days though, we always looked presentable. My teammates said, “You look good, you feel good; you feel good, you play good; you play good, you win.” Grammar aside, I take this same mentality into the workplace. “Dress for the job you want,” as my manager says. Suits and ties aren’t always necessary – just feel good and play the part. Some of the happiest moments I had on the field were when my teammates succeeded. Typically, we celebrated with high fives and fist bumps. It feels good to be acknowledged like this, so acknowledge others’ accomplishments in the office. Initiate this passion and team spirit -it gets everyone pumped up. (Actual high fives encouraged.) Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “Don't waste your life in doubts and fears: spend yourself on the work before you, well assured that the right performance of this hour's duties will be the best preparation for the hours or ages that follow it.\" In all the hours I committed to softball, the vast majority were related to practice, not games. Glory and excitement come with real competition, but you must treasure the time you have to hone your craft. That preparation and hard work is ultimately how you hit your targets, on the field or in the office. Keep it in and trust that tangible evidence of success will come. Trophy or not. I have boxes overflowing with softball DVDs. There’s game film of opposing pitchers, myself hitting at practice, you name it. My coach always encouraged me to be a “student of the game,” constantly learning more, and I’ve taken this advice to the working world. Study and companies. Study yourself to find things you want to work on. Study trends in your industry. You will be more knowledgeable and productive. Take charge. When a softball is hit between two defenders, you’ll hear a player take control.  She literally yells “mine, mine, mine!” or “I got it!” to let the other player know she’ll make the play. This is “calling the ball,” and there’s a system to it. Sometimes you take it; sometimes someone else does. A player constantly communicates with her teammates and takes initiative to make things happen. The ideal worker communicates with coworkers and seizes opportunities in the same way, only without the yelling. If you spent this much time devoted to a sport, why stop? Just because it’s not your “job” anymore doesn’t mean you can’t stay involved. Sometimes I coach young girls or play catch with a friend. I even do radio broadcasting for the Stanford Softball games. You can keep that fire lit. It will remind you how to light that fire at work. Transitions aren’t always easy. I was worried I wouldn’t be as passionate about any job as I was about softball. With these tips and the , I’m transforming by staying true to my inner athlete and simultaneously welcoming professional development. Mentality is crucial in sports. They even write books about it. (I recommend by Gary Mack for anyone, really.) The key is to translate that mentality and those experiences to further your career and ignite that same passion in a new way."},{"post_categories":["Jobs"],"author":"Samuel Easton","title":"After Graduation, Relationships Are More Important Than Ever","date":"February 20, 2014","content":"When I was growing up, I didn’t pay a lot of attention to the concept of “building relationships.” In high school, my friends were my classmates and teammates, and in college, it seemed like I met people everywhere I went. While attending college, I never really had to think about building and maintaining relationships. They simply came about as a result of living on a college campus surrounded by 30,000 students. However, the working world is not a college campus. The ingredients that lead to lifelong friends at college do not normally exist in a workplace, and I think it’s almost ironic that at a time in your life when relationships have never been more important, they’ve never been harder to build. From what I’ve seen, building relationships early on is the key to kicking off a successful career. Here are a couple of ideas that frame the way I think about building and maintaining relationships in both my professional and personal life, developed from what I’ve learned during my transition into the real world. A variety of studies have shown there is a lot to gain from investing your time in others, whether it be volunteering, donating money or simply helping out a friend (the is a good one to watch). It may seem like building meaningful relationships with those who surround you is a simple concept, but I have found that when I’m not being mindful of it, it’s actually very difficult to do. When I interact with friends, colleagues and strangers, I try to remember that an investment of time now can reap all kinds of rewards later on. Like most things, being thoughtful is where change starts, but only time, dedication and a whole lot of reading (at least for me! Check out , and for a good start) can ensure that I consistently turn my good intentions into actions. Adopting this mindset, I don’t just meet people with the intention of getting something out of them. I try my best to listen to others, pay attention to what is going on in their lives and look for opportunities to solve a problem for them. Even if it’s something as small as surprising a co-worker with coffee when I notice they’re particularly tired, I’ve learned that it is the unexpected moments of generosity that make the biggest impact. Maintaining relationships in the working world is hard work, and creating new ones from scratch is even tougher. The abundance of free time, and people to share it with, that made making friends easy in college is now hard to come by. After graduation, new friends didn’t just show up on my doorstep, and I had to expend a lot of time and energy as I went about building my network of colleagues at work and circle of friends at home. For those of you still in college, this is a great resource as you start thinking about opportunities after graduation. For my fellow professionals, I’m sure you have at one point or another shared with me in the thought that everything was more fun in college. From my new perspective, I would argue that it was simply easier. College was a great time in my life, but now that I’m actually thinking about and investing in my relationships, I’ve never felt more fulfilled."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn for Students"],"author":"Rutha Nuguse","title":"High School Students: Embrace your skills, show your professional side, and create a LinkedIn Profile","date":"February 21, 2014","content":"I was introduced to LinkedIn during my senior year of high school.

As part of the career development training, we were taught the importance of developing a professional brand for ourselves as well as how we could build that brand using the tools LinkedIn provides.

In reality, colleges and universities, and even employers, in the US are not looking for the traditional well-rounded applicant; they’re looking to build well-rounded classes or organizations made up of specialists. One way for applicants to stand out, whether it’s on a college or job application, and develop their interests and skills in a particular field is through internships. Internships are especially important for college students because they provide hands-on experience that will be valuable when it comes time to find a job after graduation. For high school students, it’s an opportunity to explore a field they may want to pursue in college and learn more about what they may want to do in the future. At IvyWise, we advise students to begin looking for internships or that relate to their interests as early as sophomore year. These opportunities don’t have to take up a significant amount of time day-to-day, but students should sustain their involvement over a period of at least 6-8 weeks in order to maximize their time and make an impact. If you’re thinking about getting an internship later this spring or summer, now is the time to start looking. Many companies begin the selection processes for summer internship opportunities for high school or college students in January or February. If you wait too long, your options can be limited. Here’s how to find an internship that’s a great fit for your interests and goals. The point of an internship is to explore a particular field to see if you would like to pursue it as an academic major or career, so you should do something that really interests you and builds upon your current skills. If you’re interested in graphic design, see if local firms are looking for design or administrative interns. If you like biology and medicine, find a local lab that has an opportunity for a research internship. Even if the position isn’t exactly what you imagined, you can still learn about the industry, how the profession works, gain insight into the skills and tools necessary to succeed and begin building your network with professionals in this field. Start your exploration on . When applying for internships, it’s important to have a complete, up-to-date record of your professional experience, interests and goals. Start by filling out your LinkedIn Profile with your professional interests, goals, past jobs or internships, relevant classes or projects, volunteer experience, and upload presentations, videos or photos that best illustrate your accomplishments. By keeping an up-to-date LinkedIn Profile, it will be easier to apply to internships online, either on LinkedIn or directly through the company or organization’s website. Do research on local companies or organizations at which you would like to intern, check out LinkedIn to see if you have any connections who work there, then reach out to learn more about opportunities they may have, or if you have questions about a certain position they have posted. Through , students looking for opportunities in specific fields can connect with alumni and professors who may be able to offer help and guidance in the internship search process. Just like in the college search process, it’s helpful to do your research and talk to as many people as possible in order to learn more about a specific field, company, or internship opportunity. When it comes time to applying for an internship, be sure to provide links to other resources like your personal website, blog, online portfolio, and your updated LinkedIn Profile. You can include these in your resume or in the signature of an email. This way, employers can learn more about you, see some of your work, and gain insight into other accomplishments and interests that you may not have been able to include in your standard resume. So you found a great-fit internship and now they want to interview you. Remember to bring all materials they requested, whether it’s extra copies of your resume (you should have those on-hand anyway), writing or project samples, or a list of references. Dress appropriately and bring a list of your own questions to ask during the interview. This is an opportunity for you to get to know the interviewers and their organization as much as it is a chance for them to get to know you. After the interview, be sure to get business cards in order to send thank you notes and ask additional questions should you have any. Waiting to hear a company’s decision after an interview can be daunting, but no matter the outcome, you are still one step closer to finding a great-fit internship. Rejection can sting, but if you don’t get the position, don’t take it personally. Inquire about why they decided to go in a different direction and use that feedback to assist you in your next search. Standing out from the pool of applicants is key to gaining acceptance to your top-choice university or an offer from your top company. Applicant pools are highly competitive, so it’s important to take advantage of opportunities like internships that can develop your skills and interests. By taking these simple steps to research, network, and build your online presence, you’ll be on your way to finding a great-fit internship."},{"post_categories":["Influencers","Featured","Infographic"],"author":"Ryan Roslansky","title":"The Definitive Professional Publishing Platform","date":"February 19, 2014","content":"We believe in giving our members access to the business knowledge they need to be great at what they do.

Here are some ways to showcase your professional advancements: “When executives have had a progressive career with one organization and continuously take on more responsibility through a long-term employment relationship, it is important to enumerate each position’s achievements and responsibilities separately,” according to , President and Founder of Daley & Associates, a Boston-based recruitment firm. The following example shows how to list each promotion separately, even though each position is with the same employer: This tactic can be particularly helpful for those who have worked for only one employer and need to give a visual impression of movement and progression within that one company. You’ll want to show increased responsibility, expanded project scope, and progressive titles throughout your tenure. If you have had multiple employers where you had multiple promotions, you may want to de-emphasize the visual effect of job hopping, while still showcasing your promotions. In these cases, outline your promotions and title changes  under one company heading. You will minimize the number of times each employer is listed on your profile, while still emphasizing your promotions within those organizations. According to , an experienced healthcare and financial services recruiting expert, “When initially reviewing a LinkedIn Profile, if I see a long list of separate positions, I may not realize some of those positions are with the same employer. My initial visual impression would be that the person moved around a lot in their career. It is only when I take the time to read the profile, which may not happen every time, do I realize the separate entries are actually promotions within one company. Candidates with multiple employers should consolidate promotions within one employer heading, when it makes sense, to minimize the visual first impression of jumping from employer to employer and emphasize progression.” Here is an example of housing promotions at one job under one employer heading, when you have had promotions at more than one employer. This visually reduces the number of employer entries on the LinkedIn Profile:  Effectively positioning promotions on your can make it clear to hiring managers how you moved upward within an organization and not mistakenly have them think you jumped from employer to employer. It will prevent any misunderstandings and misinterpretations of your progressive experience. Most importantly, it will clearly outline to the hiring manager how you assumed additional responsibility and were recognized by your employers for your achievements. In essence, your profile will communicate your accomplishments to a prospective employer before you even hold a conversation, and inspire the recruiter to reach out to learn more. This will help recruiters and hiring managers properly digest your professional experience and reach out to you for an opportunity."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News","Featured","LinkedIn Talent Solutions"],"author":"Parker Barille","title":"Welcome Bright to the LinkedIn Family","date":"February 6, 2014","content":"When we first met and his team at Bright, which we welcomed into the LinkedIn family today, we immediately hit it off.

We are making large, long-term investments on a few big bets, and in order to ensure their success, we need to concentrate on fewer things. Our goal is to provide our members with seamless experiences - not just individual products - that will help them become more productive and successful professionals. With that in mind, we’ve taken a look at our product offerings and made the decision to shut down some services. We are shutting down LinkedIn Intro as of March 7, 2014. last year to bring the power of LinkedIn to your email inbox on your iPhone. While Intro is going away, we will continue to work on bringing the power of LinkedIn to wherever our members work. Email, where the average professional spends more than a quarter of their time, is one of those places, so we’ll continue to look for ways to bring this kind of functionality to our members through existing partnerships. Users of Intro will be able to it between now and March 7 and switch back to their previous mail accounts. Members can continue to use , which brings the power of LinkedIn to Gmail. We are also shutting down , a service that enables SlideShare members to upload presentations with audio, on April 30, 2014. Slidecast users will be able to download their Slidecasts until April 30 and can continue to share the non-audio portions of their presentations with their network on SlideShare.net. The SlideShare team will continue to focus on building new products and improving our existing experiences to make our products even better for our members. We have also decided to eliminate support for the LinkedIn iPad app on iOS versions older than 6.0 as of February 18, 2014. This follows our decision to stop supporting the LinkedIn mobile app for iOS versions older than 6.0 and Android versions older than 3.0 late last year.

When I was in college last year, I thought I knew everything there was to know about the student job search. But now, having spent three months with LinkedIn’s recruitment team, I’ve realized that everything I thought I knew about the job hunt was wrong. Let me explain. Back then, I was like every other student – attending career fairs and applying through online job portals, confident that this was the tried-and-true path to success. After all, it was just so obvious – stand in line, apply, and you’ll get a job. There was just one problem: I never heard back from a single company. But now, having spent time reviewing applications and candidates at a company that’s hiring hundreds of students per year, I understand why some students never hear back. Here’s what I learned – and what you need to know: Why didn’t I hear back? Consider the life of a recruiter: Hundreds of applications come in for every job you post. You can only spend a few minutes (at most!) looking at any given application. And after a while, every application starts to look the same – the same Microsoft Word resume templates, the same jargon (“team player,” “outside-the-box thinker”), and the same generic tone with no indication of their true personality. Considering I did the exact same things, it’s no wonder I never heard back! So what can you do to avoid this trap, to break through the clutter of identical applications? You have to stand out! Here are two ways: Students often assume that they shouldn’t contact recruiters – after all, they’re so busy just reviewing all the applications. But what I’ve learned is that many recruiters and employees are happy to speak with students, especially because this shows serious initiative – a critical characteristic for candidates. Plus, having this conversation transforms you from one of hundreds of anonymous applicants into a unique, interesting candidate.  Creating a stellar LinkedIn profile, website, or blog will not guarantee you a job, but it will build your professional brand. This comes in handy when a recruiter is considering two candidates. Imagine this scenario: You’re a recruiter trying to choose between Candidate A and Candidate B. They both have identical qualifications but Candidate A has a sparse LinkedIn profile, while Candidate B has several recommendations on her profile and a link to a blog that shows off her smarts and sense of humor. Who would you choose? Now, let’s be clear: Standing out is hard work! Both of the above strategies take time and energy. And neither will land you a job overnight. But if you’re feeling frustrated by striking out with the same old tactics, know that there’s a better way – one that actually reflects the way recruiters work. So don’t make the same mistakes I did, step away from the norm, and stand out! Want to know more about how to stand out in the college job hunt?

It’s asking for a raise. People tend to push this off year after year. Either they’re afraid to ask, think one will magically appear or don’t believe they’re entitled to the additional salary. I was recently asked to join the team to help one woman finally ask her boss for her first raise. In preparation, I polled the and received hundreds of responses from professionals who also needed help with this issue. Asking for a raise is like strengthening a muscle -- it's uncomfortable, but you need to build it. It’s important to get comfortable talking about money and exuding confidence. : For starters, do you know how your company makes money? Sounds so simple but can easily answer that question? What is your company's revenue model - is it subscriptions, ad revenue, web traffic, consumers - all of these? If you don't understand how your company makes money, you're not likely to comprehend how your contribution impacts the bottom line. You also need to know what you are doing to make money for your company.  You want to be able to directly attach the work you do to the profitability of the business. Hint: don't fool yourself; everyone has a role in the bottom line. Finally, there’s nothing like figuring out what you're getting paid by the hour to help give you the motivation to ask for that raise or get out. : Don't fool yourself into thinking just because you're not looking for a job you don't need to have an online brand. Fill in your , join industry-based , and start sharing interesting . You want to get yourself noticed long before you go in for the raise conversation and at the very least have a presence for when your boss researches you before you sit down for the raise talk. : This is a critical strategy you need to get your head around and employ if you want to get anywhere in your career and fast. Find a message in your from anyone you work with congratulating you on a job well done (preferably someone who works outside of the company and even more preferably a client) and forward the message to your boss with a “I really enjoy working with ____”, or “Our team did a really great job with the client and thought you'd enjoy their feedback.” Disguise the \"I want you to know I did a good job and you're not going to hear about it unless I tell you\" message you're really sending. There's always the opportunity to take a new course to improve your skills but there's only one that will make a lifelong difference in your career. Sign up for a public speaking course. They're not just for professional public speakers. So often it's not what you say but how you say it and while for this raise conversation you are going to have to deliver the goods, doing so in a confident, clear and controlled manner will make all the difference. Be the early bird that gets the worm. Being one of the first through the door leaves an 'I'm here to work’ impression. You want to have a track record of early entrances /late departures prior to the ask. You want to be in the office when the power brokers are there and you're never going to know if you're the first one out the door and last one in. Become well-versed in your industry by contributing to conversations online and off. In this day and age of electronic media there is no excuse for you to not have a handle on what's going down in your industry so that you can strike up a conversation and/or be able to participate in the water cooler conversation about the trending topics of the day. Check out during your commute to work out the latest industry news. Additionally, follow an industry on LinkedIn so you know the topics that are being discussed at the highest level. After a full month of practicing these tips, it’s time to schedule a sit down with your boss. Remember, you’ll never get a raise if you don’t ask. Stop losing money and start believing that you’re worth more."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Michael \"Dr. Woody\" Woodward, PhD","title":"Why The Right Relationships Matter","date":"February 5, 2014","content":"We all have relationships, it’s a natural part of life. The question is, do we have the relationships? By “right” relationships I’m talking about the ones that add real value to your life. One of the rules of human existence is having to interact with others to get by. Whether on-line or in-person, the people in your network are the ones who influence your attitudes, beliefs, experiences, and ultimately the opportunities that will shape your future. The right opportunities come from being around the right people at the right time. It’s up to you to determine who those right people are and make the time to get in front of them. A quick look at your can tell you quite a bit about the state of your network and whether you really do have the right relationships. If, like most of us, your map is dominated by a really large blob akin to a ball of yarn, you likely don’t have enough of those “right” relationships. This is a phenomenon academics refer to as network homophily. In other words you are connected to too many like-minded people who all know each other. In essence, you’ve created a virtual echo chamber where beliefs and attitudes have likely become stagnant limiting your access to new and unique opportunities If you don’t believe me, ask yourself the following questions: If your answer is ‘yes’ to any of these questions, you may not have enough of those “right” relationships. Consider the following: The greatest hurdle to building a high quality meaningful network is our natural tendency to be drawn to those who are similar to us. Just take a look around. Whether it’s your industry, job, or socioeconomic status, you likely spend most of your time hanging around and communicating with people far more similar to you than different. However comforting this may feel, being around like-minded people rarely leads to new ideas or opportunities. When everyone in your network has roughly the same information, the power of that network becomes greatly diminished. The first step in getting past this innate hurdle is to seek out new doors to open. Finding those right relationships begins with opening your mind to opportunities you may not have previously considered. One way to start opening doors is to change up your routine so as to expose yourself to people who are genuinely different from you, even if it’s within your own company. Over the next week, challenge yourself to sit with someone different at the cafeteria,  reach out to some of your “weak ties” (those you are connected to, but reside outside of your main InMap blob), or strike-up a conversation with someone on the train. Some of my most interesting friends and opportunities have come from chatting up strangers while working at Starbucks! Once you’ve opened your mind and your network, it’s time to start focusing on making those meaningful connections with the right people. In other words, go find the people who are doing what you want to do and immerse yourself in their world. Whether you want to transfer departments, change jobs, or land that promotion, you need to get on the radar of those who matter. These are the decision makers who can help catapult you to new heights.  Don’t be afraid to seek out and crash the conferences, , or Meetups these folks frequent. Again, start by hitting up those weak ties in your network who are connected to the industry influencers you need to meet. Ask them what circles they run in, the trade publications they follow, and professional associations they belong to. It’s all about becoming a player in their game. When I made my first foray into media, I spent a lot of time figuring out ways to penetrate those InMap echo chamber blobs full of TV producers and it started with LinkedIn Groups! Relationships do matter, but we all have a limited amount of time, so focus on building new relationships in those areas that matter most. Creating and nurturing the right relationships can go a long way in opening doors and in some cases, pointing you towards those doors you need to kick down."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News"],"author":"Steve Sordello","title":"LinkedIn’s Q4 2013 Earnings","date":"February 6, 2014","content":"Today, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2013.

You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures at and additional details regarding the use of non-GAAP measures below.  This presentation also contains forward-looking statements about our products, including our investments in products, technology and other key strategic areas, certain non-financial metrics, such as member growth and engagement, and our expected financial metrics such as revenue, adjusted EBITDA, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation for the first quarter of 2014 and the full fiscal year 2014. The achievement of the matters covered by such forward-looking statements involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, the company’s results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements the company makes. The risks and uncertainties referred to above include - but are not limited to - risks associated with: our limited operating history in a new and unproven market; engagement of our members; the price volatility of our Class A common stock; general economic conditions; expectations regarding the return on our strategic investments; execution of our plans and strategies, including with respect to mobile products and features; security measures and the risk that they may not be sufficient to secure our member data adequately or that we are  subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of members to access our solutions; expectations regarding our ability to timely and effectively scale and adapt existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that our  solutions are accessible at all times with short or no perceptible load times; our ability to maintain our rate of revenue growth and manage our expenses and investment plans; our ability to accurately track our key metrics internally; members and customers curtailing or ceasing to use our solutions; our core value of putting members first, which may conflict with the short-term interests of the business; privacy and changes in regulations in the United States, Europe or elsewhere, which could impact our ability to serve our members or curtail our monetization efforts; litigation and regulatory issues; increasing competition; our ability to manage our growth; our ability to recruit and retain our employees; the application of US and international tax laws on our tax structure and any changes to such tax laws; acquisitions we have made or may make in the future; and the dual class structure of our common stock. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company’s financial results is included in filings it makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, as well as the company’s most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2013, and additional information will also be set forth in our Form 10-K that will be filed for the year ended December 31, 2013, which should be read in conjunction with these financial results.  These documents are or will be available on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Relations page of the company's website at http://investors.linkedin.com/.  All information provided in this presentation is as of February 6, 2014, and LinkedIn undertakes no duty to update this information. To supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to competitors' operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates internal comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by including the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company believes that the inclusion of the income tax effects provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from non-GAAP net income. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net income and adjusted EBITDA. As items that impact net income are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net income is not available without unreasonable effort."},{"post_categories":["Privacy","Security"],"author":"Cory Scott","title":"Data Privacy Day: 5 Ways to Protect Your LinkedIn Account","date":"January 28, 2014","content":"At LinkedIn, our members always come first.

Two-step verification requires a person to use more than one form of verification to access an account, usually by \"knowing something\" such as a password and by \"having something\" such as a mobile device. Two-step verification is a much stronger form of account protection that can greatly reduce identity theft and unauthorized access to sensitive information since most accounts become compromised from new or unknown computers or devices. LinkedIn offers members the ability to turn on two-step verification for their accounts, which will require an account password and a numeric code sent to your phone via SMS whenever we don't recognize the new device you're attempting to sign in from. Check out our to learn more about two-step verification or check out our . A good indicator of a protected connection on a website is a connection.

Professional goals become more attainable when you’re able to connect and collaborate with others who can help you achieve them. Finding the best path to meeting these key contacts can be daunting though. Today, we’re introducing a new “How You’re Connected” tool on LinkedIn profiles that aims to make that process much easier by helping you find the best path or strongest commonalities shared between you and the individual that could be the key to obtaining your next success.

So let’s say you’re an advertising professional looking for an introduction to the CMO of a company you’d love to do business with. You might find one mutual connection attended school with her before she kick started her career but another worked with her recently on a very high-profile campaign.

We only provide data when we believe that we’re legally required to do so, unless it’s a rare emergency situation, and we carefully scrutinize and evaluate each request. We take steps to let members know before we turn over their data, unless we’re legally prohibited from doing so or the request is an emergency. We’re also as open as possible about government requests for member data. This is why, since 2011, we’ve published every six months. The Transparency Reports tell our members and the LinkedIn community how many requests for member data we receive from governments around the world, the number of member accounts impacted, and the percentage of requests we respond to. Our Transparency Reports have not included data about requests related to U.S. national security-related matters because the U.S. government has prohibited us from releasing this data in a meaningful way.

In between the hugs and kisses, football games, and copious amounts of food during the holiday season, I managed to steal away a few minutes for myself. I began to think about how much my idea of  “home” has shaped my value system. My family hails from Trinidad, where culture and values are deeply intertwined. I’ve found the same to be true here at LinkedIn. Those values and what they taught me were an integral part of how I actually landed my first job out of college. Maybe you’re entering the spring semester of your senior year with no idea what’s coming next. Or perhaps you just graduated and are trying to steer your career in the right direction. Wherever you find yourself, know that you are not the only one. I’ve been there, and want you to learn from some of my experiences so that mistakes which can be avoided are. Here are three insights from my personal experience that just might help you clear through the fog when it comes to picking your first job. I wasted large portions of my senior year of college not being honest about what I wanted. I saw what my friends were doing, and tried to emulate. But when I started being truthful about what I wanted out of a career and a company, the fog started to lift. I wanted a place where I would be challenged and forced to adapt. Where ideas could be nurtured and grown, even if the end result seems impossible. It is an uncomfortable process, but when you’re truthful with yourself, the results are liberating. Part of the reason I came to LinkedIn was due to how effectively  people’s natural talents are being utilized. I saw growth happening in real time, and it was celebrated and actively supported regardless of function. One of my mentors during college, , was the reason I came to LinkedIn. His career has transformed in 2 years, and the impact he has grown to have has been exponential. What made it even more impactful was that he reached out to share his success with me. He sold me on LinkedIn because our relationship mattered, more than anything else. That showed me that LinkedIn was a place that shared that value, which made my decision to come here much easier. I knew I was joining a place where my colleagues are the best at what they do, our leadership team dreams big, and I am never the smartest person in the room. I have Troy to thank for showing me that. I knew that if I moved to California, I had to be certain about two things: who I was, and what I stood for. If I had any doubts about how the company I work for does business and the reason behind it, then I did not want my name to be a part of it. Both of those things came together at LinkedIn, and the results have been remarkable. If you decide what your non-negotiables are and stand firmly by them, you can find a clearer path to where you want to go and how to get there. It’s almost never linear, but straight lines are less fun anyway. Most of my close friends and family know I work at LinkedIn, but don’t know much else. I can show them better than I can tell them, so they will all just . What they do know is that there is no question about my integrity when I come to work everyday. I have them to thank for showing me how to live with conviction, lead by example, and practice humility daily. That’s the beauty of culture and values: you can bring them wherever you go."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Speaker Series"],"author":"Brett Wallace","title":"Lessons From Great Storytellers: LinkedIn Speaker Series with Nancy Duarte","date":"January 10, 2014","content":"Great ideas can change the world. But, they can only do so when effectively communicated. A powerful story is one of the best ways we can share our world-changing ideas. From cave paintings dating back to 15,000 BC to the next hit movie, stories fascinate us. They draw us in, move us and inspire us to act. Whether you’re on the frontline engaging customers or a manager inspiring your team at a kickoff meeting, becoming a better storyteller will help you become a more effective business professional. Recently, we welcomed , a renowned storytelling expert and LinkedIn Influencer, to participate in the . Nancy has created some in the storytelling industry by understanding what makes great stories great, including her work alongside Al Gore for the documentary slideshow An Inconvenient Truth. Based on her talk at LinkedIn, here are three simple lessons that will help you become a better storyteller. The shape of great communication follows a simple 3 act structure – beginning, middle and end. And, it has an undulating structure moving back and forth from what is to what could be, ending with a new bliss. Act 1 - The beginning of the story establishes the status quo (“what is”) and establishes your credibility with the audience. It then introduces the future state (“what could be”) uses drawing an identifiable distinction of the gap between what is and what could be. Act 2 - The middle of the speech moves back and forth contrasting “what is” vs. “what could be”. This contrast makes the status quo and normal unappealing and draws the audience towards an alluring future. Act 3 - In the end, communicate how amazing the  future will be with your idea adopted (note – the audience remembers the ending more than any other part). Great storytellers send signals that resonate with their audience. They talk to audiences at their resonant frequency in a way that moves them. And they make the audience their hero with the goal to move their audience from one state to another through the power of story. Steve Jobs used a heightened sense of “what could be”. In his infamous iPhone launch speech, delivered in 2007, he marveled at his own products. When speaking about iTunes, he pronounced, “now, we are selling over 5 million songs a day now. Isn’t that unbelievable?\" He models the behavior he wants his audience to see. Dr. King captured the moment. Dr. King’s captivating speech, “I Have a Dream”, was delivered in 1963 from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington DC. Dr. King moved rapidly between “what is” and “what could be” to capture the energy of that day. He uses repetition often with “I have a dream” and concludes repeating the new bliss through powerful phrases repeating, “Let Freedom ring”. And, he draws from several political sources such as the “the United States Constitution” and “The Emancipation Proclamation”. The above examples of great storyteller were touched on during Nancy’s talk at LinkedIn, and . Great storytellers take a step back from their current reality. They declare the future using their prophetic imagination, and craft their words well. Their speeches are expansive and also contemplative, giving their audiences space to dream.

I get a rush from it. And, I enjoy getting other people to try things they never thought they would try. It’s in my DNA. The first years of my professional life were spent developing and nurturing a very successful career in sales. I worked for software and technology companies that were creating revolutionary tools that paved the way for the speech and handwriting recognition tools that we are accustomed to using today. As part of my job, I was able to help well-known brands adapt to and leverage these new tools before they became commonplace – it was an adventure in itself for me. But, as time went on, I found myself craving something new and challenging – I was ready for a change. So I made the decision to take a short break from my corporate life and go for a motorcycle ride through South America. My plan was to ride for a year – and, when I got back, begin looking for my next adventure. I had some money in savings, a rough plan to finance this exploration and the desire to experience something new. What did I have to lose? Over the next year, I motorcycled through 18 countries, ending in Buenos Aires, Argentina. When the year was up, I unexpectedly found myself deeply in love with South America – Ecuador in particular – and I wasn’t ready to leave. Yet, through a series of unexpected events, I also knew at this point that my financial plan wasn’t going to pan out the way I anticipated. I had to make a decision, I a source of income, but I to stay. What could I do? My priorities had shifted, and I found myself craving a different kind of fulfillment, something I knew I wouldn’t find in the corporate world. I wanted to do something positive – something that would bring happiness and pleasure to people in the way that the experience of the past year had done for me. So in 2009, a close friend and I started , a first-class motorcycle adventure touring company intended to make it easier for people to do what I had done – feel the absolute freedom of being on a motorcycle in Latin America. It wasn’t an easy shift, but over the past 4+ years we’ve been able to tap into our networks to help grow our business, while also leveraging a combination of platforms to build our customer base: word of mouth, our website and of course, social media -- including LinkedIn. I frequently get asked for my advice by others looking to make a transformative move in their own careers and lives, so I’ve pulled together a few simple rules to live by that helped me make the leap.

A young architect who lives nearby had just made a New Year’s resolution to join a nonprofit board. In an earlier era, they would not have known each other existed. But in this instance the shelter’s executive director used LinkedIn to contact the architect – and the architect jumped at the opportunity to serve on the shelter’s board. The connection – the nonprofit shelter got the expertise it needed and the young architect was able to amplify her social impact while broadening her professional skills. This story inspired me and my colleagues at LinkedIn. As someone who studies and invests (as a venture capitalist) in internet marketplaces, I realized the somewhat serendipitous connection between architect and shelter would happen more often if there were a dedicated volunteer marketplace. After all, there are hundreds of thousands of “nonprofit needs” in the world, and even more professionals who want to donate their skills to help meet these needs. The challenge is that nonprofits and professionals don’t know how to easily find each other. aims to solve that problem. When I talk with LinkedIn members, many tell me they aren’t actively looking for traditional job opportunities. Instead, they want to hone or leverage their skills while also making a positive impact on the world. Students often fall into this category. Retired professionals and stay-at-home parents seek ways to continue to leverage their skills and experience. And while busy professionals who love their current gigs may not necessarily be looking for a new position, these are often the very people who are most actively engaged in “meaningful searches” – a volunteer opportunity that will enhance their life in ways beyond what their primary vocation provides. By providing opportunities for all these different kinds of LinkedIn members, we aim to help the social sector by doing what we do best as a company: connecting talent with opportunity at massive scale. And to ensure that the volunteer opportunities you see in the are high quality, we’re partnering with the most trusted organizations in this space, including ,  and . Talent is as critical to the nonprofit sector as it is to the for-profit sector. Estimates suggest that approximately two million board seats need to be filled each year and according to a Taproot Foundation study, 92% of nonprofits would like to use skilled volunteers to help them achieve their mission. To date, more than three million LinkedIn members have added the to their profile. Over the last six months alone, more than 600,000 have . Today, with the launch of LinkedIn Volunteer Marketplace, non-profits can discover the relevant members who’ve expressed interest in volunteering. In addition, these members will now be able to browse hundreds – and eventually thousands – of specific, high-quality volunteer opportunities that nonprofits are seeking to fill. Volunteering is a great way to hone your existing skills, develop new professional skills, and network with like-minded colleagues. In a recent survey on LinkedIn, 42% of hiring managers stated they consider volunteer work equivalent to full-time work experience. 20% said they’d hired someone because of their volunteer experience. LinkedIn’s vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. Jeff and I have discussed this vision in terms of the development of , i.e. a complete digital representation of the global economy, including all full-time, part-time, and volunteer opportunities. By incorporating volunteer opportunities into the Economic Graph, the right talent will be more likely to find the right non-profit opportunities, which we think is key to solving some of the world’s great challenges. We know that many professionals have already added volunteering to their New Year’s resolution list. With the launch of , we’d like to help you keep that promise to yourself. Here’s to a personally and professionally rewarding 2014!"},{"post_categories":[],"author":"Laura Labovich","title":"The How-To Guide for Meeting Your Career-Focused New Year’s Resolutions","date":"January 16, 2014","content":"We’re halfway through January, and there are already 948 million search results for the term “New Years Resolutions for 2014.” I think it’s safe to say that more than a few people have added “Get a New Job” to their list of new year’s resolutions. According to Dan Sullivan, founder and CEO of , in order to be profoundly successful you always need to increase your confidence, something long-term job seekers often find waning. It was once believed that confidence was innate—you were either born with it or you were not—but Sullivan adamantly denies that assertion. In order to be more confident, he says, you must continuously improve your knowledge, attitude, skills and habits, or your KASH. And who doesn’t want more KASH in the New Year? Here’s how to get some: Just because you’re no longer in school doesn’t mean you should stop learning. Increasingly viewed as a burgeoning way to share information, online courses are quickly becoming the “knowledgemobile” of the future. Taking a new course, or earning a certification can be an essential first step for career changers and those returning to the workforce. Certifications, in particular, enable you to quickly amass both industry and function-specific knowledge that can fill a gap left by a previous exit from the workforce, an employment history that no longer supports your goals, or a blind spot in a four-year degree program. According to , CEO of Burning Glass, “In an increasingly competitive labor market, employers want new hires to come to the job with the skills to be successful from day one. Job seekers are well served to target the specific skills for which employers are looking, and use certification programs, online courses and other training programs to develop, refine, and demonstrate those skills to prospective employers.” Premier online education companies such as Coursera, Udacity, and Pearson offer a whole slew of options, from songwriting to chemistry to sustainable agriculture land management, and pretty much everything in between. You might not get a free degree out of the deal, but these courses can offer insight into a new field or refine skills that may be a bit rusty. And committing to one shows potential employers that you have the wherewithal to not just seek out online courses but to actually finish them. ( Boasting 14K+ members, the LinkedIn is for “optimistic people who believe in the power of positive thinking and concentrate on the good rather than the bad.” According to , “When the chips are down, and they often are, attitude is the secret sauce.” But when you’re smack dab in the middle of a frustrating job search, generating positivity isn’t as easy as it looks. Zig Ziglar once said: “You can have anything you want in this life if you help enough other people get what they want,” and experts agree: being generous is a powerful strategy for success. In his book , shares why some people “rise to the top while others sink to the bottom.” His answer, not surprisingly, is striking a . To generate positivity, start by generating generosity (which, by the way, is easier to do than it is to say). Look inward at what you have to offer to others, separate and apart from your professional skills, and practice shifting your mindset from “what can I get out of this conversation?” to “what am I going to give?” If you come up short, borrow some of our ideas until you can think of something! Offer to mentor an industry newbie, refer a friend to a job for which you are not a fit, or inquire about the New Years Resolutions of others—then find an article of interest and share it. They will remember—and thank—you for it! Turns out, your mother was right: practice does in fact make perfect. If you find yourself with time on your hands, skills-based volunteering is a fantastic way to keep your skills fresh and remain on the cutting edge of your profession. And, let’s not forget: when done correctly, volunteering gets you into the same room with your target decision-makers. And, with the launch of LinkedIn’s new , finding right-fit opportunities could not be easier. It worked like a charm for Sophia, a passionate environmentalist and eager return-to-work mom in Washington D.C., who offered her marketing expertise to EcoWomen, a local women’s environmental association practically in her backyard. In less than two months, she was offered a marketing manager job by a fellow member and touted: “volunteering was better than getting a college degree.” Tracking your search activities enables you to witness ongoing progress, increase your momentum, and stay motivated during those moments when hope is in short supply. Below are just a few activities you could track to show you that you are, in fact, getting somewhere. Bottom line: this year, by focusing on increasing your knowledge, attitude, skills and habits, you will improve your KASH and your job search along with it."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn for Good"],"author":"Ariana Younai","title":"Announcing LinkedIn Innovation & Transformation Grant Winners 2013 [SLIDESHOW]","date":"December 19, 2013","content":"At LinkedIn, we encourage our employees to take intelligent risks and to pursue opportunities that will transform themselves, the company and the world.

In addition to bringing in (even modest) extra income, they help us learn new skills, make new connections, and discover the true value of what we have to offer the world. When I launched my own side-business of selling on the handmade marketplace Etsy, I hoped for little more than selling a few copies so fund my own gift purchases on the site. Instead, I ended up creating workbooks that have now helped hundreds of people organize their finances, finding a new community, and working on some of the most satisfying projects of my career. As with many other side-giggers, my entrepreneurial venture actually contributes to my full-time job. I’ve learned new online marketing, design, social media and technical skills that I can now apply to my primary job as a writer and editor. With those kinds of benefits, it’s no wonder that the that one in three millennials have launched side-businesses.

The fastest way to create a financial catastrophe is to create a conflict with your full-time job: Working on your side-business on company time, stealing clients, or working for competitors are all big no-nos, but so are subtler ethical violations.

There's something satisfying about the start of a new year, and with it, the promises we make to lose weight, get organized and spend more time with the people we love. It's a moment when even our most ambitious goals seem achievable. So what's the right way to make, and keep, those New Year's resolutions? To find out, I turned to our Influencers, the business luminaries and authors who blog regularly on LinkedIn. This is a group of impossibly accomplished people who know how to develop a plan and stick to it. So what do they have to say about self improvement in 2014? Over the past few days, they've enlightened readers with personal stories of weight loss (Likeable Media's Dave Kerpen ; my colleague, John C Abell, ).

Much of their wisdom is practical -- , for example -- and designed to help professionals who may have stumbled in years past. If you're looking to make a change in 2014, here are a few of their top strategies: Before committing to a resolution, take time to . Ask, \" \" The question could lead you to give something up (less nagging of your spouse) or to take something on (more volunteering, more movie nights with friends), says Gretchen Rubin, the author of By thinking about your goal, and asking a series of questions, you'll be more likely to accomplish what you want, Deep Nishar, LinkedIn's senior vice president of products and user experience.

Answering those questions will also help you to -- a resolution RadiumOne CEO Gurbaksh Chahal professionals to make. OK, sure, it's admirable that you want to write the Great American Novel, travel to the Himalayas and volunteer every weekend. But are you being realistic? Sometimes the best resolutions aren't the big, world-changing goals, but the . Like eating dinner with your family. Brad Keywell, a Chicago-based entrepreneur and a co-founder of Groupon, says every night could have a profound effect. \"Cooking dinner at home will help you stay healthy and improve your relationships,\" he . \"You’ll be able to check off most of the people have each year, all with this one resolution.\" Richard Moran goes even simpler: The venture capitalist and CEO points out that most of us have our heads buried in our smartphones in meetings, in the bathroom, at restaurants and even during romantic dinners.

These “small service resolutions,\" as she calls them, are meaningful -- and also easy to keep. Of course, many resolutions fail: We get busy, our priorities shift and somehow all the goals we jotted down at the beginning of the year no longer seem doable. It doesn't have to be that way. The key to lasting change is not only picking the right resolution, but also , says Charles Duhigg, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for and the author of Duhigg last week described a to habit formation that can help people in the new year. \"First, choose a cue, like leaving your running shoes by the door, then pick a reward — say, a piece of chocolate when you get home from the gym,\" he . \"Eventually, when you see the shoes, your brain will start craving the reward, which will make it easier to work out day after day.\" Another important point, Influencers , is that the resolution needs to be specific, and measurable. Saying you want to find more joy in your life is hard to quantify. But pledging to \"'distract myself with fun music when I’m feeling gloomy,' 'watch at least one movie each week,' 'buy a plant for my desk' are resolutions that will carry you toward those abstract goals,\" Rubin .

For job seekers who may be nervous about networking during the holidays, remember that giving to your network is one of the best ways to maintain relationships, establish trust and stay top of mind as the year comes to an end. , and there is no better place to do so than on LinkedIn. Here is my 2013 LinkedIn Holiday Giving Guide: Have you learned something new this year from your involvement in a ? Perhaps a specific member answered one of your questions or the Group Managers always make sure to spark interesting discussion? Post a Discussion in the Group to say thank you to everyone who fueled your passion this year. LinkedIn’s research shows that members who participate in groups receive four times the number of average profile views. You can also now see your group contribution level on the right-hand side of your screen inside every group. If you’re not comfortable posting publicly, you can send a private message to the Group’s Managers to say thank you for creating and maintaining the community. You can find out who the managers are by clicking on the “i” in the header bar at the top of any Group’s page. Here’s an example of what to say: I strongly recommend you follow , and relevant to you and your search. This will keep you informed about all of the latest updates from potential employers and your overall industry. You should also be following the news of the people in your network; it’s just as important. During December—and throughout the rest of the year—challenge yourself to comment on a few contacts’ status updates every time you log onto LinkedIn. For example, if one of your connections uploaded a a recently completed project, take the time to view that content and then post a comment mentioning what you liked about the work. Or, if you notice that a former classmate or colleague received a promotion or started a new course of study, congratulate the person on taking new steps to advance his career and offer your support. Another way to spread the cheer on LinkedIn is through LinkedIn’s top “giving” features: and . Both of these allow you to directly help someone else, vouching for that person’s skills and abilities. This month, honestly endorse the Skills & Expertise of a few of your connections each day. While many people do tend to return the favor, it’s best to give endorsements or recommendations with no goal other than to help someone else. If people do endorse you in return, then a thank you is warranted and always appreciated. When it comes to Recommendations, recruiters tell me that they are most impressed by specific praise. For example, rather than writing a generic “Gerald was a great team player” note, try to mention something specific this person did to make your team successful or a moment the person truly went above and beyond. This only takes a few extra minutes on your part, but could make a world of difference to the recipient, particularly if he or she is a fellow job seeker. Millions of people volunteer their time, especially during the holiday season, to support causes that matter to them. For a job seeker, these activities can be doubly meaningful: you can advance the goals of your favorite non-profit organization and also build skills that matter to your career. Often-cited research by LinkedIn has shown that , so don’t forget to mention your volunteer efforts on your LinkedIn profile by . As a bonus, when you update your profile with this information, your network will see that you’ve been working with your chosen nonprofit and may take the opportunity to learn more about that organization’s good works. During this holiday season, build and strengthen your network in the most feel-good way possible: in the spirit of giving.

While Santa Claus is busy making a list and checking it twice, we’ve been busy here at LinkedIn learning about the many talents of Santa Clauses around the world – from the French Père Noël to the German Weihnachtsmann. After looking through nearly 1,000 LinkedIn Profiles globally, we’ve got some fun findings to share with you. Let’s start with Santa’s title, which comes with an array of professional talents. Take a look at the infographic and you’ll see Santas are carpenters, cooks, scientists, and even actors (Shh, don’t tell the kids!). Like in any other career, there are different levels to being a professional Santa – from managers and directors, to real Santas and bearded Santas (We have yet to see a non-bearded Santa…). Now let’s look at the skills and experience it takes to be a professional Santa. It turns out professional Santas are pros at Marketing Events Management, TV and Video Production, as well as Theater and Drama. We’ve even found some Santas who’ve had experience as politicians, which probably comes in handy. After all, it likely takes some political savvy to mobilize a team of reindeer across hundreds of countries around the world. So where do all these Santas live? If you’re thinking they’re all at the North Pole, that’s just a myth. Santas live on every continent: From the Americas to Russia, from Sweden to South Africa – Santa is everywhere. If you’re sending a last-minute letter to this jolly gift giver, you may want to re-route it. Santa may be known for one particular red fuzzy hat, but we’ve learned from our data research he wears many. And, even Santa knows to keep his LinkedIn Profile up to date with all the skills and experience that make him great…wherever in the world he may be."},{"post_categories":["International","Asia Pacific"],"author":"Cliff Rosenberg","title":"LinkedIn is Now in Thai","date":"December 17, 2013","content":"I am pleased to announce that LinkedIn is now available in Thai!

The Lesson: It’s about the team. Not just sometimes. . As you think about how you can create leverage in your company, your community, your family, and personally in 2014, think about the team you are building, what winning means, and how you are going to get there. Here are 5 guiding principles that were critical to ensuring that the LinkedIn team finished as the ( ) by raising $250,000 in just 4 weeks, and in doing so, created a lasting impact on men’s health. Your fan base is your employees and their social networks. Before you launch any effort, figure out who you want to support this initiative, and get them fired up. Our fan base grew as our coaches implemented “plays” like a chili cook-off, karaoke and beer night, and a pie eating contest.  We even auctioned off the “design” of some Mobro’s moustaches to the highest bidder. Word got out. Our fans fell in love with the team and cheered, then donated. Executive sponsorship is critical to create groundswell internally. We successfully recruited global and local executive leadership and focused heavily on recruiting our Mo-sistas, in what had been a predominantly male team in previous years. One key LinkedIn executive, who was personally impacted by prostate cancer, pledged on a global video conference hosted by our CEO to “match” whatever we raised. The race was on and we leveraged his pledge as our collective inspiration and motivation. Find and woo a sponsor or two, then amplify their support across the organization. Sometimes the stadium is part of the draw. Great football teams don’t have a great head coach. They have amazing defensive coaches, special teams coaches, and management. We took everyone who expressed interest to task and asked for their help. We had fundraising drives, brewed and sold beer, traded donations internally, traded donations externally. We asked our technology team to post notices on internal company networks. Each office had at least one lead, and each lead leveraged their network to hang posters, talk about Movember in meetings, and motivate their teammates and colleagues. Our coaches communicated weekly on a global basis and shared best practices. We were on the field for 4 weeks, and analyzing the heck out of every play. Build your team of coaches first, then give them the autonomy to help their “teams” shine. Urgency doesn’t exist unless someone articulates the “why.”    The clock runs out in most charity events. The first “clock” to focus on is the start date. Warming up your potential fan base of donors is a critical first step. We set a goal of raising $200,000 to double . We shared this across the organization, and ensured that we maximized the number of registered Mobro’s and Mosista’s across all locations. The second “clock” is the event end date. We had an incredibly short November with the odd placement of the Thanksgiving holiday, so we provided weekly updates and pushes to our global team, tracking progress, and how much time was left. This instilled a sense of urgency that translated to Thanksgiving weekend becoming our final and most successful push for donations across the entire event. By the end of Movember, more than 500 LinkedIn employees joined the cause. Bookend your event with deliberate urgency. Celebrating your champions publicly is critically important during a charity event. We tracked leaders across the four week period, recognized our top Mosista’s and Mobro’s, and publicly thanked them for their hard work. They, in turn, helped us spread the word about our success internally at LinkedIn. As a result of this groundswell, our employees continued to sign up right through the end of the event, if just to collect $20 from a family member. We are still dancing, and donations are still coming in. If you’re inspired to donate to our cause, . Next Play? $500,000 in 2014.

You’d love to be a success and take home the kind of sweet paycheck that comes with it. But though you’ve made headway in your career, that big goal keeps eluding you. How do I this? Because the title of this piece clearly hit a nerve with you and made you keep reading. But just because you haven’t yet nailed the killer title and paycheck, it doesn’t mean they’re out of your grasp. The fact that you’re on LinkedIn means you’re in the game and ready to do what’s necessary to succeed.  But you may be going about it the wrong way. In my experience managing hundreds of people over the years, I’ve seen many fail to get ahead not because they lacked talent and/or drive, but because they followed the wrong game plan. When career experts talk about getting ahead, they usually offer very earnest-sounding advice: work hard, pay your dues and keep your eye on the ball. But workplaces are often scrappy environments and to thrive you must be fearless, shrewd, and even willing to break some of the rules. That means at times thinking more like Katniss Everdeen in Hunger Games than Sheryl Sandberg. Here’s what you may have wrong—and how to tap into your inner Katniss to get what you deserve. . Yes, you need to determine your boss’s expectations and then deliver on them. But if you really want to separate yourself from the pack and move up, you need to do far than you’ve been told. You have to come up with bold, innovative ideas—and/or big bold solutions--that no one’s ever asked you for. Remember that scene in the first Hunger Games when Katniss can’t get the judges’ attention even though she hits a bullseye with her bow and arrow? So what does she do? She brazenly shoots an arrow through the apple in the stuffed pig they are about to eat. THAT not only gets their attention but earns her a top score. So how do you innovate? your thinking. Dare to wonder, “What if…?” With every project ask yourself the three B’s. Could it be better, bigger, bolder? Great ideas generally involve some rule bending or breaking, but the right company will reward you for it. Yes, you need to focus on the ball. But you also have to pay attention to the people kicking or batting it around (or in Katniss’ case, the ones out for blood). Your co-workers’ needs and behavior can seriously affect you. With your boss, really listen—to what he says as well as what’s between the lines. Is he suddenly cool? Then set up a time to talk and review your work. Don’t rationalize criticism. Learn from it. With co-workers, be aware that when they’re interacting with you, they almost have an agenda. Are they trolling for info? Be careful about what you reveal (when someone tells you, “It’s in the vault, don’t believe them.”) Could they be trying to muscle in on your territory? Call them on it or they will do it again—and worse the next time. You’ve heard it plenty of times by now. The squeaky wheel definitely gets the grease. But asking is most effective if you first do what a successful woman I know calls the . That’s where you lay the foundation so when it’s time to ask, the other person doesn't feel caught off guard--or slightly used. Let’s say you want to ask a powerful person you met to introduce you to a key player she knows. She’ll be more receptive if you’ve been in touch since you met, for instance, sending her a link to an article she’d find interesting or mentioning her on LinkedIn complimenting her on a story she was quoted in. Or let’s say it’s six months to raise time. Don’t just plan to ambush your boss right beforehand and ask her for more money. Spend the next months knocking it out of the park in a demonstrable way (a 15% increase in sales, for instance). And regularly share progress reports with your boss. . Good. But who you meet at industry events is often so random Be more in your networking.  Follow people’s career moves and accomplishments on LinkedIn and then send them an inMail. The pre-ask can work well here, too. Case in point: a woman I know contacted people she found through LinkedIn Advanced Search who had played in the same athletic conference that she’d been involved in during college AND who worked for companies she was interested in. First she established a dialogue over their shared experiences. Later, she made her pitch. When you network in person, it’s good to have a your “elevator pitch ready,” but it’s also important to . What are the other person’s needs and interests? This may sound counter-intuitive, but sometimes it’s better to talk when you’re networking. It’s important to know how to work effectively with other people. But don’t go into overdrive trying to make people you. From what I’ve seen, 15 percent of people in your workplace won’t like you no matter what you do (you may remind them of the sister who cut their Barbie’s hair off with nail clippers or something like that). Secondly, being a huge people pleaser sucks up a lot of energy and can make you seem needy. Aim to win people’s respect (and their envy!) and let someone else go for the Miss Congeniality award. Nod less, smile less. When you give a task to your subordinate, don’t say, “Can you please do this?” Say “Here’s a project I need you to take care of; it should be completed by Thursday morning.” And don’t wait to see if she wrinkles her nose. . Feeling passionate about your work helps guarantee you’ll be a success at it. But when you’re at a job is often when it’s time to move on. That’s because you’re probably not being challenged anymore. Don’t allow yourself to get comfy. Do the math. What’s the average amount of time a star in your field stays in your type of position? It’s probably time to think about a bold new challenge that will, for a while, at least, scare the pants off you. But guess what? It will pay a lot better! Taking risks is scary but it gets easier, and you end up even more emboldened by your victories. I guess I should end by saying, “May the odds be ever in your favor.” Photo Credit: Flickr/"},{"post_categories":["Product News","Featured","New LinkedIn Features"],"author":"Johnathan Podemsky","title":"Introducing A New Way to Search for Influencer Content on LinkedIn [SLIDESHOW]","date":"December 16, 2013","content":"Ever wish you could quickly and easily find all the Influencer posts on LinkedIn about social media, education or maybe finance?

ECPA is a 30-year old law that is an outdated patchwork of confusing standards allowing U.S. law enforcement access to personal information held by technology companies. As I previously shared in on ECPA and related issues, as a matter of principle, we think it is critical that the U.S. government - while preserving the tools it needs to protect the public – ensure that its laws take into account changes in technology. LinkedIn has long held that the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution should apply to all data, whether stored in analog or digital format. For instance, the U.S. government is required to obtain a search warrant before accessing physical documents like a rolodex of your contacts stored on your desk or in a file cabinet, but under ECPA today, not for accessing your rolodex of contacts stored in the cloud. We believe the same standard should apply to both, regardless of the storage format. Likewise, we believe that a search warrant is necessary for access to electronic communications (e.g., email), regardless of whether the communication is 179 days old or 181 days old – but under ECPA today, an arbitrary line is drawn at emails stored for 180 days. It makes no sense that the technological advancement of our society should reduce the protections guaranteed under the Fourth Amendment. Based on this U.S. constitutional principle, we hold the government to the higher standard and require it to obtain a search warrant for access to a member’s connections, and for the content of communications, regardless of how long they have been stored. The changes advocated by the Digital Due Process Coalition rationalize, simplify, and clarify the standards for U.S. government law enforcement access to data, and provide clearer privacy protections for our members and internet users, taking into account changes in technology, while preserving the legal tools necessary for the government to enforce the laws and protect the public. The Coalition also does not support special rules for regulatory agencies, which are advocating for Congress when enacting ECPA reform to make exceptions for them so that they can gain access to emails and other content without a search warrant. LinkedIn has consistently supported ECPA reform, so we wholeheartedly support this , as well as the other efforts to reform ECPA. We urge you to join the effort to bring greater legal protections under the law for LinkedIn members and users of electronic services in the U.S. The magic number for this petition is 100,000 votes, and we are almost there. The deadline for signing the petition is Thursday, December 12, 2013."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Christine Choi","title":"Top 10 Overused LinkedIn Profile Buzzwords of 2013 [INFOGRAPHIC]","date":"December 11, 2013","content":"As 2013 comes to a close, we revisit our analysis of overused buzzwords in members’ profiles for the fourth year in a row. Does ‘creative’ once again dominate as it has for the past two years? Or will we see some surprising changes? Since we last did this study, LinkedIn’s member base grew from 187 million to more than 259 million members worldwide. Drawing from English-language LinkedIn profiles around the globe, here’s what we found: this year, ‘responsible’ landed solidly at number one.  It was used more than twice as often as the number two buzzword, ‘strategic’.  In addition, of the top buzzwords from 2012 only four make the list in 2013: ‘creative’, ‘responsible’, ‘effective’, ‘analytical’. Some words from last year that didn’t make the cut this year are: ‘experimental’, ‘motivated’, ‘multinational’, ‘specialized’. With these English-language profiles worldwide, we also looked at profiles in a selection of countries*.  Surprisingly, most of the countries had the same top three buzzwords, in the same order: ‘responsible’, ‘strategic’, ‘effective’. Despite the similarities, we found some notable outliers: ‘sustainable’ was in top ten in only the Netherlands; ‘enthusiastic’ only in Great Britain. Geographical neighbors Australia and New Zealand were the only countries to feature ‘passionate’ in their respective top ten lists. The buzzword ‘patient’ ranks number five worldwide, but it was featured in the top ten for only the United States in the country breakout. So how did it make the top ten around the globe?  Looking at the numbers, we found that US profiles alone made up 50% of the usage of the word. How will you stand out from other professionals in 2014? Your LinkedIn profile is your professional brand, so make it count.

This has prompted college and universities to use social media as an informative recruitment tool, with (up from 37% 10 years ago), according to the National Association for College Admissions Counseling. Considering these statistics, it’s no wonder there’s been a major development of online resources for students to connect with prospective schools, and vice versa. With social offerings like , students are more connected than ever and are able to make more informed decisions about where to apply. However, students will be wise to note that this connectivity goes both ways and to use social media with that in mind. found that 29% of admissions officers surveyed have used Google to search for an applicant (up from 27% last year), and 31% visited an applicant’s Facebook or other social media profile (up from 26% in 2012). Of those, 30% reported finding something online that negatively impacted a student’s admissions chances. This has sent many students and parents into a panic, wondering what exactly constitutes negative behavior online, and where the boundaries lie in terms of what will be considered in the college admissions process. Unfortunately, some students have learned hard lessons about how their online presence . While college admissions officers may not look you up online, the increasing chance they will is reason enough to be mindful. Here are some tips for students to be social media savvy: Social media sites are considered “public,” but that doesn’t mean everyone has to see what you’re posting. Make sure social media profiles are private, or limit posts so only friends can see them. Many sites change their privacy settings often, so it’s wise to check them frequently. On LinkedIn, users under 18 have that prevent profiles from turning up in public searches and limit the information that users who are not connections can see. Strengthening privacy settings is a good social media practice at any age, because it protects what you post and also keeps strangers with bad intentions from accessing any personal information. Before you post a status, photo, comment, or any other content on social media, ask yourself: “Would I want my grandparents to see this?” If the answer is no, then don’t post it. Foul language or offensive and rude posts can reflect poorly on your character, and an admissions officer who sees it may decide you’re not a good fit. Being smart online doesn’t mean you have to hide from everyone who might be looking. If admissions officers are looking you up, it’s to learn more about you, and not necessarily to catch you behaving badly. Use your social profiles to highlight positive things about you and reinforce the activities and interests you present in your application. Post videos of your piano recitals, share links to your blog, and upload photos from your community service events. that features your service and extracurricular activities, as well as your work or internship experience. Avoid the common practice of keeping two profiles on a single social site: one for “professional” use and the other just for your friends. While you may think you’re being stealthy with a “secret” profile and a fake name, it may still contain identifying information, and you wouldn’t want someone to stumble across the “wrong” profile. Keep it simple by only using one profile for each site, and keep it clean. Once something is online, there’s a chance that anyone can view it. At , we counsel students on how to proactively use social media to their advantage and, when necessary, how to recover from social media mistakes. Remember to stay smart online and avoid any unnecessary stress in the college application process."},{"post_categories":["Profile"],"author":"Mona Li","title":"Leveraging Photos, Videos, and Presentations to Inspire and Hire","date":"November 25, 2013","content":"As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. Whether you’re reading a LinkedIn Influencer post, checking out a SlideShare presentation, or watching news clips — rich media informs, influences, and inspires us everyday. We sat down with to find out how and why he leverages photos, videos, and slideshows within his profile to not only showcase his team’s work and successes, but also to attract top talent. The most rewarding experience is identifying a major new business threat or opportunity, rallying a team around it, and then watching people swallow their fears, embrace it, and take action — and then coming out on the other side with a new business opportunity that is tremendously successful. This creates energy, motivation, and a culture that people want to be a part of. The right people make all the difference in this equation, as this is the business crucible where your next generation of leaders is born. LinkedIn has dropped the traditional barriers that used to make finding and matching job seekers with employers so inefficient and hit-or-miss difficult. As an employer, LinkedIn has now made search virtually frictionless. Therefore, the challenge has shifted from “being found” to “proving you’re the right fit.” It’s a competitive job market out there, so this goes both ways: job seekers need to show they’re the right candidate, and as an employer I know you have more career options than ever, so I need to prove that my company is the right choice for you. In this newly networked labor market, savvy job seekers and employers both understand that we have shifted to “don’t just tell me…show me.” We have evolved from job and resume boards to professional showcasing. For job seekers, don’t think of LinkedIn as just your online resume — think of it as your professional brand page. This means showing the outputs of your work, demonstrating your insights, and providing objective evidence of your accomplishments. This is where rich media can make such a difference. If you’re a designer, show your work. If you’re a consultant, show how your work has impacted your client. Did you give a presentation at an industry conference? Show it! It will give me an immediate sense of how you think, speak, and act. For employers, we have to demonstrate that the work our company does resonates with you. You need to know that you will be part of something big, important, and personally rewarding, and our job is to convince you. For example, I lead the digital area for Marriott. Now, if you’re a web designer or a mobile product manager, Marriott may not be top of mind for you in your job search. If you read that ranked us among the top retailers in mobile revenue, would you view us in a new light? (And did you know that we’re hiring?) We’re seeing that this kind of information works. I think we’re at the early stage of this shift, and LinkedIn’s new rich media tools are a real boost to helping both sides of the employment market make their case to one another in a more tangible way. I’m looking forward to the next stage in the evolution of this global exchange for professional matchmaking.

Today, it brings me immense pleasure to announce that LinkedIn is now 10 million members strong in the region.

When we first set foot in this region in 2012, LinkedIn had five million members. We’re thrilled to have doubled our member base to 10 million in just a year.

Beyond numbers, what my team and I are humbled by is the fact that millions of members have chosen LinkedIn as the platform to build their professional identities and seek opportunities to connect with industry peers and potential customers. Today, LinkedIn connects professionals across the MENA region, including the UAE, the KSA, Qatar, Egypt, Lebanon, and more. Our members include top-level CXOs, entrepreneurs, academics, engineers, doctors, marketers, and more. Here’s LinkedIn MENA at a glance: Students remain one of the fastest growing demographics on LinkedIn.

We are grateful for the overwhelming support we’ve received from our members and customers across the region, and are excited about what the future holds. We’re still a young company in MENA and our focus remains on helping all of our members be more productive and successful.

You have to balance your weight, learn how to steer, and pedal away from sidewalks, bushes, and people. I struggled immensely with all three. Entering a new job can be similar, and crashing sometimes has higher stakes than just a scraped knee and a bruised ego. You’re learning to navigate complex organizations, create leverage, and establish your own brand in the process. At LinkedIn, that “bike” is a motorcycle with jet turbines strapped to either side. Things move fast around here, so learning how to adapt quickly is what makes things fun and exciting. During my short tenure at LinkedIn, one crucial trait has helped me see my job in a different light. That trait is perspective, and here are several ways it has already helped me excel. Your career is a marathon, not a sprint. Along the way, you can sometimes get caught up in the everyday tasks, and not see the importance of where you are at the moment. As a Recruiting Associate, my day-to-day activities involve sending emails, communicating on the phone, and interacting with active and passive candidates. My job, however, is about evangelizing LinkedIn’s vision of creating economic opportunity for every professional in the world, in order to attract the best talent on the planet. When what you are doing aligns with a larger purpose, no task is ever too small. Not every day of your career will be great. But you can definitely find the right perspective even during bad days. Thinking about why you are doing your job, and what that means for your future, can be the difference between simply going through the motions and continuously pursuing excellence. My \"why\" is about impact and opportunity: I want to touch people’s pulse and show them what’s possible. With that in mind, nothing I do is meaningless. It all trends towards my career goals. Gratitude is a currency that never loses value. It is not subject to market fluctuations. You never have to ask to use it, and it never runs out. People actually want to . In college there was a dean who endeavored to “know every person by name and story.” I use that ideal daily to not just interact with the people I work with, but learn what motivates them, who they are, and what they eventually want to be.

The unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans stood at 10 percent in October, . While that’s a slight improvement from previous months, it’s still well above the 7.3 percent jobless rate for the country as a whole. LinkedIn’s Influencers  about the challenges veterans face in finding jobs after returning home. But few have been more prolific on the subject than , who has taken up the issue as one of his top causes. I spoke with Newmark by phone recently about why veterans’ unemployment is such a difficult issue to solve – and what every professional and hiring manager can do to help. Our conversation, edited slightly for space and clarity, follows: Craig Newmark: The biggest surprise has been just how good a fit they are for so many different jobs. Service members are good at making smart decisions in a hurry, and they have a great work ethic. One problem is that it’s hard to translate military skill terms to things that make sense to civilian recruiters. People have kind of forgotten that we have lots of service members coming home that are going to need a little break. A lot of the problem has to do with geography. Often, vets are some distance away from where hiring is going on. A lot of it also has to do with vets not knowing what kind of jobs they’re a fit for. One group that I’m involved with is called : That’s an effort to reach out to vets, wherever they live, to connect them with the technology industry. We want to do well; we want to do better. But part of the big problem is a lack of communication. I’ve thrown myself into the effort; I’m now talking with a lot of vets, a lot of veteran-service organizations... I think there’s a perception that there’s too big of a gap between Silicon Valley culture and military culture. So I’m doing what I can to address that in my own little way: I’m getting more people to talk to each other. For example, I think vets, or service members, could use a hand in writing a resume that a hiring manager would understand. What if I suggested and put out a call to action for recruiters and hiring managers everywhere to volunteer to help vets build their resume? Learn something about military culture. The way I’ve learned a little – just a little –  is through The . One of their big projects is to train people on how to talk to people in the military. For example, I know that soldiers are not the same things as Marines, are not the same thing as sailors. To show respect, you’ve got to use the right words. There are other differences in culture. In the military, people call others “sir.” In Silicon Valley, no one uses the term. I would like to think that any time a vet applies for a job, that when a recruiter or hiring manager sees it, that they do their best to help coach the vet and to help them re-write their resume. Everyone’s busy: recruiters and hiring managers. But if, once a week, a hiring manager or recruiter did something -- even if the vet isn’t a current fit for the job -- [it could be significant]. Maybe bring them in for a half hour, interview them, and help them improve their presentation and resume. That’s something we should check out with some of these vets’ organizations. ...This feels like it could be effective; I’ve never heard anything close to this idea. But I’m an engineer and I like to get things done. I grew up during the end of the Vietnam War. So there I am in high school, wearing a classic pocket protector and thick black glasses taped together, seriously. And I have no social skills. But I see Vietnam vets coming home and being treated badly. This stinks, but I don’t understand the issues. About seven years ago, I was at a “PBS NewsHour” thing, sitting next to a guy from the , and I intuitively understood why it would be good to help out vets. I figure if someone is going to put themselves in harm’s way, and risk taking a bullet for me, I should do something."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Mobile","Featured","Editorial"],"author":"Ankit Gupta","title":"LinkedIn and Pulse Integration: Professional News Tailored to You","date":"November 13, 2013","content":"Whether you’re commuting to work or waiting for a meeting to start, even in five minutes you can turn an idea into an action plan with the right insight and knowledge.

It can be difficult to keep on top of your job search when the rest of life is so busy. My best advice is to create a simple, consistent job search schedule and stick to it. To get you started, here’s a sample schedule to help you master LinkedIn in just 15 minutes per day. Start your week with a five-minute scan of the feed on your LinkedIn homepage. Your network may be sharing interesting articles and you may come across valuable insights from your chosen channels or the you follow. If you see an article that interests you, quickly skim it and click “like” to acknowledge the person who posted it. Spend the next 10 minutes searching for jobs that are posted on LinkedIn. A reported that Monday is the best day to look for a job, so don’t procrastinate! Many jobs allow you to apply using your LinkedIn profile, so you can quickly submit your application. If you’re a Job Seeker Premium subscriber, don’t forget to click “feature my application” so you can appear at the top of the list of job applicants for jobs where applications are collected on LinkedIn. Scroll through your feed again for the first five minutes. This time, comment on the status updates of a few of your connections. Even a simple “Congratulations!” on a job change can nurture your relationships and help you stay top of mind, which may prompt others to review your profile and even recommend an opportunity they hear about. Spend the next five minutes visiting your favorite . Post some thoughts on a Featured Discussion or do a search on your area of interest and comment on a discussion related to that topic. To get the biggest return on your time investment, you can post a discussion yourself. Asking a simple, professionally relevant question generally attracts the most comments, such as “What is your favorite all-time marketing book?” or “What tech trends are you predicting for 2014?” Take the last five minutes of your Tuesday to make sure your LinkedIn Inbox is clear. Respond to messages and connection requests to show people who reach out to you that you are eager to build and nurture your professional relationships. Start today in your home feed for five minutes, and focus this time on sharing your own status update. What’s on your mind today? Was there an article you read that you found particularly valuable? Share that and add a sentence or two of commentary with your own expert opinion. People are more likely to comment on your update if they feel they are talking to a person and not to an article. In your next 10 minutes, spend time expanding your network by using LinkedIn’s . Finding classmates and connections from your alma mater can be a great way to get your foot in the door at a company of interest. You can search by specific company, industry, job function and even your college major. If you find someone who could be a great contact, reach out directly with an InMail or connection request. Here’s an example of what to say in your outreach. Again, start with the feed on your home screen. Like or comment on at least three posts today to keep the momentum of your networking going. Consistency is crucial; the more active you are, the more active people will be in return. In the next 10 minutes, search through LinkedIn’s three million to research employers that might be a good fit for your skills and talents. One way to explore new possibilities is to view the companies that LinkedIn suggests you might be interested in. For each organization, visit that company page’s Insights tab. Check out the “People Also Viewed” area to find companies doing similar work to that organization, thus expanding your list of target options. If you see an interesting job posting on any company’s page, take a look at the “Former Employees You May Know” list and reach out to one of those contacts to get the inside scoop on that organization. Here is a sample outreach: Today, spend your first five minutes endorsing the Skills & Expertise of people in your network. LinkedIn will provide prompts on your homepage or you can click over to the profiles of the people who appear in your home feed and take time to review their list of Skills & Expertise and endorse the qualities you can vouch for. Often when you endorse other people, they will consider returning the favor. Spend the next five minutes maintaining and reviewing your own profile. When it comes to the endorsements you’ve received this week, make sure they reflect the personal brand you want to communicate to recruiters. If, for instance, someone has endorsed you for a skill related to a former career or a skill you no longer want to pursue, it’s okay to delete that skill from your list. If there are skills you’d like to be endorsed for, go ahead and add those yourself even if no one has endorsed you for them yet. You can even re-order your skills to put the most relevant ones on top. Next, take a moment to reflect on anything you accomplished over the past week that might be a valuable addition to your profile—a freelance project that you can add to the “Projects” section, for instance. When possible, , such as a PDF document or short video (as long as you have permission from your employer or client for whom you produced the work). Remember that your profile is a living resource, just like you. As you gain new experience and achieve new things, be sure your profile reflects the most up-to-date version of you. Finally, if you have any new messages or connection requests, respond to those before you head off to your well-deserved weekend. As you can see you don’t need to spend hours every day on LinkedIn to make the network work for you. The key is developing your goals, finding your most effective networking methods and sticking to them.

Instead, I opted to send Dana an InMail message in 2009. I introduced myself, Scripped, and asked to get on his calendar for a meeting. “I think there could potentially be a lot of interesting ways Triggerstreet and Scripped could work together,” I wrote. Here’s the original message: Dana responded directly to my InMail. “I just logged in to turn off the connection notifications and saw your message. If you’d still like to chat, reach me via email,” Dana replied, including his contact information. Dana and I had a terrific first conversation about our respective screenwriting communities, and what we aimed to accomplish. We agreed to do a speaking event together in Palo Alto, and just weeks later he flew up here to a packed house, . The event was a success, and we continued to email one another and exchange ideas about how to grow and develop our respective communities. By the end of 2011, of financing, from the entertainment industry to original content creation. Dana is one of the foremost thinkers when it comes to original content creation, and he introduced us to Kevin toward the end of 2011. That meeting was extraordinarily productive, and it left us wanting to find a way to work together. Over the past couple of years, my co-founder and I have spent time with Dana in LA and San Francisco. We got to know each other both professionally and personally -- Dana and I , and became fathers within a month of each other. In short, he is a quality person who genuinely wanted to help us grow our business. Just prior to raising our Series A funding, Dana and I had a lengthy conversation about the business and where we are headed. The most important challenge content marketers will face in the next decade is creating original, high quality content. , and the companies focused on that objective will soon wither away. Dana shares that vision in his business, and our goal in adding Dana and Kevin to our advisory board is to deliver that message to content marketers everywhere. And it all started with an InMail."},{"post_categories":["Featured","Veterans"],"author":"Deep Nishar","title":"Honoring US Veterans: LinkedIn redesigns veterans website","date":"November 11, 2013","content":"Today is Veterans Day in the U.S., a day to appreciate and honor those who have bravely served and continue to serve our country. . From my experience visiting the USS Lincoln in 2010 and launching our veterans initiative with the White House in 2011, it has become a personal journey for me to find ways LinkedIn can help veterans find new ways to create economic opportunity for themselves and their families. The veteran community on LinkedIn has grown at over twice the rate of the total membership and we are hearing from veterans across the world about the mentorship and support they are exchanging with other members on LinkedIn. Take for instance, , who decided to leave the Air Force and was exploring career opportunities when a colleague advised him to expand his network. Darrell turned to LinkedIn where he was able to build out his profile and share his professional story. He joined veterans groups including the group and industry groups such as . Darrell also followed , , and , among other companies, and searched for colleagues to help kickstart his next professional chapter.  Fellow veterans group members reviewed Darrell's profile and introduced him to their networks, leading to multiple job offers, including Darrell's systems engineering role at SAIC, leading to his current position at the National Geospacial Intelligence Agency. We hear stories like this everyday and it is wonderful to be part of a company that has the power to enable these kinds of discussions and opportunities to be possible.

I'm personally really excited to meet everyone’s parents here at the LinkedIn office. For years now, my father has come to my office to learn about my positions and the companies I’ve joined. It has been a great way to share my growth in my career and connect in our shared passion for the human resources industry. It’s also an easy way to show my gratitude for always supporting my career. As exciting as this day will be for many of us, we all want the day to be as smooth as possible for our parents. In preparation, we developed a quick survival guide for parents on LinkedIn Bring In Your Parents Day. To prepare, here are a few things to consider during your day: Chat with some of your son or daughter’s colleagues – it’s a great way to find out more about where they work, and who they work with Feel free to take photos of the office and perhaps your child's work to show the rest of the family Arrive on time for the event so you have time to enjoy the full experience and don’t miss anything Let your child and their boss know how you found the event and what you learned – they’ll appreciate the feedback Share advice you have learned from your own career that could be relevant and helpful Ask your child’s boss to give them a promotion or a pay raise Tell embarrassing stories about your child – that’s best to save for the relatives Give away any of the work information your child has shared with you in confidence. Your child’s colleagues may not be in the know Be the parent who asks 1,000 questions at the Q&A To give you a bit more information about the day itself, we ran a trial in our Dublin office earlier in the year where we received overwhelmingly positive feedback from parents. I’m so happy that everyone enjoyed themselves then and can’t wait to see how today unfolds. We’re so pleased to have a range of companies taking part in the day including , , , , and , all of which will have parents at their offices this morning. Also, as one of the most exciting workplaces in the world, ZSL London Zoo is helping to launch the first year of this event.

For teens like me, that’s exceptionally important. In a fiercely competitive workforce, teens are going to face a huge challenge when we graduate – finding a job. But how do we even get started? For starters, we have to figure out what we want to do after we graduate. Maybe we want to continue our education and if that’s the case we have to decide which school to attend and what we’re going to study. Those are just a few of the many questions that seem impossible to answer some days. That’s why I was excited that like me onto the site. I’ve always had an entrepreneurial spark in me, which drove me to find something that I love to do, while making money at the same time. For me, that’s social media. Being able to connect with people who have acted on similar aspirations as mine is invaluable. The ability to see where they went to university, how they landed their first job in their field and where they are today makes it that much easier for me to research career paths. They are real-life examples of the decisions I can make. So many people tell me that they wish LinkedIn was around when they were in high school, when they were trying to decide what they would do with their life. To me, that’s not surprising. At our fingertips is a resource that allows us, as teens, to help understand what we want to do. It’s a place of refuge from our overabundance of selfies, where we can showcase a side of us that people tend to think doesn’t exist. Personally, I’m a strong promoter of having positive online reputations. But unfortunately, I see digital reputations destroyed every day when my friends post questionable content to their social streams. A few of the most important things I've come to realize are: Allowing teens to be active on LinkedIn offers us the opportunity to link into our futures. It gives us so many opportunities to start building a professional profile and having a social stream dedicated solely to our career path to help jumpstart our future. Who wouldn’t want that opportunity? It’s now been a little over a month since LinkedIn was made available to high school students and I’ve already set up a meeting with a new potential client – and I’m only sixteen.

If you’re like myself, you might ask what would cause such an exclamation. Well, earlier this month we had the opportunity to hear from Eric when he came to Linkedin as part of our . LinkedIn’s co-founder Reid Hoffman interviewed Eric Ries to explore why the phenomenon of \"Lean Startup\" is having such an impact on our industry. Eric is no stranger to entrepreneurship. Beginning with his undergraduate days at Yale, he co-founded Catalyst Recruiting, and later co-founded two other companies, including , which is a social entertainment company connecting users through 3D avatar-based experiences. During his talk at LinkedIn, Eric clarified his (hard-learned) principles that he’s experienced as an entrepreneur: : In situations of high uncertainty in terms of end user product acceptance, continuously building, delivering and evaluating the effectiveness of small slices of your product functionality is crucial. The end user feedback gained from these small slices of new functionality is then used to further refine your product in future MVPs. And, the best way to design and deliver an MVP is through validated learning, which is essentially learning from your end users’ reactions to small experiments as delivered in your MVPs. : The success of a product, as viewed by your customers, is best determined by the feedback from your end users. Cleanly separate product quality, which is the quality experienced by your end users, from the execution quality of your internal processes and software. Let the product quality, as perceived by your end users, lead your product strategy. Your execution strategy is very important of course, but the risk of letting that lead your product strategy is that you may deliver an excellently built product that no one wants. : Another key concept of Lean Startup is the Pivot. This comes from the concept of Pivot or Persevere, which is knowing when to change your direction or continue with your current strategy. Oftentimes, we get stuck in optimizing a particular feature, when in fact there may be a different, and much more valuable, path to follow -- this means that you significantly change your strategy, or do a “pivot.” The key here is to always maintain fidelity to the vision of what you are trying to do, even if you have to change the specific implementation or strategy that you are currently working on. : Entrepreneurship is about managing the uncertainty of a strategy, and is not about the size of an organization. The fundamental question of how do you know you if are making the right progress if you don’t exactly know the end goal, is the same for startups as it is for large companies. Large companies most often have established profitable products in a portfolio. However, newly conceived products within the portfolio most likely have uncertain futures, such as bringing an established product to a new platform, a new geography, a new use case, or a new distribution channel.  And then there are competitors that are trying to make your existing product’s lifespan as uncertain as possible. Manage that part of your portfolio that is in high uncertainty by using the same entrepreneurial lean startup organizational techniques -- with autonomous, cross-functional, and dedicated teams. This can be hard to do in larger companies, so be sure to give those teams proper support and leadership. Overall, the most important rule to remember is that in situations of high uncertainty, “whoever learns the fastest wins.” In our modern world of hyper-speed competition, mastering the Lean Startup principles of validated learning, as executed through fast build-measure-learn cycles, gives you that necessary edge to win.

This post contains non-GAAP financials measures relating to the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures at and additional details regarding the use of non-GAAP measures below.  This presentation also contains forward-looking statements about our products, including our investments in products, technology and other key strategic areas, certain non-financial metrics, such as member growth and engagement, and our expected financial metrics such as revenue, adjusted EBITDA, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation for the fourth quarter of 2013 and the full fiscal year 2013. The achievement of the matters covered by such forward-looking statements involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, the company’s results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements the company makes. The risks and uncertainties referred to above include - but are not limited to - risks associated with: our limited operating history in a new and unproven market; engagement of our members; the price volatility of our Class A common stock; general economic conditions; expectations regarding the return on our strategic investments; execution of our plans and strategies, including with respect to mobile products and features; security measures and the risk that they may not be sufficient to secure our member data adequately or that we are  subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of members to access our solutions; expectations regarding our ability to timely and effectively scale and adapt existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that our  solutions are accessible at all times with short or no perceptible load times; our ability to maintain our rate of revenue growth and manage our expenses and investment plans; our ability to accurately track our key metrics internally; members and customers curtailing or ceasing to use our solutions; our core value of putting members first, which may conflict with the short-term interests of the business; privacy and changes in regulations in the United States, Europe or elsewhere, which could impact our ability to serve our members or curtail our monetization efforts; litigation and regulatory issues; increasing competition; our ability to manage our growth; our ability to recruit and retain our employees; the application of US and international tax laws on our tax structure and any changes to such tax laws; acquisitions we have made or may make in the future; and the dual class structure of our common stock. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company’s financial results is included in filings it makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K that was filed for the year ended December 31, 2012, and additional information will also be set forth in our Form 10-Q that will be filed for the quarter ended September 30, 2013, which should be read in conjunction with these financial results.  These documents are or will be available on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Relations page of the company's website at .  All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of October 29, 2013, and LinkedIn undertakes no duty to update this information. To supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: . The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to competitors' operating results. . The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates internal comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by including the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company believes that the inclusion of the income tax effects provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from non-GAAP net income. During the third quarter of 2013, the company excluded certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income (loss) guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA. As items that impact net income (loss) are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net income (loss) is not available without unreasonable effort."},{"post_categories":["Asia Pacific","International"],"author":"Cliff Rosenberg","title":"Celebrating 5 Million LinkedIn Members in Australia","date":"October 30, 2013","content":"I’m excited to announce that Australia is now home to more than 5 million LinkedIn members.

It is almost four years since I had the privilege of opening the Australia office with a small start –up team. Back then, in January 2010, LinkedIn had one million Australian members and a handful of customers. Today, we have more than 150 staff across three offices in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth; with scores of enterprises, small businesses and agencies leveraging LinkedIn to transform the way they hire, market and sell. This includes 92 of the ASX200 companies leveraging LinkedIn Talent Solutions. It has been a great privilege to witness this growth and be involved on this exciting journey since day one. Of course, behind every milestone there is a story to tell, and from Perth to Sydney and from Darwin to Hobart, Australian professionals have sought new and innovative ways to stay connected, keep ahead with industry trends, win new business, market their brand and hire the best talent. The pace of new members in Australia continues to increase, with one million new members joining in the past 6 months alone – half the timeframe as previous milestones. This surge in new members represents a broad cross section of Australian industries. The top five Australian industries represented on LinkedIn are IT & Services, Construction, Financial Services, Education Management and Hospital & Health Care. One of the reasons we’re seeing so much interest from Australian professionals is because we’re making ourselves increasingly relevant to them in providing both local and global insights.

Four-fifths of the business leaders that answered our survey were working before they were 18 years old. Reassuringly, these weren’t all prestigious assignments. In fact, when we surveyed participating Influencers on their early jobs, 39 percent said that their first professional gig comprised mostly grunt work.

Mishaps like the bird-sale scheme didn’t discourage Branson, however. His mother, a practiced self-starter, taught him to embrace his mistakes, and that “if an item doesn’t sell, you try something else.” Others showed their resoluteness at a young age: GE CMO Beth Comstock found herself when she took an assembly line job in a factory that produced spatulas and trash cans.

Many Influencers got hooked on the industry they started out in. Of those surveyed, 17 have stayed in the same field since that first assignment.

But what if I told you that LinkedIn changed my perspective on life? Back in March 2013, , a social enterprise bringing wheelchair access to South Africans (and soon to Kenyans) used program to recruit me for their board. Although I had no prior connection to UHAMBO, the Executive Director who wanted to build experience in fundraising on her board reached out to me after a quick search on LinkedIn. I have directed fund development programs for over ten years now. Most of it aimed at resourcing African communities. Lucinda explains: “A friend had mentioned as another great US-based organization that had been making successful small investments in rural African towns since 2000. So when I conducted a LinkedIn search for board members and Firelight’s Development Director, , came up in the top 10 results, it felt like magic. The alignment has been remarkable and the addition of Joop on the Board in just the past few months has enabled our growth and evolution.” I have now been on the UHAMBO Board since April. We recently got our first grant to launch a program in Kenya. And a week ago, as part of our October board meeting, we listened to one of our South African partners as he described the impact a well-fitted locally made wheelchair can have on the development of a child. Most wheelchairs that are available in African countries are one size - Large. A child’s bad posture as a result of having to rely on an oversized chair can lead to a series of health complications, at times even loss of life if breathing is hindered. So the fit of a chair is critical. UHAMBO works to ensure children have access to well-fitted chairs. Chairs made in country, by local people, for a local market. My UHAMBO Board experience is incredibly fulfilling. Even though I have lived and worked in Africa, I had not considered wheelchair access to be such an important issue for so many. In South Africa alone, more than 750,000 people are in need of appropriate wheelchairs and posture support devices. What I am learning is changing my perspective. I realize now that a wheelchair has severe limits. Distribution needs to be accompanied with guidance on how to maintain the chairs and how to fit them well to the user. This becomes more likely when we build the chairs in country. But ultimately, limits will remain unless we encourage real awareness and social change in favor of people with disabilities. And I am proud to be part of working toward a solution. That would not have been the case without LinkedIn.

Now, the opportunity to change your career trajectory can happen anywhere, at any time. People are cultivating their goals and aspirations on the go, and finding that their career is more satisfying when it transcends what they do from 9-5. Your professional identity can span beyond the desk we sit in now, to where we aspire to be perhaps five, or even ten years from now. Whether you’re at your office in Denver, standing in line at a coffee shop in Dubai, or on your couch at home -- the LinkedIn experience and knowledge flow is seamless from one device to the other, and from one timezone to the next. When you combine the unique business knowledge accessible on LinkedIn with the power of a global professional network, you can turn an aspiration into a reality. And we want to help make each of your professional moments matter -- whenever and wherever you may be.

One experience that sticks out for me is the “reading buddy.” The reading buddy was typically an older student who was assigned to a younger student to help develop reading skills and confidence. This buddy served as a role model to the younger student. I now realize that this dynamic was the precursor to what has become a key success factor in our professional lives. The reading buddies of the professional world have a different name but serve a similar purpose: to provide guidance and support while developing you to become a stronger professional. They are now called mentors. In my first few months as a utility-paying, dinner-making “adult” professional, I have identified three key qualities that help to shape the types of mentors that are essential to a new college graduate entering the workforce. The supportive mentor is someone you respect and look up to, but is also someone you can be vulnerable around if you need to be. As one can imagine, the “real world” can be a bit shocking to new graduates and this mentor is your go-to in times of need. This mentor may be a peer, or close to it, who has gone through a similar transition recently. The support provided by this mentor reaffirms that you are not alone this new stage of your life and who reassures you that your company and colleagues truly care. The inspirational mentor is easy to spot, but looks different for every individual. This mentor is someone who is in a place where you wish to be one day. This mentor may currently work in your dream job or they are crushing it in your current role. This mentor has successfully routed his or her career path and can provide inspiration and guidance for yours. The inspiration provided by this mentor can come in forms of a job shadow experience, a lecture or informational interviews, ideally with the goal of strategic career planning. The mentor who enables your professional growth is likely someone you directly report to who has witnessed your early wins and can champion you within the company. This mentor plays a crucial role in the development and adoption of your professional brand. This mentor is likely a respected leader within the company whose opinions are taken seriously. The professional growth this mentor helps you achieve will move the needle for you in significant ways. Simply put, different mentors serve different purposes and throughout different stages in one’s career - different mentors will surface. However as a new graduate, these three qualities in mentors have been immensely important to success in my first quarter as a professional. What types of qualities do you see in your mentors? If you are a mentor, do you fall into one of the three buckets more heavily or do you embody all three qualities for your mentees?

Many job seekers eagerly took on these roles and thrived in them. If you’ve been a freelancer, consultant or contractor and are now ready to work full time again, here are some ways LinkedIn can help you make your move. The key is to address the main concern a potential employer will have (i.e., that you don’t want a boss or that you aren’t ready to return to corporate life) and to demonstrate that the skills and experience you built as a freelancer will greatly benefit your next employer. Here are five specific strategies: Your LinkedIn profile headline is prime real estate for two reasons. First, it’s the first phrase people will see about you when they click on your profile, and those first impressions stick. Second, it’s a keyword hot spot for anyone, recruiters especially, conducting searches on LinkedIn. Freelancers seeking full-time work should keep three things in mind when writing headlines: Putting it all together, here’s one example: “Client-winning marketing specialist with 10 years experience in the healthcare and medical device industries” Note that it is fine to include your time freelancing in your years of experience. Just be sure to remove words like “freelancer,” “contractor” or “consultant” from your headline and use them sparingly in your profile if you are now seeking full-time work. Instead, use more general words like “experienced in,” “expert” and “professional.” For job seekers, think of your profile Summary as a cross between a professional bio and a cover letter. For making the transition from freelance to full-time, I suggest you announce your career goal in your opening sentence so it is totally clear that you are now seeking a full-time job. Then you can summarize your previous work—freelance or otherwise—that has provided you with the experience and skills an employer might be looking for. Here’s an example: “I am a project manager with 10 years of experience in the technology industry, with a special focus on developing mobile products and services. Through a variety of full-time and freelance roles, I have demonstrated skills including time management, risk management, communication, organization and calm under pressure. I am an expert user of Microsoft Project and other project management software. After an opening paragraph like this, you should concisely explain your qualifications (remember, you are writing on a website, not in an academic paper) and highlight specific experiences that qualify you for the jobs to which you are now applying. What differentiates a LinkedIn profile from something like a resume is Experience and Summary sections. Take full advantage of this feature, especially when describing the work you completed in your freelance roles. This will show to employers the quality of work you did while freelancing. (Just be sure to receive approval from clients before sharing any work you completed on their behalf). Examples include: Of course your profile is only one way to sell yourself. Your connections can help you by giving you endorsements for your skills and recommendations for your hard work. Specifically, you’ll want your connections to vouch for the fact that you work well with others. This will reinforce the fact that you truly do want to transition back into full-time work with a boss. To start, ask for recommendations from people who have supervised your work regularly or hired you consistently in your freelance gig. These people have the long-range view of you and have seen your work evolve over time. You should also ask them to mention your skills as a collaborator, communicator and manager. Proving that you can be an on-going contributor and team player will help you in your full-time employment search. You’ll want to fill your with similar keywords that prove your functional skill set as well as your ability to be a great employee. As for getting people in your network to endorse these skills, my advice is to be a “go-giver” not a “go-getter.” Give honest endorsements to others and it’s likely they’ll return the favor. A key component to any successful job search is the people and organizations you meet with, speak to, follow and ask for advice. Time and again, statistics show that networking is the most effective way to land a job. When it comes to transitioning from freelance to full-time, it’s important to broaden your network and alert your existing contacts that you are making the change. When it comes to broadening your network, one strategy is to in the industry in which you’d like to work. (It’s also a wise idea to leave groups dedicated to freelancing or consulting so as not to send a mixed message to potential employers). In these new groups, be sure to make yourself visible by joining conversations and reaching out to connect with anyone who seems like an interesting new contact. It’s also smart to expand your network by following the of organizations that appeal to you as full-time employers. You’ll simultaneously learn about new jobs as they are posted and learn about people in your extended network who work for those organizations. Send messages to these friends-of-friends to introduce yourself and perhaps ask for some guidance. (Read on writing great introductory InMails.)[LP1] When it comes to reaching out to your existing contacts, send personalized, positive messages or InMails to people in your network to share your news and ask for their assistance. Here is an example: Finally, if you’d like to maintain some consulting or freelance work while you search for a full-time position, one strategy is to for your independent work. You can design a page that includes a listing of your services, recommendations from clients and updates from you about the projects you are working on. To launch such a page successfully, I’d recommend sending a message to all of your clients announcing that the page is live and asking them to “follow” it to keep up with your freelance activities. Good luck, I wish you all the best, and as always, see you on LinkedIn!"},{"post_categories":["Profile"],"author":"Christine Wendling","title":"A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words, Make Your LinkedIn Profile Shine [SLIDESHOW]","date":"October 3, 2013","content":"Professionals today are as diverse and unique as their fingerprints. They are out in the world learning, creating and building with limited ways to show these achievements and aspirations. As a professional whose work is represented through visuals, not just words, it’s a challenge I’ve been all too familiar with. For the first time, LinkedIn is giving creative “right brained” professionals like myself a new way to through pictures, videos, documents and more. And we’ve been blown away by what our members have done. So we set out to find three profiles that really shine, and asked those members what inspired them to share, what they’ve gained and what advice they have for other professionals interested in demonstrating what they do in a compelling way. Here are some of their lively, inspirational and compelling stories:   As an artist, my work is more visual than anything else. While creating my LinkedIn profile, I noticed the option to upload files, which I didn’t realize was possible. I immediately decided to add samples of my work for potential clients and jobs. I always want to show what I have done and my potential. The visual content I uploaded has gotten great reviews from those that I have shared my LinkedIn profile with and I’m sure it is one of the reasons clients choose to work with me. I always want everyone to see my work not just read about it. To my fellow LinkedIn members I would say, be very detailed in your descriptions. If you have visual content, share as much as you can and a variety of it. In that way, your potential clients, bosses, colleagues and workmates can not only see what you have done, but what you can do. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. I knew that in today’s economy, with everything switching over rapidly to being online, I needed a \"one stop shop\" that I could refer people to when searching for jobs or looking for people that might join my team. I also wanted to showcase some of the awesome things I’ve done for some pretty high profile people. After my time in the military, it became obvious that the job market was not the same as when I joined the military 16 years prior. Rarely is the job hunt about going into an office and asking for a paper application, these days everything is online. I realized that instead of sending employers, or recruiters, emails with attachments and various documents, I could take my time and really put some effort into the services that LinkedIn has provided me. There I can showcase a full and thorough history of my jobs, awards and experience as well as various pictures of events and food that I have done. This way my LinkedIn profile becomes a \"one stop shop\" that paints a picture of who I am and what I could bring to a potential employer. Since I took the time to put up food pictures, I have not only received an increase in views to my profile, but more people have reached out to connect with me about potential job opportunities and to share other valuable information. I share content on other social networks as well, but LinkedIn provides the perfect platform to catch the attention of potential recruiters or professional contacts since it’s a place where many of these individuals are naturally looking anyway. You never know who will stumble across your profile, so it should always look its best! Take the time to take full advantage of LinkedIn like I have. A little bit of time spent definitely pays off when you get that unexpected phone call or email from an employer or connection with a potential life changing career opportunity. Many employers now also accept your LinkedIn profile as a job application. This makes the process so much easier and saves a lot of time! I can tell you personally that every time I have applied for a job with my profile, I have at least received an email or call response. To me, this shows that they were interested in what they saw on my profile, took the time to read it and maybe even shared it with others. As a sports broadcaster, my demo reel is my resume. Each demo reel I've created in my career has led me to opportunities and helped me climb the ladder in the broadcast business. Including it on my LinkedIn profile gives me a chance to showcase my work and continue to build my brand, which opens up an entirely new realm of possibilities. By leveraging the rich media feature, my career highlights are consolidated into one centralized location. There is no need for professionals to visit several websites to find examples of my reporting. My LinkedIn profile provides them with an interactive resume. My broadcasting positions and corresponding multimedia are presented in an organized, easy-to-understand format. Using LinkedIn's rich media feature to add visual content to your profile will make it unique and separate it from others in your industry. Photos, presentations, and links to your work will enhance the fantastic achievements you've already included in your profile. As the old saying goes, \"Don't just tell them, show them.\" We hope these examples inspire you to take advantage of your LinkedIn portfolio. Have a great shot of a set you worked on? Post it. Want to flex those design muscles by showing off your latest creation? Post it.

What if recruiters like myself leveraged LinkedIn to help nonprofits find talented staff members? I was inspired to bring Recruiters for Good (RFG) to life for a few reasons. I wanted to help budget-strapped nonprofits recruit top talent, as we know talent is the #1 driver of an organization’s success and the nonprofit sector is in many ways in greatest need of improving talent recruitment efforts. This idea was perfectly aligned with (LIFG)’s mission of connecting the skills and passions of members and employees with opportunities to make a positive impact. Most importantly, this was an opportunity for Transformation - for me and our teams as we hone our recruiting skills in a different industry context, for the company as we leverage our unique resources to help nonprofits, and for the world as we help world-changing organizations find the talent they need to not just address - but solve - the world’s toughest, most intractable problems. LinkedIn leadership responded to my idea with wholehearted support and rallied other employees to join the effort. They also provided helpful insight into how best to get this initiative off the ground: “Don’t get grandiose. Start small, get a few successes, and then we’ll see if it can scale.” Today, more than 30 professionals in 5 countries from companies like LinkedIn, Google, Shopkick, and Bloom Energy are participating in RFG. So far, we’ve placed 6 staff members in 7 nonprofit organizations. How did we do it? Exactly as suggested; we started off small, partnering with a few local nonprofits to help them find candidates for open positions. We did what we do best as LinkedIn recruiters: using , we searched for profiles of potential candidates who best matched the qualifications given to us by the nonprofits. In just a few hours, we identified 150 qualified candidates, ultimately securing great candidates for our nonprofit partners including an Executive Director in Chicago for , a national nonprofit that improves school conditions, reduces bullying and improves student engagement in school through play. The idea just took off from there. Our colleagues in Australia formed a RFG chapter, partnering with . We were invited to the White House to help find innovators for the Presidential Innovation Fellowship. And we formed a partnership with , the world’s largest network of social entrepreneurs with nearly 3,000 Ashoka Fellows in 70 countries, to help them find and select new Fellows and key staff. Most importantly, our nonprofit partners are overjoyed about the value this program has provided for them. Change Leader at Ashoka, recently wrote: So we started small and benefited from talented LinkedIn employees with personal passions to expand our efforts. Today, my vision is to expand this program to companies beyond LinkedIn to connect nonprofits around the world with top talent. Given that and contributes to the well-being of countless people around the world, the impact of this would be truly tremendous.

The truth is the perfect university doesn’t exist, but with the right guidance and resources, students can find many colleges where they can be successful and thrive. So what factors should college-bound teens consider when making their wish list? It’s not the school with the best parties, the weather or where their best friend or boyfriend is applying. It all comes down to academic, social and financial fit. Imagine you’re starting college tomorrow, which courses would you take? Are there research, internship and study abroad opportunities offered in your areas of interest? Which extracurricular activities would you take advantage of on and off campus? Have you had an open conversation with your parents about their potential financial contribution? If you do your research correctly, you should end up with a list of 12 to 15 good-fit schools. This should reflect a balance of reach, target and likely schools, any of which you’d be happy to attend. For students who aren’t sure exactly where to begin, here are some tips: It’s never too early to begin researching schools. Thanks to the Internet, there is a wealth of information readily available. You can visit college websites, page through online course catalogs and even take virtual campus tours and attend virtual college fairs. Get a real student perspective and good sense of campus culture by reading the school newspaper and blog online. LinkedIn also provides you with the opportunity to make informed decisions on which universities, majors and skills will help you achieve professional success – making college matchmaking even easier. The newly launched allows higher education institutions to have dedicated pages so they can build their community and directly engage with prospective students, current students, parents and alumni. University Pages allow college-bound teens to access important information on colleges, such as the cost of tuition, notable alumni and more. You can also gain valuable insights on LinkedIn about what it’s really like on campus by connecting with current students and recent graduates, and trace the educational and professional paths of notable alumni by following the most influential business leaders and company pages. You will likely spend four years of your life at college, and nothing beats the gut check that comes with an in-person campus visit. Plan on visiting the schools that you are considering seriously while school is in session. It’s important to attend both the official information session and the campus tour, as it shows demonstrated interest in the school. However, also make time to explore the campus and local community. Do’s and don’ts of a campus visit: Alumni networks are a great resource that often go untapped. You should talk to your college guidance counselor and see if there are any alumni from your high school who currently attend or have recently attended the colleges that interest you. These alumni often come from a similar background and can talk about what the transition to the college was like for them. They may also be willing to host an overnight stay. Not sure what to study or major in? Network in a field of choice or in a few that are of interest. can help you connect with professionals who can provide insight into a career – and who may be potential employers in the future. Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all college. If you take the time to do your research early on in the admissions process, you will be happily attending a good fit college come orientation!"},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Blake Lawit","title":"Setting the Record Straight on False Accusations","date":"September 21, 2013","content":"As you may have read recently, a class action lawsuit was filed against LinkedIn last week.

But spare some sympathy for the hiring managers. Sifting through resumes and coaxing out revealing insights in interviews is its own exhausting grind. And what’s at stake is a company’s most important asset: its talent. More than 80 of LinkedIn’s Influencers -- thought leaders and experts across industries who write original content for LinkedIn -- had lots to say about this topic in We also teamed up with the New York Times to pull together the best hiring advice out there, including Q&As with career experts. Through these blog posts, we get a firsthand look at the hiring philosophies of industry giants like Richard Branson, Deepak Chopra, Sallie Krawcheck and dozens more. The series confirms that building a great team is arguably the most important thing to get right when running a company or department, and also one of the toughest. The interview process can also be painful: We quizzed 43 Influencers on their hiring habits, and a full quarter of those we surveyed have gone so far as to fake some type of emergency to end a bad interview. Most Influencers have achieved extraordinary success not only on the strength of their own skills, but their talent at evaluating and attracting the best people to fill open roles. As a result, the “How I Hire” series is a goldmine of hiring tips and tricks. Read closely and you might even learn the key to getting a job with an Influencer. Below are a few key takeaways: A strong majority of the Influencers we surveyed say that instinct is more important than data for hiring decisions. But there’s a vocal minority that disagrees, arguing that following your gut can lead you astray. As attractive as trusting your instincts might seem, many managers instead rest their hiring decisions on diagnostics that compare different candidates according to the same criteria. Depending on the role, those criteria vary widely. Good interviewers ask lots of smart questions. But again and again, we heard Influencers say that specific responses were less important than other factors like the quality of the conversation and the way candidates thought about questions. In other words, don’t fret if you don’t have the perfect response to an interview query. Your questioner might be testing you for something else entirely. Many Influencers made the point, in different ways, that it’s as important, if not more, to hire a team that works well together than it is to hire a bunch of great individuals. For many, the hiring process is built around identifying very specific traits. Influencers don’t just hire for broadly defined character traits like cooperation or persistence. Many have been building teams for so long that they’ve given names to the unique skill sets or combinations of traits that the perfect hire must posses. How do Influencers get so good at hiring? By learning from their mistakes. Nearly all of the Influencers we surveyed said at some point they’ve regretted a hiring decision they made. From that, many have taken lessons about how to screen out candidates who won’t work out. To peek into the minds of dozens more who have mastered staffing (and to learn from their mistakes), check out the full series For more strengths to look for and flubs to avoid when hiring, log on to LinkedIn at 2 p.m. EST on Thursday, Sept. 26, when I’ll be moderating a live chat on hiring with New York Times columnist Adam Bryant and human resources expert Josh Bersin.

I probably read 3 to 4 articles a week on happiness at work, happiness at home, the 20 things happy people do differently, etc. What struck me in Gretchen’s talk is that she provides the framework to take action. Given that habits impact so many of our daily actions, creating habits that work for you can ultimately lead to greater happiness. No, there isn’t some magical number of days you have to floss your teeth in order for that habit to stick. Consider that myth busted. Instead, Gretchen shared that the route to happiness starts by first understanding yourself and how you manage both internal and external expectations. In a , Gretchen outlines four classifications for understanding which personality type people are: : accepts rules, whether from outside or inside. An upholder meets deadlines, follows doctor’s order, keeps a New Year’s resolution. I am an Upholder, 100%. : questions rules and accepts them only if they make sense. They may choose to follow rules, or not, according to their judgment. : flouts rules, from outside or inside. They resist control. Give a rebel a rule, and the rebel will want to do the very opposite thing. : accepts outside rules, but doesn’t like to adopt self-imposed rules. Knowing which personality type you are will help you succeed next time you are determined to hit the gym daily or cut out unhealthy snacks. So, which personality type are you?

We’re committed to earning and keeping your trust in everything we do. At LinkedIn, we have a high bar when it comes to responding to government requests for member data. We scrutinize and evaluate every request, and only provide data when we believe we’re legally required to, or in emergency situations. We also take steps to let members know before turning over their data, unless we’re legally prohibited to do so or the request is an emergency. Our goal is to be as open as possible about government requests for member data. This is why, since 2011, we’ve published a report called the Transparency Report every six months that tells our members how many requests for member data we receive from governments around the world, the number of member accounts impacted and the percentage of requests we respond to. Today, we’re publishing our for the first 6 months of 2013. Unfortunately, our Transparency Report doesn’t include requests related to U.S. national security-related matters. This is because the U.S. government prohibits us from doing so. We believe our members and the LinkedIn community deserve to know this information, especially in light of recent revelations about the nature of U.S. government surveillance. We’ve been in discussions with the U.S. government for months in an effort to convince them to allow us to release these numbers as part of our Transparency Report and these discussions recently reached an impasse. Despite our best efforts, we are still prohibited from sharing information about national security-related requests in a way that’s meaningful to our members and community.  So we’re left with no choice but to file to the U.S. government’s position.

Your profile is a great place to highlight your marketable skills and is your vehicle for getting found by recruiters and hiring managers all over the world. But, what if you need your job search to stay confidential, perhaps because you are currently employed? Never fear! I’ve got you covered, and rest assured there are still many ways to attract attention, tap your network and connect with recruiters on LinkedIn while maintaining your privacy. Here’s how. One way to become more findable by recruiters is to add keywords and phrases to your LinkedIn profile that are relevant to the jobs you seek. However, frequent or abundant changes to your profile may indicate to others that you are considering making a move. To minimize the likelihood that your connections will notice your profile improvements, head over to your area, which you can find by clicking on your headshot in the top right corner of LinkedIn, and click on the “Turn on/off your activity broadcasts” link. Uncheck the box that pops up here so your connections will no longer receive updates about changes to your profile or other actions you take on LinkedIn, such as posting in a Group discussion. While you are keeping your activity private, you can still have visibility to recruiters and networking contacts. One way to attract positive attention while keeping your job search private is to regularly update your status. Post interesting articles related to your industry if you are job hunting in your current field or, if you are are a career changer, post articles and updates about general topics such as leadership, communication or technology trends. Whether your job hunt is public or private, I recommend exploring the LinkedIn profiles of people you admire professionally. Looking at those individuals’ profiles can give you a sense of what experiences, skills and groups could be most valuable to your own career. If you find someone you particularly admire -- ideally someone with no connection to your current employer -- you might even reach out to that person through an InMail to express your admiration and ask if that person might be willing to share some career advice with you. However, if you are viewing the profiles of people who know your employer, and you are concerned they will discover you’ve viewed their profiles often and connect back with your boss about it, you have options. In the same Privacy & Settings area, click on the “Select what others see when you’ve viewed their profile” link. Here you can change the way you appear in others’ “Who’s Viewed Your Profile” area so that you will remain anonymous. Note: Unless you are a Job Seeker Premium subscriber, when you switch to an anonymous status you will no longer be able to track “Who’s Viewed Your Profile” and Profile Stats for yourself, so carefully consider this option and switch out of it as soon as your research is done. One of the most effective ways to land your next gig is through networking. One great way to make new connections is by joining , such as your university alumni groups and industry networks. However, if you are joining many new groups, or groups related to an industry you are hoping to transition into, you may raise some red flags with your current boss or colleagues. Fortunately, as you join groups relevant to your new career interests, you have the option to hide those new memberships so they do not appear on your Profile and your activity in those groups is not broadcast to your network. In mode, scroll down and click on the pencil symbol next to “Groups.” Under each group name, you will see either the word “Visible” or “Hidden.” To change a group’s visibility on your profile, roll over that word and click on “Change.” On the resulting screen, uncheck the box next to “Display the group logo on your profile” to remove it from public view. Keep in mind, however, that your fellow members of that group will be able to see anything you post within that group. So, the best way to enjoy the benefits of group membership while keeping your job search off the grid is to reach out to fellow group members privately. If you see a group discussion you’d really like to comment on -- perhaps a recruiter has posted a question related to your area of expertise -- you have options. You can click on that group discussion and instead of commenting publicly for all group members to see, you can click “Reply privately” and respond only to the person who posted the discussion or comment. Alternatively, you can send an InMail to the person and reference the group discussion in your message. As mentioned above, sharing articles, thoughts, ideas and questions related to your job search with your network can lead to conversations that result in learning and professional growth. Public job seekers can also use status updates to announce or request help with their job searches. For the private job seeker seeking help from your LinkedIn contacts, I recommend reaching out privately to your connections via individual messages or using InMail to reach new contacts. Just keep in mind that your messages should be personalized to each individual (no one likes generic “Dear Everyone” messages) and be framed in a positive, grateful tone. Here is an example: Remember, the key here is to ask for advice and not a job. You can read some more sample messages in my previous post on . For those using LinkedIn’s , you have the option to include the Job Seeker Premium briefcase badge on your profile to indicate that you are looking for a new position and help you stand out in searches. I highly recommend that you turn that badge on for public job searches, but if you’re seeking privacy, visit the section of your Settings page to select the general premium “in” badge instead. I also recommend opting for OpenLink, the small circular icon that indicates you are open to receiving messages from anyone on LinkedIn. It’s like having a toll-free number and ensures that you’ll never miss a message or potential opportunity. Job hunting privately on LinkedIn takes a bit of additional effort, but the rewards are well worth it. I wish you all the best as you pursue you next opportunity. Good luck and see you on LinkedIn!"},{"post_categories":["Jobs"],"author":"Austin Pogue","title":"3 Tips on Making a New City Your Home","date":"September 13, 2013","content":"You could say I’ve moved a lot recently. During the past five years, I’ve lived in San Diego, Hanover, NH; Rome, Italy; Oxford, England; Portland, OR; and finally San Francisco, where I see my roots taking hold for the first time. My youth doesn’t often do me justice in trying to acquaint myself with a new city. At times I feel like I just don’t know what to look for when I arrive, but I’ve had to start from scratch enough now to understand what it takes to make a new city feel like home. Each time I’ve relocated, I’ve brought along no family, no close friends, and no identity beyond what my LinkedIn profile shows. A move to a new city should be exciting and inspirational, reigniting the childlike wonder that led us down foreign aisles at the supermarket. I’ve compiled these suggestions to save fellow student travelers and recent graduates a lot of the confusion and feelings of isolation that prevented me from making the most of my transitions. In my opinion, to live like a local you must think like a vagrant: I never considered myself a true athlete before moving to Rome for a Foreign Study Program. The best way to see a city—any city, at that—is by walking directly into the heart of it and following whichever road looks most interesting. I became a fearless walker and then a runner, pushing myself to my physical limit in order to cover the most ground. I returned to the States with a strained hamstring and a 2,000-page photo album.  I could still tell you today how to get from Trastevere to the Vatican. Ironically, I’ve met more people eating alone than I have while on the move in any context aside from bar-hopping.  If you carry yourself well and are naturally curious (looking up from your phone to see what’s around you), people will be intrigued by who you might be, and you shouldn’t shy away from starting a conversation. This is probably the most clichéd piece of advice in existence, but I don’t think people are naturally inquisitive when floating around in their “alone” bubbles. When I say “ask questions” I don’t just mean for directions or restaurant recommendations—I mean apply your mind to its context and ask around when something doesn’t make sense. This is how to avoid a 50-pound ticket for walking across the lawn of St. John’s College at Oxford. In my third month of living in the metropolis of San Francisco, I am already proud to call it home. The people, fancy food and art galleries—they all reside here with me like neighbors, and I am eager to take the tips I’ve learned to get more acquainted."},{"post_categories":["Economic Graph","Influencers"],"author":"Daniel Roth","title":"Five Years Later: Lessons from the Financial Crisis","date":"September 16, 2013","content":"In his book on the 2008 financial crisis, conducted a brief meta-analysis, looking at who was being blamed for the financial crisis.

Success is about constantly using your personal network to reach new partners, customers, and talent on behalf of your company. All the while, you’re managing your company’s online properties to create a coherent and trusted brand identity. When people research your company, they look at your LinkedIn profile, and those of your team. The concepts of brand and identity are intertwined.

Not only will this increase your company’s visibility to new customers and potential hires, it will help establish a company culture where employees are engaged with the brand and contributing to a single mission. This can be as simple as having a colleague add his/her company to their profile, ensuring they have an updated and compelling profile (including picture) or share your Company Page’s updates to their network.

So I chose a large state school that offered me a generous scholarship and – perhaps more importantly – a chance to work at a feisty student newspaper. That was seven years ago. Today, college no longer seems like such a sure bet. Yes, almost everyone agrees that a university education is still immensely valuable.

Not only was I about to start an academically challenging graduate program, I was also expected to find a competitive internship. During orientation, many of the day’s speakers - a mix of professors and folks from career services - talked about how critical our professional network would be in securing an internship. A major point they made was how professional networks take time to build, and they recommended that we get started right away. So with a good deal of determination, I started thinking about where I wanted to intern at the beginning of the semester. I knew I wanted to pursue a role in marketing so I focused my search by identifying companies that make products I love. After all, if I was going to market and evangelize a product, I wanted to make sure I truly believed in it. LinkedIn was at the top of the list. Unfortunately for me, I did not know anyone that worked in marketing at LinkedIn. But through a search on LinkedIn, I quickly discovered that the head of marketing for the team I was most interested in was a second degree connection. I reached out to our mutual connection, a friend from college, to see if he would be open to making an introduction. My friend made an inMail introduction between me and at the end of September. When I visited the Bay Area a few weeks later, I asked Ralf if I could swing by the LinkedIn offices to meet in person. We talked at a picnic table outside the office for about 20 minutes and I got an insider’s perspective of LinkedIn. Over the next few months, I reached out periodically to touch base. I also kept an eye out for what he was posting on LinkedIn and made sure to share any relevant industry news with him. I followed up after holiday break in January and started to inquire about the internship process. A few weeks later, he invited me to do a phone interview. Then an onsite interview, and by mid-February (5 months after my very first contact) I had an MBA internship offer for the summer on the marketing team.

When I reflect on how much my life has changed in one year, and the extent to which LinkedIn has contributed to this change, “transformation” seems a pretty apt word. How did it happen? It started as just a dream. In 2012, I was in London working in intellectual property (IP) law and followed legal and technology news in Silicon Valley with avid interest. For an IP/tech law geek, Silicon Valley is the ultimate mecca. It seemed to be where all the action was. It wasn’t long before I wanted to be in Silicon Valley, not just read about it, so I took an intelligent risk to make my dream a reality. Although I had never visited the West Coast, nor knew anyone there, I moved to California to reboot my career by enrolling in an IP/High Tech Masters of Law program at Santa Clara Law School. As a newcomer in a foreign market, I had to be adaptable, research my new landscape and seek out local knowledge. Most importantly, I learned that relationships matter. How did I go about building a network from nothing, you ask? Through LinkedIn, I was able to research and connect with persons whose career paths I admired, their advice proved invaluable in steering me in the right direction. A dream is nothing without execution. To truly be in the “belly of the beast”, I had to see a Silicon Valley company from the inside and I was thrilled to be offered an internship on LinkedIn’s Legal team aka the “Legal Eagles”. As one of the fastest growing companies, LinkedIn is regularly faced with a multitude of fascinating, cutting-edge legal challenges on a global scale. Using LinkedIn and working here has helped me to advance my career on an international scale. For example, several legal issues that are fairly clear-cut and favorable to Internet companies in the United States may be less straightforward in foreign territories. A global outlook, proper due diligence and sensitivity to local markets and their cultural nuances is essential in ensuring that companies are legally compliant and successful internationally. LinkedIn has introduced me to new ways of thinking, which has allowed me to reinvent myself, both personally and professionally. I’ve learned that the best lawyers act as business partners with their clients, rather than offer legal advice in a vacuum. Interns are regularly exposed to areas outside their own teams, which enabled me to understand how the legal team aligns their advice with the strategic and cultural aims of LinkedIn. Experiencing life in a Silicon Valley company was exactly what I had sought to do a year ago. The legal team inspires me every day as they aim to be the best legal team, not only in Silicon Valley, but as an enthusiastic member of the team exclaimed, “The best legal team in the world!\" Life changed, mission accomplished.

Now, you might be wondering how an intern got time on the calendar of arguably the busiest person at LinkedIn. It simply comes down to LinkedIn’s focus on making the right connections and cultivating the relationships matter. It also certified to me that LinkedIn has a non-hierarchical culture. I attended one of the Intern Speaker Series at LinkedIn. This particular talk was led by , Vice President of User Experience at LinkedIn. During his talk, Steve mentioned that if we ever got the chance to meet Jeff Weiner, we should be prepared with a question we’d like him to answer. So, after Steve’s talk, I approached him and asked permission to reference his name in an email to Jeff. Steve gave me an enthusiastic, “Go for it!” Soon after the talk, I sent an email to Jeff and by the next afternoon, I got confirmation from him that we should find a time to meet. I realized that asking for an introduction from a mutual contact is probably the best way to reach out to someone, even when that person is an executive. Often times, managers and mentors are more than willing to facilitate the conversation if you ask them. I have always wanted a chance to pick Jeff’s brain ever since I read his Influencer post about . In this post, he discusses how passion manifests itself and how people are more willing to help if they can sense that. True to form, when I met with Jeff, we ended up taking a walking meeting around the LinkedIn campus, a (the topic of another one of his Influencer posts). And, there are several valuable takeaways from this experience walking the LinkedIn campus that I want to share: After , I’ve realized that my productivity depends a great deal on how flat the organization is and that executives’ actions are good indications of a company’s culture. The fact that the CEO responded to my email within 24 hours is evidence that LinkedIn is a place where executives are available when their employees spot a problem or have questions about company operations. It helps an intern like me make an informed decision of what kind of culture I want to be a part of when I finish with school. As a young student with limited experience, one way to make the best out of your internship is to learn from others’ experience. In my case, I got to learn firsthand about a time where Jeff had to make a difficult decision and the lessons he learned from it - advice I wouldn’t have been able to find anywhere else. Reaching out to another co-worker could be very uncomfortable for some people, let alone reaching out to a high-level executive. However, I have found that putting myself in situations where I actively seek to connect with other people helps me get more comfortable with networking and collaborating with other teammates. After all, if you’re not intimidated conversing with an executive, talking to your co-worker may not be that scary either."},{"post_categories":["Privacy"],"author":"Eric Heath","title":"Updates to LinkedIn’s Terms of Service","date":"August 19, 2013","content":"At LinkedIn, we are committed to putting our members first.

I was hoping she’d stay in California, but it wasn’t looking good. She’d fallen in love with a university 2,500 miles away, and I had to admit it was the best choice if she wanted a great robotics program and an equally good music school. For the past few years, I’d watched my daughter and her friends struggle with these choices. For the most part, they were flying blind. Some knew what they wanted to study – but had no visibility into the career options that would result. Others had a career in mind, like my daughter, but little idea which school would best help them get there. The lucky ones had experienced family or friends who could help them navigate these decisions. For the others, it was truly a shot in the dark. Through my relationships at LinkedIn, I knew that hidden in millions of member profiles were powerful insights about the career outcomes of educations from universities around the world. If harnessed, these insights could provide incredible value for students – helping them explore possible futures and build a support network to help them succeed on campus and beyond. So, to make a long story short: A few months later — on the same day in August — my daughter started at her new school 2,500 miles away, and I started my new role at LinkedIn focused on helping future generations find their paths. And today, I’m delighted to announce the launch of University Pages on LinkedIn – one cornerstone of our strategy to help students at every critical milestone from campus to fulfilling, successful careers. We believe University Pages will be especially valuable for students making their first, big decision about where to attend college.

Bad Eyes. Weak Knees. And Inspired By Work!","date":"August 20, 2013","content":"Last week, LinkedIn posted from the LinkedIn Inspiration Index and one finding caught my eye -- the older we get the more inspired we are by our work. These surveys usually leave me with more questions than answers. So in this case I’m wondering if older folks are wearing glasses more rose-tinted than younger people or if are they really feeling more inspired at work. After all, the idealism of youth seems like it would be tied to inspiration. We know from research conducted by my organization, , that significant numbers of people over 45 work in settings where the focus of their work is on the greater good. About 9% of them have actually switched to such work after they turned 40. And this kind of work can be particularly inspiring. I wonder if this is also the case for younger LinkedIn members. I’ve spent the past six months touring the country to talk about – later in life work fueled by a passion to make a difference in our communities. Along the way I met scads of people in their 50s, 60s and beyond who were digging in to new kinds of work that creates a social impact.

Among the long list of incredible perks I received as an intern, the one perk that stands out the most - and lasts the longest - is the direct and open access to people and knowledge. As an intern, it’s important to be proactive about getting to know your colleagues, gaining more knowledge and expanding your professional network along the way. It can be difficult to speak up in a crowd, especially if you tend to be shy like I am, but the reward can be amazing. I’ve found in my experience that an effective way to do this is to ask questions. Asking questions may seem like a simple task, but in reality it can be quite difficult to do. Asking questions can expose a lack of knowledge or make us feel small. We might even think our question will be a waste of somebody else’s time. In my first job after completing my undergraduate studies, I rarely spoke up during team meetings. I felt as though I didn’t have anything important to say, and didn’t want to interrupt other people’s thoughts. But others around me interpreted my silence as a lack of interest in the discussion, which affected my ability to connect with my team. During my internship at LinkedIn, I’ve pushed myself to speak up. I’ve found that occasional stand-up meetings, where my team refrains from sitting to keep the meetings quick and efficient, provide a regular time to communicate with my team. The informal nature of these meetings also helps to create a comfortable setting allowing us all to speak our minds. When I encounter a problem, I do my best to narrow it down to a specific issue, and bring it up with other web developers around me, or when necessary, other . This helps my colleagues know where I am in a task, and in return, I get assistance with an issue I’ve encountered. In one instance, we even realized a more efficient method to transfer a value from one part of our application to another. Posing questions to others outside my team has also helped me expand my professional network. For example, I recently reached out to meet members of our User Experience Research team, as I am interested in learning more about how UX research is conducted at LinkedIn. I met three of them for lunch, and learned a lot about the projects our researchers tackle, in a part of LinkedIn I don’t see on a daily basis. Along with this, I made some new connections. For everybody, not just interns, there is little to lose by turning the fear of not knowing into an opportunity to learn. After all, it's better to ask questions and be sure about the answers, than to wander aimlessly, alone. In the end, question-askers can accomplish more, build up confidence, and communicate better with others."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Christine Schmidt","title":"LinkedIn Inspiration Index: These are the most inspired professionals in the world [SLIDESHOW]","date":"August 14, 2013","content":"On July 23, we launched the LinkedIn Inspiration Index to find out how inspired our members are.

With a lean, efficient team, every person is critical to success. But finding ‘rock star’ talent is a challenge - from identifying  people who fit with your company’s unique values, to competing with big companies’ brands and perks. In addition, many small businesses are in regional centers with less than ample local talent. To learn more about overcoming these hurdles, we looked to a vibrant regional center: Blacksburg, Virginia. Earlier this year, local business leaders from the Roanoke-Blacksburg area convened for the first LinkedIn Live event, and shared the tactics they use to attract top talent. Check out the slideshow for a full list of best practices we discussed: Here are some of the highlights: Before you begin the recruiting process, reflect on what’s truly important to your company.  This could be your culture, your mission, your working environment, or your sense of regional identity. Honesty is critical: as one CEO/Founder put it, “stay true to yourself and your team; don’t be something you’re not.” This will help both you and potential candidates assess fit as early as possible. In just 5 minutes, you can get a feel for the availability of candidates fitting your criteria. Knowing whether there are 100, 1000, or 10,000 profiles that meet your needs can shape your recruiting strategy.

Hiring experienced talent can help guarantee a quality team, but developing young, enthusiastic hires can sometimes yield even better results.  Explore both options and take note of what’s available to you locally - the talent you need might come from a nearby university.

Here are the top five missteps to avoid -- and how LinkedIn can help you overcome them: Companies today want employees who can hit the ground running, and that means knowing as much as possible about what that company does, who its competitors are and what’s happening in its overall industry. Beyond thoroughly researching the employer’s own website, you should follow that organization’s on LinkedIn. Pay special attention to current news the company is posting (which can provide ideas for specific questions to ask during networking conversations and formal job interviews) and the “Products & Services” page, which provides a cheat sheet to the company’s overall structure and offerings. For general insight into an employer’s industry, subscribe to that industry’s and join a few in that field to get a sense of what industry insiders are talking about. Not sure which groups will be most valuable? Look at the LinkedIn profiles of people who work for your dream employer and join the groups they belong to. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 70% of jobs are found through networking. This means that every member of your network should be cherished; any lost connection is potentially a lost opportunity. You can use to manage all of your existing connections and integrate them with your daily calendar. This means you’ll never miss an opportunity to congratulate someone on a new job or follow up on a recent meeting. Scan through your LinkedIn feed on a daily basis, too, to look for opportunities to comment on people’s status updates and the news they share. Even a simple “like” on an article someone has posted can lead to a chat, which can lead to an opportunity. To reengage with people you’ve lost touch with, check out the alumni groups of any corporations you’ve worked for and the tool to search for former university classmates, then send InMails or customized LinkedIn connection requests. The best way to avoid any potential awkwardness with a long lost contact is to read that person’s LinkedIn profile thoroughly before reaching out, and then mention something specific in your outreach to show you’ve done your homework and are genuinely interested in knowing that person again. For example: Here’s an example of a mistake I see frequently: wanting to be unique and creative, an aspiring writer will create the LinkedIn headline, “Passionate and clever wordsmith.” That’s great, but when someone is looking to hire a writer, he or she is most likely to search with the word “writer.” Don’t get too fancy! Recruiters, in particular, use keywords to find talent, so it’s important to research the keywords that a recruiter might be using to find someone with your particular skills. If you’re not sure what keywords to include in your headline and throughout your profile, scan through the that appeal to you. Recruiters have likely provided you with the exact words they want. To test whether or not you are attracting the right people (including recruiters) to your profile, check out your stats. In particular, check out the listing of keywords that people used to arrive at your profile. If you don’t like what you see, it’s time to adjust the words you are using to describe yourself. In today’s multimedia world, it’s no longer enough to have a list of bullet points on a resume explaining your fabulousness. More and more, employers want to see actual examples of the work you’ve accomplished, such as PowerPoint slides of presentations you’ve created, videos of speeches you’ve given, photographs of products you’ve designed, examples of code you’ve written and other visuals depending on your industry and job function. On LinkedIn, to create what is essentially an online professional portfolio. Just be careful not to post any work that is confidential! It’s no secret that jobs can get filled quickly in today’s competitive economy, so don’t make the mistake of waiting too long to submit your application. In my opinion, you should apply for a position within 12 to 24 hours of discovering it. (This means, of course, that you have already invested the time in creating an All-Star-level LinkedIn profile and have drafted template cover letters that you can quickly customize for each position). If you are out and about and your LinkedIn profile is ready and waiting, you can now even . When it comes to landing a job, the early applicant definitely catches the offer! To summarize, a successful job search requires research, relationships, attention to detail and action. There are never any guarantees in a tough job market, but if you avoid the common mistakes listed above, you’re sure to be way ahead of the competition."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Life"],"author":"Brett Wallace","title":"Think Like an Artist to Lead Creatively [SLIDESHOW]","date":"August 6, 2013","content":"Artists embody many creative leadership traits such as exploration, authenticity and adaptability. And, in an increasingly connected and dynamic world filled with data and technology, these types of creative leadership skills have grown in importance for professionals seeking innovation. Entrepreneurs, leaders, and the general public can learn a lot from artists. I am passionate about creative leadership because in addition to leading a region within LinkedIn’s global sales organization, I am also an accomplished artist. In the process of creating and showing my work over the last 20 years, I have learned a few lessons in creative leadership that have had a profound impact on my business and life.  The best artists “see” more of the world and explore what’s possible by experimenting and taking intelligent risks. Cubism never existed before Picasso pioneered it.  And, in the 1950’s, when Abstract Expressionism dominated the art world, with its spontaneity, Jasper Johns revolutionized art by painting simple yet powerful icons, such as flags and maps, forcing us to see things we already know in a new way. Artists like Picasso and Johns made breakthroughs by changing the meaning of art and making new things that raised questions about what art could be. They inspired me to explore and search for breakthrough opportunities. I applied this lesson to my business life when I joined a new, strategic business inside LinkedIn called . I joined this group to help explore and scale this business.  This product helps sales professionals by giving them breakthrough social insights and data that did not previously exist, and as a result of its success, a massive transformation is underway in the sales industry. Whether we are in established or emerging businesses, there are possibilities to explore all around us. While we excel in our core responsibilities, it's important for us to explore the possibilities, take intelligent risks and inspire others to do the same. This is where true innovation comes from. With the dramatic growth in networks and content marketing, authenticity matters. The best artists strive for sincerity, follow their own moral compass and let their work go out into the world for review. Their work is not only original, but also honest and integral to who they are and what they believe in. Picasso’s 1937 mural “Guernica” is an example of authenticity in art. Picasso painted it to commemorate the tragic bombing of a small village in Northern Spain. The chaotic composition, somber black and white tone, and images of fallen people and animals all help Picasso capture the feelings of protest and sadness he felt from the event. Earlier this year, I created a story about LinkedIn’s culture and values. To create an authentic story, I focused on why I was so passionate about the company through the lens of an employee. Like many artists before a new show, I had butterflies in my stomach when I uploaded the presentation on Monday morning.  The response was tremendous and the presentation went viral that morning. When we open ourselves up to genuine expression and put our work out there in the world, we connect more deeply with others and reveal a sense of who we really are. Artists develop their ideas by creating work, not just thinking or planning. They seek novelty in creating new things and when work becomes too routine, they get bored and innovate. They embrace a creative process that is often messy and dependent upon critique. They learn to listen to feedback on their work and continuously improve their work and themselves. This mindset enables them to stay agile and recover quickly. , LinkedIn’s co-founder, refers to this attitude as “permanent beta”,  a lifelong commitment to personal growth. The ability to adapt and the commitment to growth have enabled me to welcome open and constructive feedback. By accepting that I will make mistakes and focusing on learning fast, I have been able to take on and succeed in more challenging business situations. A mindset of continuous improvement allows us to adapt rapidly and create a culture where people are comfortable exploring the possibilities around them, in an authentic way, that will seed our future success. What are some other lessons that you think artists can teach us?"},{"post_categories":["New LinkedIn Features"],"author":"Hans van de Bruggen","title":"Announcing Hopscotch: Your Personal Guide to LinkedIn","date":"August 7, 2013","content":"You're about to get better at using LinkedIn, and you might not even realize it.

I teamed up with Hacker In Residence and UX Designer to create a prototype during one of our company I was approached about applying to the brand new program. The possibility to turn a hack into a real product, with time, space, and executive mentorship from LinkedIn executives , and sounded like an amazing opportunity. I quickly recruited to become a two-man team. We called the project Hopscotch because of how quick & simple (and playful!) it is to hop through a few easy steps. Fast-forward several months: on April 25th, the first Hopscotch tour was launched to introduce the new product and is now available as part of our new unified search experience ( ).

While entrepreneurs are typically trying to get people to invest in their business ventures, interns are doing all they can to get people to invest in their careers. During my summer internship at LinkedIn, I’ve been an entrepreneur in a variety of ways. This approach has helped me to learn, grow, and connect during my time here. There’s a lot of value in thinking entrepreneurially in any setting. Here are a few tips from my personal experience on how to be an entrepreneur in your internship: : Take advantage of what makes you unique and don’t try to fill the same roles as your full-time co-workers. Think about ways you can be innovative in your role and focus on the advantages and different perspectives an intern can bring. During my first week at LinkedIn I met with some people from our Higher Education team to discuss how we could engage students more on LinkedIn. I was shocked at how much my input was valued. My own experience as a college student was insightful and valuable because it gave me a different perspective than the rest of their team. : Social networks provide a great opportunity to build your personal brand, and great entrepreneurs know the importance of managing their online identity. LinkedIn is an especially great way to illustrate what you’re doing in your internship. Use your profile as both a résumé and portfolio by incorporating of your work. Add the section to your profile to better show the range of your experience and interests, and make sure you connect with your manager, co-workers, and other interns in order to build and maintain a network that lasts beyond your internship. : One of the things people love about working for startups or small companies is the ability to have an impact on the direction of the company. But even at large companies there’s room for you to create a niche. LinkedIn, for example, has grown into a 4,200+ person company, but my team is a tight knit group. This has allowed me to take ownership of some large projects and really create my own niche on my team. Regardless of the size of your company, make sure you add value and are able to make an impact with your projects. : Use your internship as an opportunity to learn new skills and test out your knowledge. Working on side projects can be a great way to develop new capabilities and explore other fields or roles within the company. If you realize you don’t like what you’re doing or studying, don’t be afraid to pivot. Use your internship as an opportunity to gain the skills you need and transition to a path that better fits your interests, skills, and goals. Working on side projects and meeting others within the company can be helpful in this transition. : I can’t emphasize enough how valuable it is to have multiple internships that give you varied experiences, perspectives, and skills. In my first internship, I was doing research on snails and spent my days wading through ponds, which couldn’t be more different than my current job focusing on social impact at LinkedIn. The experience of test driving a career, learning what you like or don’t like in a work environment, and getting experience outside of the classroom is incredibly valuable, and I recommend you take advantage of that opportunity as much as possible. You won’t have many more chances to explore different careers when you’re in a full-time job, so try to do multiple internships that allow you to have those experiences. Entrepreneurs recognize opportunity and the value of taking risks. Thinking like an entrepreneur in your internship will help you to , , and . Take advantage of all that the experience has to offer, and keep on being an entrepreneur!"},{"post_categories":["Influencers"],"author":"Itamar Orgad","title":"Engaging in Conversations Around LinkedIn Influencer Posts Just Got Easier [INFOGRAPHIC]","date":"July 30, 2013","content":"Over the past several months, we have added dozens of new on LinkedIn who are regularly sharing unique business insights and starting thought-provoking conversations around issues impacting professionals around the world.

Ironically, I have not felt this good in two years. The last several hours of my Friday were dedicated to reviewing LinkedIn profiles for veterans as a part of at LinkedIn. During LinkedIn’s monthly InDays, employees are encouraged to pursue interests and activities outside of their day-to-day duties, from helping with special projects to volunteering with nonprofits. My name is , and I am a summer MBA intern at LinkedIn developing marketing strategy for the team. I am also a military veteran who previously served in the Army.

We know that making the right connections, keeping in touch with various colleagues and managing your professional brand can transform a veteran’s career. After spreading the word about our offer to give veterans free LinkedIn profile reviews, we soon had over 100 veterans from across the globe sign up.

As tired as I was as the day came to a close, inside I was thrilled. I reminisced back to my time in the Army.

Instead of simply “Student” or “Intern,” use memorable details and keywords that people might use to search for you, such as “Ohio State Marketing Major and Communications Intern at Adobe Systems.” For your photo, post a professional-looking headshot in your best interview outfit. No prom pictures or snapshots with your dog! For the rest of your profile, : Build your Experience section with your current and any other internships and extracurricular leadership positions. When possible, for the work you’ve completed (as long as it’s not proprietary to your employer), such as writing samples, PowerPoint presentations, marketing pieces and videos. Also add optional sections, such as Courses (only including the classes that are relevant to your career), test scores (if they are good!) and Volunteer Experience and Causes. Round out your profile by filling your Skills & Expertise section with the top keywords that describe your skill set. If you’re not sure what to include, scan the internship position description for the work you’re currently doing and the job postings for the entry-level positions you hope to land after graduation. Use the same words (as long as you really possess those skills) as well as other traits you’ve picked up at school, such as writing, research, teamwork and meeting deadlines. Toward the end of your internship, it’s a good idea to ask your internship manager and any colleagues you worked with frequently to write a LinkedIn recommendation for your profile. Recommendations are a great way to highlight your real world achievements and skills, especially if you don’t yet have a lot of experience. Don’t be shy about asking people to mention specific projects you completed, such as a report you wrote or event you coordinated. Future employers will want to see such details of your accomplishments. Finally, now is the time to build a plan for maintaining the great professional relationships you are building this summer. Connect on LinkedIn with your fellow interns (you never know where they may end up in the future), your managers, colleagues and HR representatives or recruiters you have met. If you aren’t sure whether it’s okay to do this, simply ask: “Michelle, I’m really enjoying working with you and would love to keep in touch on LinkedIn when I head back to school. May I send you a LinkedIn connection request?” Then, when you do send the connection request, be sure to customize the note. For instance, “Michelle, thanks so much for agreeing to connect with me here on LinkedIn. Thank you for your support and guidance this summer and I look forward to keeping in touch.” And do keep in touch! Even if you don’t receive an offer at the end of your internship (some companies hold off on hiring until later in the year), make sure to stay on the radar screens of the people you’ve met. Send thank you messages on LinkedIn at the end of the summer with a heartfelt and specific message to each person about how he or she helped you over the summer. You can also post regular status updates, such as sharing interesting articles about your industry (your LinkedIn Today Channel subscription will help you find great content) or mentioning exciting projects you are working on at school. And be sure to “like” and comment on the posts of your new connections as well. If you continue to act like a colleague even when you’re back on campus, you may have the opportunity to become just that after graduation. Good luck!"},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Life"],"author":"Cassandra Brown","title":"Work and Play Can Be Synonymous: A Millennial’s Perspective","date":"July 19, 2013","content":"Millennials can be a tricky bunch. The majority of us were raised alongside our favorite companion, the Internet. This has made us a bit different from other generations. For one thing, we have an addiction to instant gratification (see Instant Messaging and Instagram), but the way we approach work is also different from other generations. According to LinkedIn’s Global Head of Talent Acquisition - Campus, Tey Scott, millennials respond to . Despite our many defining characteristics, what I think really sets millennials apart from others is the way we approach work and how we interpret the phrase “Work Hard, Play Hard”. I started my internship in Recruiting Central Services at LinkedIn with my eyes wide open, ready to learn, and with an ambitious spirit that I could conquer any task thrown my way. I’ve been with LinkedIn for eight weeks now and feel just as energized and passionate about my work as the first day I started. The secret? A variety of projects that allow me to inject my own interests and fun into making them a success. Here are my favorite examples of how I'm able to make work synonymous with play: One of my projects is to curate status updates for engineers who follow our LinkedIn Company Page. My goal with these status updates is to showcase LinkedIn’s culture and passion for engineering projects. My quest for quality content led me to the engineering team’s work space, 7 feet off the ground on an indoor climbing wall. I found this wall while I was on a mission to collect photos from various engineers’ work areas during LinkedIn’s “ ” challenge, an internal competition to see who can decorate their work spaces the best. I heard one of the most epic work environment revamps was by our Distributed Data Systems team, who had gone above and beyond to build a horizontally scalable rock wall. Needless to say, I got a great photo and I couldn’t wait to share it with our members. Another project of mine this summer is producing content for the . My goal is to create relevant, engaging posts that recruiters want to share. What better place to look for inspiration than the king of viral content BuzzFeed? With my manager’s support, I reached out to a few of their writers to learn how they create engaging content. While the recruiters who read our Talent Solutions Blog aren’t necessarily looking for headlines like “21 Best Tumblr Reactions To ‘Game Of Thrones’ Red Wedding”, finding out how BuzzFeed writers collect content and tap into the psyche of their readers is useful for any blogger. I never would have thought that my (I’ll say minor) addiction to BuzzFeed would contribute to a project I was working on during my internship, but I was happy it did. Many undergraduates look for an internship that will look good on their LinkedIn profiles and resumes, while also giving them the ideal “work hard, play hard” balance. This summer, I was fortunate enough to find that balance during my internship at LinkedIn. This post might be completely against anything we’ve ever learned in school, but work and play can be synonymous. During your internship approach each task with an open mind – you don’t always have to take the standard, run-of-the-mill steps to getting things done. In the end, you will actually be more successful if you find passion in the way you perform the necessary tasks to deliver on your projects. At a place like LinkedIn, I can be successful in all of my projects in any way I choose. I can bring the things I am already passionate about to work with me every day, and that is truly what the work/play balance is all about."},{"post_categories":["Infographic","LinkedIn Talent Solutions"],"author":"James Raybould","title":"Top 10 InDemand Tech Startups: Launching the Next $1B Rocketship [INFOGRAPHIC]","date":"July 22, 2013","content":"If managing a hyper-growth tech startup in Silicon Valley is , then the fuel is a mix of venture capital funding and engineering talent.

It’s hard to pin it down, but you know it when you see it. Inspiration adds joy and meaning to the process of creation, whether you’re producing an aria or a PowerPoint presentation. Sounds simple enough. So why is it that some of us are visited by only rare and fleeting spurts of inspiration, while others seem permanently driven by a grand sense of purpose? The answer may lie partly in demographics. showed that women under age 29 tend to feel less inspired in general than their male peers, but that changes as they age, with women older than 65 feeling considerably more inspired than men. What line of work you’re in also seems to matter. Creative jobs or jobs in the public interest tend to inspire people more than others, with professionals in fine arts, religious institutions and non-profit management rating their inspiration highest. So what do you do if you fall into one of those less inspired groups, or you’ve found yourself in an unenthusiastic spell at work? One option: Turn to the 60 LinkedIn Influencers who contributed their thoughts on inspiration for this month’s feature series, We’re always curious about how business heavyweights and industry thought leaders find and maintain their success. What we found after thought leaders across industries weighed in, is that consistently productive people know that they can’t wait for the perfect moment to get work done, so they keep symbols and ideas close to them that keep them motivated. The sources of those ideas vary widely, but virtually no one in the series disputed the importance of being inspired. For some, inspiration is a memorable phrase, for others, a jarring or enlightening experience. Still others find inspiration in a key individual or group of people in their lives. Some found themselves turning back to the same work of art, piece of literature or dramatic moment again and again to re-ignite their drive.

It’s an Irish name as I was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland. Needless to say, I can count the number of times it’s been correctly pronounced on two hands. For the past few years, I’ve been traveling almost non-stop for my job at LinkedIn, a position I couldn’t have imagined being in right out of college and one that is just about as unique as my name. At LinkedIn we talk about “transformation” a lot. It’s one of our core values, and true to LinkedIn form, my career has been completely transformed. Two years ago, I was finishing college at University College Dublin with plans of traveling the world after I graduated. That plan was diverted when I decided to attend an internship fair where I found myself talking to several lovely people from LinkedIn. Two months after the internship fair, I secured a graduate with LinkedIn working in the Dublin office under the most fantastic manager anyone at my career stage in life could ask for. She treated me like a full time employee, had me owning projects and gave me real responsibility. When I started at the end of May, the team was in the middle of preparing for LinkedIn’s first customer conference in Europe called . I hadn’t been at LinkedIn more than a few weeks when I found myself working with some of the top executives (including our CEO ), organising accommodation, merchandise and much more. It was such an exciting time for me. I was working in Dublin and regularly flying to London in preparation for Talent Connect, which included doing tastings, attending fancy parties and meeting a ton of inspirational people. For the next seven months, I found myself working in different areas of LinkedIn, ranging from events, student initiatives, case studies, localisation, and sales. In January 2012, seven months after I started my internship, I was brought on to join LinkedIn as a full-time employee, in charge of running the , educational seminars for prospective clients in EMEA. I managed more than 50 events across 30 cities in Europe. I took more than 70 flights across the world. I technically still lived at home with my family, but actually lived on a plane. During that time, I got to know all the sales teams from the different offices inside-out and was treated like family in every office I worked. From the Dutch team with hugs and kisses to the Irish and UK teams bringing me out for dinner after each event. That year, from August to December, I was traveling to about two cities per week, doing my best attempt to speak multiple languages. It was an amazing experience for me; this was, and still is, my dream job; managing events and traveling the world at the same time. I was 22-years-old and had achieved my dream job. My friends laughed wondering where in the world I was and my granny would tell her Bingo friends about my travels, and I was traveling in disbelief that this was my life. It was surreal. It’s now halfway through 2013 and I’ve relocated to the LinkedIn London office where I get to continue doing what I love to do at a new office in a different city. This year, I am one of the organisers of , the event I was helping with when I first joined LinkedIn as an intern.

Collaboration, one of our cultural pillars, routinely manifests itself both inside and outside of the office. In June, the LinkedIn Sales team in London embarked on “Probably The Toughest Event on the Planet” - Tough Mudder. Tough Mudder is tough because it's 20 kilometres through mud and obstacles designed by British Special Forces to test stamina, strength and teamwork. The LinkedIn \"Legends\" team of 20 was formed through a mixture of volunteering, coercion and peer pressure. The team included participants with a range of abilities, but all shared the common goal of testing their determination to succeed. We chose this event in particular because of the pledge that all runners must take, both in writing and verbally on the start line - \"I understand that Tough Mudder is not a race but a challenge. I put teamwork and camaraderie before my course time. Tough Mudders are team players who make sure no one gets left behind\". So on a warm summer's day in the English countryside, we pulled on our Legends t-shirts, got pumped up together as a team and took our pledge on the start line. We captured the moments on our GoPro cameras and you can see our highlights video here... After 4 hours, 13 miles, 20 obstacles, 4 dunkings and 2 electrocutions, through exhaustion and injuries, all 20 of us made it across the finish line. And we crossed it together as a team. As a Sales leader at LinkedIn, I am focused on inspiring my team to reach a shared objective while upholding our culture and values. During Tough Mudder, everyone did that job.

I joined an incredible team and quickly immersed myself in the world of technology, sales, and social media. My internship offered me an inside look at how LinkedIn has transformed the recruiting industry for professionals. It also provided me with the opportunity to work closely with several Account Executives on various projects and initiatives, building strong relationships that would last beyond the summer. Fast forward 9 months. As I was wrapping up my spring semester this year, I was offered the chance for a second summer internship with the Talent Solutions team - an opportunity I couldn’t let pass. I valued being a part of a company that continues to transform not only the recruitment, networking, and online media, but also the people who work there. As I counted down the days until the start of my internship, I wondered if my second summer at LinkedIn would feel any different. With no first week nerves, I was able to pick up right where I had left off. I was growing professionally, and still am each day. Luckily, my growth seems to be coinciding with LinkedIn’s. Over the course of a year the company has , and our employee base continues to rapidly expand. Linkedin’s growth is a result of innovation, driven employees, and passionate leaders with a strong vision. For college students like myself, growth comes from our academic and professional experiences with teachers, classmates, co-workers, managers, friends, and family who support and teach us every day. Each year we learn more, gain more professional experience, and consistently change in our own way. One of the more important ways I grew as an intern was that I learned to look for solutions to problems on my own first. Before approaching my manager with a problem, I would try and find a solution for the situation. I learned to apply this way of thinking while interning at LinkedIn and it has served me well ever since. For instance, during a project I was working on that had me conducting analysis of over 100 accounts for our Account Executives, I quickly learned that it was inefficient to send an email each time I discovered a problem or mistake. Instead, I found waiting until I’d gone through all the accounts to send a prioritized list of the discrepancies was a much more efficient approach for myself and my co-workers. Also, I learned that I would only grow by asking for feedback on my work. It’s the best way to learn what I was doing right and what I could do to improve. I made it a habit to ask the people I worked with how they preferred information and reports, and adjusted my work to fit their needs in order to have a greater impact. By doing this, I showed those I worked with that I’m an asset and by doing so gained their trust and was asked to help out with bigger projects and sit in on important meetings and calls. My time at LinkedIn has shown me that the people you work with are your greatest asset. I cannot say enough about having a manager who was willing to take the time to teach me valuable skills, help me grow, and develop my professionalism during my internship. My manager and amazing teammates were not only instrumental in teaching me about sales, but also the value of teamwork and how to succeed together. Last summer, my manager had me interview about twenty different people across departments and offices to learn what they do and their own professional experiences. It’s amazing how much you can learn about someone over a cup of coffee - their experience and advice was priceless. For anyone who is currently looking for an internship, my advice is this: choose your internships carefully, know the values of the company, make sure you believe in the products and mission, then commit to learning as much as you can. Find a great mentor who will help coach you through your transition from student to professional and never stop growing. You may have some growing pains along the way, but if you are lucky like me, you will have mentors, managers, and teammates to help you through it."},{"post_categories":["Infographic","LinkedIn Talent Solutions"],"author":"Brianne Shally","title":"5 Global Recruiting Trends To Help You Land Your Dream Job [INFOGRAPHIC]","date":"July 15, 2013","content":"The recruiting world is changing fast - recruiters are becoming more social, mobile, and data-driven.

For me, that meant lazing in the sun reading a great book. As I’ve grown older, summer still feels like the season of reading. And that doesn’t necessarily mean a straw bag full of “beach reads,” like suspense novels and fashion magazines (although there’s nothing wrong with enjoying a few of those). Summer can be a great time to fill your brain with business, particularly if you’re involved in a job hunt. Reading can help your job hunt and career in numerous ways: To help you achieve these outcomes and others, here is your unofficial LinkedIn summer reading list, including four books, two blog posts and an ongoing daily assignment: by Seth Godin This book by marketing guru Seth Godin gives unique advice on how to view your career in today’s constantly changing world. According to Godin, a linchpin is “somebody in an organization who is indispensable, who cannot be replaced—her role is just far too unique and valuable.” Read this book to discover how to position yourself as a “linchpin” to potential employers. by and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha, both successful start-up entrepreneurs, advise individuals to treat their careers like start-up businesses. This means investing in yourself, taking risks and doing quite a bit of hustling. Read this book to rethink your overall career strategy and learn how to build a professional network that will help you make things happen. by According to “introvert spokesperson” Susan Cain, there are far more introverts in the world than you might think. You may be one yourself and, no matter what field you work in, you will certainly have introverts in your network and as colleagues in your next job. In fact, you’re probably interacting with introverted recruiters and interviewers as we speak. In this book you’ll learn what makes introverts tick, and most important, how to communicate better across personality types. by Never Eat Alone, written almost a decade ago, is still my most recommended book on professional networking. Ferrazzi gives specific, actionable tips based on his own relationship building success.  If you don’t quite “get” how to network or you never know exactly what to say when you want to reach out to someone, then this is the book for you. No matter what year you graduated, Chopra’s “seven skills of self-awareness” will inspire you to be true to yourself and forge a career that has meaning to you. Beyond feeling inspired, why not post a quote from this or another to your LinkedIn profile as a way to engage your connections? It’s a simple and positive way to stay on people’s radar screens (Keith Ferrazzi calls it “pinging”) without directly mentioning your job search. When it comes to job hunting, sometimes you have to trust your gut and take a chance. That’s why I love this post from LinkedIn Influencer , about how she broke the rules of cover letter writing -- her “big mistake” -- and landed her dream job. Scan through other posts in LinkedIn’s as well, not only because they share helpful advice, but also because they will remind you to take risks and welcome failure. Risk and failure can often lead to the greatest moves of your career. My final reading recommendation is to continually expose yourself to professional information and ideas that have absolutely nothing to do with your career or industry. Why? Because it will make you different. Because an article about healthcare could spark a truly unique idea in your mind about your field of architecture. Because exposing yourself to a range of topics gives you a different perspective from other job seekers and a much wider world of opportunity. A quick and easy way to do this is by subscribing to LinkedIn’s , which includes smart content on a variety of subjects. When it comes to any blog posts you read on LinkedIn or elsewhere, be sure to check out the comments beneath them as well. While viewing the comments of other readers, you may come across someone you want to reach out to, perhaps a recruiter or another professional in your industry. As a subscriber, you can do this through an InMail message. When you reach out, be sure to relate your message to the article where you found the person’s comment. This will help establish rapport and lessen the potential awkwardness of reaching out to a stranger. Check out the person’s full LinkedIn profile as well to see if you have anything else in common. And then write something like this: It’s also, of course, a wise move to comment on articles yourself. You never know when a recruiter or contact might reach out because he or she was impressed by a smart observation or suggestion you shared.

Today we are introducing two new features to add to your productivity toolkit: “Who’s Viewed Your Updates” and “You Recently Visited”. Both features can be found on the right-hand side of the Homepage and both are intended to provide you with more personalized insights on your activities and engagement across LinkedIn. Who’s Viewed Your Updates provides you with one simplified snapshot of what you’ve shared over the past 14 days, who has seen it and how it has been received (liked, shared).

With grassroots efforts and sheer determination, we worked day and night to hire 45 brilliant interns within four months for our engineering and data science teams. The interns’ arrival infused energy across our company that blew us all away. They arrived bright-eyed - full of enthusiasm, insightful questions, and new ideas that amplified the buzz around everything they were building. They even . The teams were so impressed by our inaugural class of interns that they signed up for 85 interns the following season in 2011, nearly doubling their request from year one. Then in 2012, we hired 200+ interns with new teams jumping on the bandwagon of university intern talent from sales to marketing to legal. This year, we’ve expanded globally to Europe, India and Singapore. To see our internship program grow and expand globally these last few years has been a wild ride, one that I feel incredibly lucky to be a part of. The ability to design the program from scratch with highly invested stakeholders was both nerve-wracking and thrilling. With each internship season, we look for students with a passion for entrepreneurship, who are scrappy problem solvers, and who are ignited by our mission to connect the world’s professionals to help them be more productive and successful. When intern candidates understand at the core what LinkedIn’s impact is on society, that our vision is to create economic opportunity for every professional in the world, we know they care about what the company does, what the company stands for, all of which makes them better at what they do. From the start, we knew we would differentiate ourselves in the candidate’s experience, both during the recruiting process and during their tenure with us. We took the time to understand our interns’ interests and aligned them to the appropriate teams. We held a sincere interest in each individual to ensure that their time with us was time well-spent. To our campus recruiting team, our interns aren’t just talented students; they are individuals with unique personalities, endearing idiosyncrasies, and rich life stories.

That was the elusive prize they told me I couldn’t have. The conventional wisdom went: They don’t hire freshmen as interns. Even more discouraging was the belief that the most highly desirable internships only went to rich upperclassmen whose parents were “somebody who knew somebody.” This only made me more determined to fight the old Conventional Wisdom. Look, as college students, we’re bombarded with scuttlebutt on how competitive the job market is in the Real World. We’re immersed in the horror stories of crippling student debt and diminished career prospects for us future college graduates. So in March, I set my mind to overcoming the Freshman Factor and finding a meaningful internship. But how? As a freshman at , I quickly learned how fiercely loyal the ‘Nova Nation is. Having met many ‘Nova alumni at various events, I always came away impressed by how passionate they were about their alma mater and helping fellow Villanovans. So I decided to create a LinkedIn ad campaign about . . . well, about me. The first order of business was to immerse myself in all the jargon of advertising on a social media platform.  I became conversant with things like clickthrough rates, cost per click, conversion tracking. . .   Honestly, it was actually kind of a cool adventure, learning about marketing in the new millennium. New media platforms like LinkedIn allow the user to narrowcast and really zero in on your true target audience in a very cost-effective way. How cost effective, you might ask?  Well, I decided to commit $200 of last summer’s lifeguarding money to my campaign, just to see how it would go. I used geographic and education filters to narrow down the ecosphere of LinkedIn’s 225 million users down to an audience of just 14,781 individuals – all of whom were Villanova Alumni from New York and Pennsylvania working in my specific fields of interest. The ad that popped up for the ‘Nova alumni using LinkedIn during the month of March informed them that a “dynamic, motivated, and dedicated” Villanova student was seeking an internship. If a ‘Nova graduate clicked on the link, a blog page popped up where I made the impassioned pitch for myself. I clicked the APPROVE AD button on the console, and drew in an anxious breath. How would the ‘Nova Nation respond to an admittedly self-promoting freshman who was shamelessly playing off their loyalty to the school? Well, I must admit, I was blown away by the positive response. From Day One, the encouraging emails poured into my Yahoo! email account, complimenting me for my creativity and determination.  Shortly thereafter came the requests for my resume. My current version was out of date, so I raced over to the Villanova Career Center for assistance. Not only did VCC’s help develop a sparkling, brand new CV for me, but he wisely helped me update my LinkedIn profile. Four weeks later, when my campaign concluded, my ad had been seen more than 120,000 times. Interestingly enough, 48.4% of who who clicked on my ad were senior executives. Most importantly, I was contacted by dozens of Villanova alumni from firms such as Citigroup, Thomson Reuters, New York Stock Exchange, Bloomberg and Pfizer. I even had the opportunity to submit for MasterCard. Not all of the companies had open internships for freshmen, but all promised to stay in touch for next year. After several interviews and offers, I accepted a summer internship with , a digital media technology and custom creative services company that specializes in financial services in Manhattan whose founder/president, , was a member of the Class of 1994. I’m now in my second week on the job and, yes, I’m absolutely loving it. Commuting into Manhattan every morning from Connecticut gives me a lot of time to think about what the future holds. I’m not sure exactly what path my life will take, but wherever I wind up, I look forward to the day where I will have the privilege to provide an internship for some other hungry college freshman. There are no shortage of naysayers who tell you something can’t be done.  Well, to them, I say my experience is proof-positive of the power of social media. It is indeed a brave new world, and it’s exhilarating to be part of it."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Sachin Rekhi","title":"Your Professional Network is Integrating with OS X Mavericks","date":"June 11, 2013","content":"During yesterday’s keynote at in San Francisco, Craig Federighi announced that LinkedIn will be integrated into the newest version of OS X, called OS X Mavericks.

After reading yet another article about the importance of establishing this magical equilibrium I took the concept to my office. I walked the halls asking the very question that was making headlines, “Are you balanced?” The responses ranged from, “I brushed my teeth in the car this morning” to “My kid called his sitter mama.” Childless and ambitious, I decided that balance is bu*#@hit. That was until about two years ago when I had my son and started to understand what all the rage was about. I have officially joined the more than 60% of women across the United States surveyed in LinkedIn’s What Women Want at Work study who identify work-life balance as the most important factor when defining personal success. Over the course of the last five to ten years women have come to believe time is worth more than money and that power is being able to choose your own schedule. Flexibility is the new currency for women in today’s marketplace. And beyond identifying employers who get the fact that you are more professionally productive when you’re able to tuck your kids in at night, you care about and even get to the gym every now and then, LinkedIn empowers you with ways in which to work more productively and create more balance in your life. Here are four ways to build a little flexibility into your career. Build a Name for Yourself. In this day and age of 24/7, you don’t actually have to be awake for it all if you build yourself a professional brand that works for you while you’re visiting your best friend or at your kid’s soccer game. With more than 225 million members on LinkedIn, you can bet that before a new client gives you a call or an executive loses a night’s sleep because they’re desperate to fill an accounting position, they’ll be searching for you. in its entirety, including videos, images and presentations of your work, and make sure you take credit for all the you’ve attained over the years (including those years you were fundraising for the PTA). The key to working the hours you want is to make sure your professional brand is available—even when you’re not. Be Heard. Speaking of your professional brand and how to leverage it when you’re at a spin class, use LinkedIn to build a voice when you’re not available to chat. Invest a few hours every week contributing your opinion and expertise in and sharing interesting articles, quotes and professional accolades (both yours and others) with your connections. Another way of being heard is to ask another member to extol your professional prowess. not only save potential employers time but it’s one of the most effective ways of getting noticed. Be Informed. This isn’t the most politically correct thing to say but it’s true. Flexibility is often seen as a prize— something that you need to prove to your boss that you deserve. The quickest way to demonstrate your productivity in order to leverage it for flexibility is to be in the know, to front run industry trends and to be able to find affinities to build meaningful connections. Before a meeting, look up the  profile of the person you’re about to meet, and you’ll be one question further away from “Where did you work before this?” and one step closer to “Do you keep in touch with John Smith? I hear he just accepted a huge position at IBM.” LinkedIn is your one stop shop for the content you need to be the smartest, most prepared, most productive professional you can be. Don’t Reinvent the Wheel. I’ve had this concept down in the world of career for many years now but it wasn’t until I recently had to tackle a challenge regarding my son that I really understood the power of learning from others in order to gain expediency. There were a few moments when I wondered if I was doing a disservice to my son by not doing the research myself (what I’ve heard many women say in regard to building their careers) and what I’ve discovered is that the more efficient I am about discovering what I need to know, the more time I get to spend with my son. The exact same concept applies to your career. If you want to build flexibility and balance in your career—if you need to spend your time taking risks and being innovative so that you are at the top of your industry (which leads to even more flexibility when it comes to your schedule) get access to the information that’s readily available and build upon it. If you have a career goal and aren’t sure how to get there, take a look at the trajectory of the career of someone who is where you want to be, find mentorship in Groups like and ask questions within .

To experience our people at the finish line, to have them proudly tell me how they ran faster than they thought they could; that they ran the entire distance and didn’t stop once; that they missed their goal but are determined to continue to work so that next year they will beat their goal. Here are snippets of two emails I received after the race that perfectly sum up why Bay to Breakers means so much to me personally. “I broke my personal best by 6 minutes. I had not done any running/training besides the InShape class, looks like it really paid off.” “This is the first time I've ever run this race, and the first time I've ever done more than 5k. I had a blast, and I never would have done it on my own.” Quite a day!"},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Life"],"author":"Danielle Restivo","title":"Lunch Time is Sacred: Valuable Lessons Learned from Working in Brazil [SLIDESHOW]","date":"May 24, 2013","content":"When I told my Canadian colleagues that I had the truly awesome opportunity to work for two months in the LinkedIn Brazil office, they immediately imagined me working on a beach in the hot sun sipping fruity drinks. And who could blame them? I was fortunate enough to leave my home country in the dead of Canadian winter (think -20C/-4F) and travel to São Paulo, Brazil, where I worked for seven weeks at the local LinkedIn office. So I packed my bags, convinced my husband to join me (this was not a hard sell) and left Canada behind for two months. I didn’t expect I’d encounter anything new as it wasn’t my first time in country, but I soon discovered that living and working in Brazil was very different from just passing through. I did not - contrary to popular belief - work while sitting on a beach, but I did learn some valuable lessons that will stick with me. Lunch in Brazil is a serious matter. Unlike North Americans who hurriedly swallow a sandwich while hammering out emails, Brazilians take the proper time to go out for lunch. They step away from their desks, go to a restaurant with colleagues, take time to savour the food and enjoy good conversation while they eat. I’ll be honest - it took me time to get used to leaving my computer behind and sitting down to a meal in the middle of the day. I always felt I didn’t have time or I’d be missing out on something important. But you know what’s important? Eating lunch. Chewing. Taking a break. I soon began to appreciate just how vital this midday meal is. I also got to know my LinkedIn Brazil colleagues much better, and they me. I moved my meetings around to accommodate this time and my emails were waiting for me when I returned. After my time in Brazil, I look at lunch in a whole new way and plan to teach my other international colleagues about its benefits. How well do you listen when having a conversation with a colleague, friend or family member? Do you ever find yourself half tuned in while you mentally prepare what you will say next? Nothing makes you listen more than when you must comprehend what someone is saying in a foreign language. Even after studying Portuguese for nearly a year, I would sometimes only pick up 60-70% of what someone said to me at work, in a restaurant or just out and about in São Paulo. This meant I had to not only listen very carefully when engaging in a conversation, but I had to play close attention to nonverbal cues so I could pick up on mood, expression and tone. I’ve learned that truly listening requires attention and focus but pays off in better understanding. Traffic jams in São Paulo are epic. It once took me almost an hour to go eight blocks in a cab and combined with often limited mobile access, this could make for very stressful commutes. While at first I felt panic at not being able to work while in the back of a cab, I soon turned that time into what I call useful time. I downloaded several books to the Kindle app on my phone and began reading during each commute to and from work. In seven weeks, I read 14 books (full disclosure: I tend to devour books and read quickly, but still!) and really enjoyed the time to use my brain in a different way. I come from a very affectionate family so when I first visited Brazil I enthusiastically embraced (literally) the culture of kissing with each greeting. For North Americans, this may at first seem a bit jarring but it’s much more than it seems. Brazilians are among the warmest people I’ve ever met and each greeting is a genuine expression of joy (at seeing the person) and warmth (a quick embrace and a kiss on the cheek). I quickly found that each and every interaction I had with colleagues, friends and journalists was instantly made better by a bit of human contact that I rarely give or get at home. I hope the Canadians in my life are ready for this newfound appreciation of mine. Even though I’ve left Brazil behind, it’s left a lasting impression. And if you ever get the chance to work or live in another country for a spell, I highly recommend it as you’ll come back a different - and better - person than you were when you left."},{"post_categories":["Asia Pacific","Member Stories"],"author":"Akshay Chaturvedi","title":"Confessions of a Networking Addict","date":"May 28, 2013","content":"I want to connect people around the world through meaningful conversation. Networking is hugely important in our times. To get a job, to expand your business, to connect with like-minded individuals, maintaining a network of trusted connections is essential. I’ve personally leveraged my professional network at every step of my career since I was a student. I’ve always had a passion for trying and excelling at new things. It was with this enthusiasm that I joined LinkedIn in 2008. This was also the year I became a part of the world’s largest youth organization and began working on an AIDS awareness project, leading a team of 14 international volunteers from 7 different countries. LinkedIn helped me execute my first big assignment successfully. The platform made it easy for me to involve people from around the world, from traveling across India for leadership building sessions to giving advice on managing budgets to securing big ticket sponsorships. By the end of my AIESEC tenure, my LinkedIn network had equipped me with a global network of like-minded and passionate people from across the globe. A definitive professional platform, LinkedIn has helped me succeed in most of my endeavors with its huge directory of professionals all across the globe or what I call the ‘power of my network’. When I started my first job at , most of my team had familiarized themselves with my LinkedIn profile before I started. This was a great conversation starter and I ended up making connections for life. Today, even with my job and hectic schedule at , LinkedIn helps me engage regularly with my old associations. LinkedIn is a life-long support system for a networking addict like me. Currently, I’m working with start-ups, connecting with publishers to get my book published, and planning on networking events for like-minded people – all at the same time! Having meaningful conversations and meeting new people is what I love doing most and hence, LinkedIn is my network of choice to connect with people from all walks of life. I’ve had the opportunity to connect with small time entrepreneurs and big time change makers, mentees, mentors, CEOs, and more. I learn something new every time I engage with someone. My LinkedIn experience has not only helped me enrich my network and professional life, it’s also created a lasting impact for me personally."},{"post_categories":["Editorial"],"author":"Katie Carroll","title":"LinkedIn Channels Now On Pulse!","date":"May 21, 2013","content":"We’ve been busy the past few weeks: not only have we added to our iOS and Android apps, we’ve also been dreaming up fresh, exciting ways to bring you amazing content.

Constantly meeting new people and growing your professional network is crucial to uncovering job leads and building a successful and lasting career. But today we’re going to talk about another important piece of networking that is often neglected: maintaining your connections once you have them. As the old song says, “Make new friends, but keep the old….” You can’t build up a new network every time you look for a job or have a career need; think of your longer-term connections as a deep bench of teammates that – as long as you stay connected – will be your supporters for years to come. Take my friend Jane, who is a master of keeping in touch over time. She is great at forwarding interesting articles, sending congratulations messages when people have good news and attending industry events where she’s likely to run into long-time connections. Recently Jane found herself in a job search and noticed on the of her dream employer that David, a former colleague from a decade earlier, currently worked at that company. Because she had kept in touch periodically over the years, Jane felt comfortable reaching out to David asking for help and he was delighted to introduce her to the hiring manager at his company. Do you struggle with keeping in touch over time? Here are answers to three common questions about maintaining a strong long-term network on LinkedIn: I admit it can be a bit awkward to send a LinkedIn connection request or InMail to a former colleague, classmate or client seemingly out of the blue. But you should do it anyway. Here are two reasons why: First, social media is still a new enough communication channel that people aren’t shocked to be contacted by an old friend who has come across their profile. Second, it’s so important to your job search and career prospects to maintain a strong network that it’s worth a bit of potential awkwardness. That said, you can lessen the potential weirdness of the situation by writing a great “get back in touch” message. Here are the three elements of such a message: 1) Explain how you “rediscovered” the person, 2) Find something relevant to talk about by reviewing the person’s LinkedIn profile (to show that you have a genuine interest in the person and are a mutually beneficial networker, and 3) Tell them a bit about what you’re doing and, ideally, suggest a follow-up conversation during which you can talk about your job search and offer to help your contact with his or her needs. Just remember that this LinkedIn message is a friendly networking outreach, not the time to ask for a job. Here is an example: The best way to keep in touch with someone when you don’t have an immediate need or current news is by giving something to that person, such as information he or she would enjoy, congratulations on a new position or a comment on a discussion or status update that person has posted. LinkedIn co-founder calls this doing “small goods,” and it’s one of the best uses of the site. LinkedIn provides some great ways to spark this type of outreach. First, there is the LinkedIn feed on LinkedIn.com. Here, you can see a stream of what your LinkedIn connections are sharing in their updates and find reasons to reach out. By simply liking an article someone posts, they’ll get a notification which will then keep you on that person’s radar screen. If you’d like to engage the person in a conversation, then use their status update as a reason to reach out with a LinkedIn message. Again, try to offer something of value to your contact. Here is an example: Of course, you should also post your own updates so that your connections have a way to keep in touch with you as well. Just be sure to respond to everyone who makes an effort to reach out, to show your gratitude and maintain the relationships. The new also provides reasons to reach out. Contacts brings together your address books, emails and calendars and will alert you on your connections’ job changes and birthdays. You can also use Contacts to set reminders to follow up. For instance, when someone accepts your connection request, you can set a reminder to reach out to that person in one month to say hello and ask if you can do anything to support that person. Contacts is available on LinkedIn mobile as well, so you can ping your contacts and maintain your relationships anywhere. All of the above tips may seem quite time consuming, but the reality is a “just to be in touch” outreach once or twice a year is usually enough to maintain a professional relationship -- as long as those touch points are genuine and personal (i.e., not a “Hi Everyone!” mass email update). If you get into the habit of wishing people a Happy Birthday on their special day or sending personal holiday greetings in December, that means one additional outreach per person should suffice. What’s most important to remember is to be authentic and generous in all of your networking efforts. It’s not about collecting as many contacts as possible or providing everyone with a weekly update on your job search. Networking is about building and maintaining mutually beneficial, long-term relationships that both sides genuinely appreciate. Good luck!"},{"post_categories":["New LinkedIn Features"],"author":"Amy Parnell","title":"Introducing a New Way to Navigate Your LinkedIn Experience [VIDEO]","date":"May 22, 2013","content":"You may have noticed that we’ve been on a mission to simplify LinkedIn.

We also observed how useful Search was as a productivity tool, and aligned the search box with the results page, for fine-tuned search efficiency. So what has changed? As you explore the new navigation bar, you will notice a few visually striking differences, including a simplified menu of tabs to help you quickly and easily locate the features and content that are of most value to you. We have also moved the search bar front and center to make easier than ever to discover and find what you’re looking for on LinkedIn. We’ve also ensured that your settings and other account options are a click away. Just hover over your profile picture in the upper right hand corner and the drop down menu gives you quick access to your account options, language and settings.

The Dublin-based Talent Acquisition team decided to participate in the Ireland program last year to bring this mission to life in our offices. The JobBridge program was designed by the Irish government to give the unemployed opportunities to gain valuable work experience while retaining their jobseeker allowance to help them find new opportunities. At LinkedIn, we saw this as a chance to give some bright individuals useful experience and exposure to how professionals can leverage LinkedIn. Our first JobBridge interns came on board nine months ago and so far, two have successfully applied for full-time positions at LinkedIn and an additional four more are gaining valuable work experience as JobBridge interns. Here’s what our first two JobBridge Interns have to say about their experience. When I finished college in May 2012 I found it quite difficult to get a full-time permanent position in sales in the technology industry. My background was in metal fabrication and while some skills transferred over, many simply did not. For me, JobBridge was the break I needed to refine my skills and gain new ones in what was and still is an incredibly competitive job market for young people in Ireland. I interviewed with LinkedIn through the program and was lucky enough to be offered an internship on the recruiting team. While I was extremely excited about the opportunity, I still was quite nervous when starting. I didn’t know what to expect. On day one, like most LinkedIn employees, I was handed a laptop and put through 2 days of induction. By the end of it, I had so much new information in my head that I knew I had made the right decision. While on the recruitment team I gained so many new skills, many of which I had never even thought about before, such as screening CV’s and phone interviewing candidates. I also learned how to effectively use the LinkedIn platform and realised that I had been undervaluing its usefulness while I was a student. Six months into the internship, my confidence had grown so much that I applied for a permanent analyst position on the Sales Operations team. I am now delighted to be a permanent LinkedIn employee and am of course incredibly grateful not only to JobBridge but to LinkedIn as well for helping me get to this point. When I graduated with my first class with honors in Entrepreneurship and Business Management from Institute of Art, Design and Technology back in June 2012, I was actively looking for a graduate level job in Dublin. I wanted a challenging job where I could use what I had learned and also gain valuable work experience to kickstart my career. After several months I felt frustrated just waiting for a perfect job. I really needed to do something, so I took a different approach and visited the JobBridge website. I started browsing through the internships looking for a job that I would LOVE to do in any form – be it full-time or internship! I didn’t think twice when I found the Recruiting Associate Internship position posted on JobBridge website by LinkedIn. I admired LinkedIn as a company and human resources was one of the interests I developed in college. After I applied , I attended an interview and was offered the position at LinkedIn for 9 months. From the start of my internship, I was assigned a mentor with whom I worked very closely throughout my all internship. With support and encouragement from all of the recruiting team I was gradually given more responsibilities and was soon searching, approaching and phone screening candidates. And…guess what? A few months after I started my internship, I secured a full-time permanent position working as Recruiting Coordinator with the Human Resources team! When I look back now at the time when I had just graduated, I had big hopes and not that many opportunities. I truly believe that the JobBridge internship at LinkedIn was the opportunity to kickstart my career! ------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"post_categories":["Economic Graph","Influencers"],"author":"Francesca Levy","title":"What New Graduates Need to Know","date":"May 21, 2013","content":"If you suspect that your 20-something employee is sneering at you from behind the stack of copies you asked him to collate, research suggests you might be right. Three-quarters of professionals under age 30 think their skills exceed those of an entry-level job, a survey released today by LinkedIn shows. But workers over 30 were wary of this attitude, saying they doubted the younger generation’s work ethic. Perhaps more shockingly, 64 percent of all adults -- young adults included -- are nervous about millennials leading the workforce. The season for commencement speeches -- the annual ritual designed to bridge this ever-widening gap -- is underway. Typically an admired leader, often with decades of work experience under her belt, imparts wisdom to a crowd of hopeful youth in polyester robes on the day of their college graduation. Dozens of the thought leaders who write original content for LinkedIn have given, or are preparing to give, speeches to colleges, graduate schools and even high schools. Dozens more have ideas about the speeches they’d like to give, or wish they’d received when they were just starting out. They’ve posted their commencement addresses -- real, abridged or theoretical -- . So how are some of the smartest and most successful professionals in the world addressing the fact that new graduates both fear for their future and feel overqualified? Some with tough love. Ciplex founder Ilya Pozin takes on entitlement, arguing that . “Simply having a college degree will not get you hired. We need to break away from this idea,” he says. “In all reality, most employers could care less about your GPA or where you went to school.” And journalist Farhad Manjoo argues that however skilled graduates may feel, if they , they’re in trouble. “Over the last two decades ... writing has surpassed talking as the most important skill in the modern workplace,” he says. Frank Wu, Chancellor of the University of California Hastings College of Law, reminds students : “Even those of you who in fact are at the very top of the curve will find yourself surrounded by rivals who have attained that same status.” But Influencers also came ready with tips and experiences that transcended cliches. Bob Dorf, co-author of the Startup Owner’s Manual, recommends grads ask themselves , including “Am I an extrovert?” and “Can I take a chance on greatness now?” to figure out their post-grad roadmap. Venture capitalist Ann Winblad told graduates that while it may seem their careers will turn on their first job, . “I quit my first job and went from a great salary to almost zero,” she says. “But I now had a really great job and the one I really wanted.” Randi Zuckerberg, founder of Zuckerberg Media, warns to “ ” citing a story from earlier in her career when her excellence at a simple administrative task caused her bosses to pass her over for more challenging work. Wolff Olins CEO Karl Heiselman gives some counterintuitive advice: . “That sounds morbid, but it's actually exciting,” he says. “You've got a whole life ahead of you, so think about the impact you want to make in the world and what you want to be known for.” And as for those fears about entering the workplace? Author, journalist and activist Maria Shriver cautions against , instead recommending a break to pause and reflect. “It’s a race to be next, to be first, to be new. Sorta scary, isn’t it?” She asks. Groupon co-founder Brad Keywell also : “Don’t get married too soon. Don’t choose a career too soon. Don’t commit to a city to live in too soon. Don’t rush it. You have plenty of time.” LinkedIn’s survey showed that most millennials are more interested in pursuing something they love than making money, and that they overwhelmingly preferred startups to large companies. Advocates of that approach include Virgin co-founder Richard Branson, who suggests students find something they love and . “I never had a boss in my life,” he says. Craigslist founder Craig Newmark urges graduates to work for small companies, that encourages “meetings. Lots of meetings, where people will often speak for the sake of being perceived as contributing.” And GE CEO Jeff Immelt , risk-taking and leadership in a speech he gave to the University of Connecticut’s graduate school earlier this month. “We can’t wait for the economy to stabilize. We can’t wait for a time when there is more certainty.” Graduates are often encouraged to do what they love. But Michael Fertik, CEO of Reputation.com, : “The key is to be honest with yourself. Loving something doesn't mean you're good at it.” If, as LinkedIn’s research suggests, millennials have doubts about their post-graduate future, they’d do well to incorporate some of these lessons. But you don’t have to be a new graduate to be inspired by these commencement speeches from the top minds in business, which combine humor, practical insights and a dose of cheerleading. Unlike the speeches in this series, many commencement addresses will be forgettable. An irreverent final word on graduation comes from Buzzfeed president John Steinberg. He says he learned by observing his peers and making mistakes, not by being told what to do with his life. “When you are listening to that commencement speech, and the speaker starts on the whole ‘break convention, pursue your own path’ riff, .\" If you are soaking up Influencer advice on the go, you can also find it on Pulse.

In 2003 I was an MBA graduate looking for a job at a startup and was introduced to through a . Although LinkedIn wasn't hiring people with my background (no startup or technology experience) I did have the opportunity to meet Reid, learn about the business and as a result became fascinated with the social media space. That chance meeting ended up being fundamental to my eventually finding a business development job at a competitor of LinkedIn called . By late 2004, it became clear that Spoke did not have the leadership, product or momentum to compete with LinkedIn. In 2004, I received an InMail via LinkedIn from a recruiter looking for a young and aggressive business development executive at , a rapidly growing social address book company. I took the interview, was very impressed with the team, company, investors and product, and ended up joining the company. In 2006, I decided there was a fundamental shift happening in the consumption of online video and I left Plaxo to start , a video advertising platform. For the first few years we recruited engineers and sales people primarily from our personal network. However, it quickly became clear that we weren't going to scale to 100s of employees on our personal network alone. After a call from an old friend named , I decided to give LinkedIn Recruiter a try. From that day on, LinkedIn has been the primary recruiting tool used by and was one of the best recruiting decisions we ever made. In 2011, I decided that needed a VP of engineering to help us quickly scale from 15 developers to over 100 developers in order to better serve our customers and meet the rapidly evolving needs of the industry. After actively searching for six months, we still had not found the right person for the job. One day, a friend encouraged me to reach out to at , implying that he may be open to making a change. Without hesitation I sent him an InMail and we were chatting on the phone within 24 hours.

Earlier this month, we crossed 20 million members in India. It is humbling to play a part in the professional lives of millions of Indians, helping them be more productive and successful in their careers. Our members have been our motivation since we started operations in India a little over three years ago. Since then, our member base has grown by almost 500% from 3.4 million to 20 million today. To me, however, it is not just about growing our member count but about enabling our members to grow themselves. And members of the “City of LinkedIn India” have done just that. The population of “City of LinkedIn India” is comparable to that of Mumbai’s total metropolitan area and larger than that of many countries. Our diverse member population comprises individuals at various stages of their careers - from students to CXOs at the top of their fields. Their skills range from management to testing across industries, and their locations span Tier 1 metros to rapidly emerging towns. A little known fact is that 80% of our members influence business decisions and a many have high household incomes, making them one of the most influential and affluent audiences on the web in India. Ultimately though, they are connected by a mutual interest in maintaining their professional identity and investing time on LinkedIn to enhance their skills by tapping into the collective wisdom of their professional network. Being a members first company with a vision to create economic opportunity for the entire workforce, helping members get the most out of LinkedIn remains our primary focus. Members can now showcase their professional through rich profiles, leverage in the form of news, opinions & connections being shared by their network, and enjoy this value via our popular new mobile apps. We see compelling stories everyday about how members leverage LinkedIn to great effect.

Contrast this with (Chief Creative Officer at Idea Domain) who was well established in his career when he built a strong LinkedIn profile and used it to promote his blog, become a teacher and start his own creative company. Consider (Associate Director, Medicinal Chemistry at Sai Advantium Pharma Ltd) who used LinkedIn to poll a targeted audience in the niche field of molecular discovery and gather their insights, instead of commissioning a primary research study. By doing so, he saved a substantial amount of time & money. Compare that to (Managing Director of ) who started a LinkedIn Group to connect with Chief Marketing Officers to discuss common industry issues and share her opinions.

We had the perfect name already picked out: EatIn. Our hack went on to win the “Best Internal Tool” award – a win at our first hackday! The \"food dudes\" aka the food services team heard about what we were doing and reached out to us to see if we could release EatIn to the company.

They approved our application and welcomed us into the third cohort of the Incubator program. We had 3 short weeks to deliver EatIn during which we learned some important lessons. At the outset of our project, we decided what the main components of the project would be and who would take ownership of each. This allowed us to group related tasks and make accountability clear. This lesson was perhaps most important for us, given our role as interns. Our Incubator project began development in mid-March. At this point, we had 6 weeks before our internship would end, setting a strict deadline on all project milestones. To ensure our project lived on, it was important to be able to pass the torch.

Acquiring devices for testing our mobile applications, procuring a server, and preparing a launch presentation were just a few of the tasks that required cooperation from other people in teams across the company.

Not surprisingly, when this recruiter has a job to fill, he reaches for the smaller stack of referred applicants first. It’s simply more efficient and effective to check out candidates who come with a recommendation from a trusted friend or colleague. So, how do you get your resume into the coveted short stack? Here are some tips: Instead of starting your job search with job postings, start with the people you know. Where do they work? Where did they used to work? Who do they know? What advice and introductions can they provide? The makes this easy by showing you all of the companies (that are currently hiring) where you have LinkedIn connections. Just scroll down the main Jobs page to “Jobs in Your Network” and start browsing opportunities. You can also visit the of the organizations on your prospect list and view anyone in your network who currently works or used to work there. Now it’s time to reach out. Before you apply for any position, try to speak with or have an email exchange with someone who has worked or currently works for the employer -- in other words, conduct informational interviews. Your goal in these conversations is not to ask for a job or even to ask for your resume to be passed along. Not yet. Your objective at this point is to gather information that will help to: 1) give you an edge when you do apply for a position, and 2) build a relationship with the person providing the information so that in the future this person will make a referral. Here is what you might say in an outreach email to an existing connection: Here is what you might say in an outreach email to a friend-of-a-friend (second degree connection): You’ll want to send as many emails like this as possible to increase your chances of gathering good information. Notice how important it is to review each person’s LinkedIn profile before reaching out so you can customize your request and prepare yourself for any conversation the person agrees to. When people do agree to speak with you, here are some questions you might ask current or former employees of your prospect companies: If your contact agrees to refer you or your information to a recruiter, you will want to send an immediate thank you message. Then be sure to keep this person in the loop as your candidacy progresses by providing occasional updates on the process and, of course, another thank you note if you land the job. If your contact is not willing to pass along your resume or LinkedIn profile, that might be a sign to you that 1) your credentials are not a good fit for the organization, 2) this person may not yet know you well enough to make a referral, or 3) this person is just not that helpful (hey – it happens). No matter the reason, go ahead and move on to other prospects. Since no single conversation or referral is guaranteed to lead to a job, you’ll need to continue this process of reaching out to contacts, asking for advice and keeping people posted on your progress. One great new way to keep all of your relationships active and strong is to use LinkedIn’s new feature. Mentions makes it quick and easy to have brief conversations with the people in your network by allowing you to directly reference a contact in your LinkedIn status updates on the homepage. The person you mention will receive a real-time notification, which will keep you on his or her radar screen and promote ongoing discussion – which could lead to an opportunity. You might use mentions to call attention to an article that would interest one of your recent informational interviewees, congratulate a connection on a new job or promote a company’s status update that celebrates an achievement by one of your connections. The goal of using mentions in this situation is to keep in touch with your connections without being overly aggressive. And, as always, remember that the more you help and support people in your network, the more likely they are to want to help you in return. That’s what it means to tap the referral network."},{"post_categories":["International","Asia Pacific"],"author":"Hari Krishnan","title":"Celebrating 1 Million LinkedIn Members in Singapore","date":"April 29, 2013","content":"Singapore LinkedIn members, you’re 1 in a million!

However, as flattering and satisfying as it is to have a new, and perhaps well-deserved, job title, there is much more to your promotion than the title itself. In a recent televised interview with Prince Willem-Alexander and his wife, the Princess were quite explicit with her thoughts on the promotion: “it is not about the title, it is about what we represent”. This applies to us all – royalty or not. Your job title is just one of the many ingredients representing your responsibilities and expertise to the outside world. Therefore, it is crucial to showcase all the important elements that contribute to your role. Provide thorough, accurate information by with precise details. If you're a King, for instance, be specific about the value you add to the country by highlighting your achievements and the skills you've acquired in the years leading up to your promotion. And most of all, clearly express what you’re passionate about. King of the Netherlands is one thing, but being a symbol of continuity and unity says something more. LinkedIn is a social network after all.

Not surprising, of the one million LinkedIn members who have added the to their profile, the majority were Millennials. Why is this important? It’s important because including your social impact as part of your professional identity isn’t just a nice to have, it’s becoming the norm. True story: Two equally qualified candidates were being considered by a CMO for a high level marketing position at a Fortune 100 company. Still undecided, she went to their respective LinkedIn profiles.

Donating your time not only helps charities and causes, it can help you hone your skills. Charitable organizations have been hit with severe funding shortages over the years and can't afford to staff many high skill roles with paid employees.

We were motivated by our own frustrations with mobile news reading: we wanted an effortless experience, with clean design and easy access to all of our favorite sources. As our time in the Launchpad class continued, and as we spent day after day talking to our local community, we realized that this was a shared desire—and we sought to meet their need. It didn’t take long, however, before Pulse expanded beyond its academic beginnings. Suddenly our app was being used by thousands of people and had shot to the top of the App Store; we spent our days at cafes, answering feedback and building upon what had quickly become a much larger vision. We rode the wave of change as news itself transformed, moving from a few trusted sources to hundreds, from ‘news sites’ to blogs and social media, from broadcast to conversation. As the landscape shifted and our community grew, we imagined better and brighter opportunities for Pulse. Thanks to the support of our passionate readers, we realized we could help foster these conversations, build a more informed society, and truly contribute to the world. These three years have been exhilarating and inspiring. We’ve learned about ourselves and our industry, grown our amazing team, and developed a community that we cherish. It’s with this past in mind that we’re proud to announce our next step: Pulse is joining the LinkedIn family. LinkedIn is the perfect partner as we continue our journey. The company shares our passions and values, our belief in the power of knowledge and elevated discussion, particularly for professionals looking for insights to help make them better at what they do. We believe this important step is the key to an even better experience for our community, and we’re excited for what’s to come. With LinkedIn by our side, our team will continue to make Pulse the best it can be. We’re still working together on the product you love, and will continue to provide an innovative and visual news reading experience. For now, , and our two teams are excited to work together to create cool and useful new offerings. To celebrate this milestone, we’re happy to offer a brand new LinkedIn Influencer feed on Pulse, filled with posts by luminaries like Richard Branson, Jack Welch, and more. It’s the first of many opportunities ahead, and we can’t wait for you to see what’s next. Join us on this journey, and help us shape the future of news.

I know firsthand how most healthcare professionals don’t often work a typical “9-to-5” day.

Startup people take pride in building things -- and MBAs aren’t known in the startup world as builders. But that dogma is increasingly out-of-date. As venture capitalist Ben Horowitz, a don of the Silicon Valley engineering culture, , today’s MBAs are less arrogant, and the good ones actually … well, help build stuff. To see what he’s talking about, look around at the LinkedIn job postings on the career pages of the world’s hottest tech startups. Sprinkled between the dozens of engineering roles, you’ll find jobs perfect for humble, talented non-technical MBAs looking to help build remarkable companies. What types of roles are we talking about? Yes, there are product management and business development openings (roles which are both in short supply and have variable meaning). But if you’re an MBA ready to roll-up your sleeves, today there are a lot of other interesting options where your training will be an asset. Here are five examples: - Smart startups are pouring resources into customer service. They no longer look at customers as cost centers. Instead customers -- happy customers, to be specific -- are a means of generating new revenue. They refer new business, and in today’s subscription economy, they upgrade to higher-value services. The analytical, business and communication skills that graduate business programs teach are all critical to providing the services that make customers happy. - Today’s startups have tons of data. With great, data comes great opportunity -- to make better business decisions, to improve the efficiency of the operation, to close more deals, to generate more leads and to understand the customer better. But startups need people to make all this happen. A strong business education can prepare people to do that. - Product marketers are responsible for bringing products to market. They tell the story of the product, both internally to the company’s sales and services team, and externally to prospects and customers. If you can communicate well, create great content, manage complex projects and think strategically about a business, you will excel. - In case you missed the memo, paid advertising is in the midst of a big shift -- a shift from a world where online marketers focused on buying generic impressions that were useless to the buyer, to one where they run highly personalized advertising that’s actually useful to the buyer. Startups need smart marketers who have the business instincts and analytical skills to manage paid campaigns, but also the creativity and curiosity to capitalize on new tools.  - Today’s sales process is becoming far more consultative. It’s increasingly important for reps to understand their prospects’ businesses and begin to offer guidance and value before the sale. Smart MBAs can use their training to offer this kind of guidance in the sales process. Where do these roles lead? All could lead to senior, executive-level positions at large, growth-stage companies, if that’s your goal. They could also prepare you to start your own company. The key, as it is in any startup role, is to be focused on building something your customers love. If that doesn’t excite you, start scheduling the banking interviews."},{"post_categories":["Company Pages"],"author":"Lana Khavinson","title":"Top 10 Tips from Best LinkedIn Company Pages of 2012 [SLIDESHOW]","date":"April 11, 2013","content":"A few months ago, we had the pleasure of announcing the .

Last week, , COO and author of and , Founder & CEO of and Co-Founder of Lean In, joined me for a fireside chat. I have known Sheryl and Gina for years and admire them both personally and professionally. The book is a gift and I recommend reading the whole thing. I was delighted to sit with them to discuss Sheryl’s new book and Lean In, the foundation they created to promote change. Here are a few actionable points from our discussion. : One of the more enlightening chapters in focuses on the inverse correlation between success and likability for a professional woman. Sheryl demonstrates through good argument that the more successful a woman gets, the more she is likely to be penalized in the workplace when it comes to promotions, raises, and opportunities, whereas the more successful a man becomes, the more support he receives. Sheryl gives good tactical advice on being likeable while being successful: ask good questions, smile a lot, and more. Of course ultimately this advice should become obsolete: the culture should change such that a woman shouldn’t have to compensate for or be self-conscious of her success.  : As a man in the business world, I am rarely asked how I balance my professional commitments with my personal life.  Nor has the question of whether I can “have it all” ever been directed my way. Yet women who pursue both a rewarding career and an active personal life as a mother face these questions constantly. The implication is that women must choose one or the other, or else she will shortchange both. Work and home balance is a hard challenge, but the solution certainly begins with finding the right life partner. Sheryl devotes an entire chapter to the topic for good reason: her husband Dave (also a good friend of mine) is fundamental to her success, just as Sheryl is to Dave’s. With a true partnership at home, they are each able to flourish as parents and as professionals. : There are a number of misconceptions regarding , mostly from people who haven’t read the book. For example, some say that Sheryl’s own success somehow makes her message irrelevant to a less successful and less wealthy general population. It’s true that this is a book about the path to leadership – it’s for women who aspire to serious professional achievement.  But in a sense, this criticism validates Sheryl’s underlying point. After all, if Jack Welch had written a book on leadership, would we say it only applies to already-successful people because Welch himself is in an elite orbit? Hardly. More talented women leaning in helps all of us. As Gina pointed out, if women majored in computer science at the same levels as men, we’d solve the engineering talent gap in Silicon Valley. In this way, “leaning in” is at least as important an issue as immigration. Sheryl and Gina founded the to create a community where both men and women can find and offer inspiration, share their experiences and gain access to the types of tools that can help each of us lean in a bit more each day. # I strongly believe we are all better off with more women in leadership roles. Sheryl has started a conversation with about how to do this; now it’s up to each of us to make sure we’re acting on its advice."},{"post_categories":["Member Stories","LinkedIn for Good"],"author":"Caroline Nassif","title":"Meaningful Connections: Joining a Nonprofit Board Thanks to LinkedIn","date":"March 27, 2013","content":"Last year was a HUGE year for me. I got married, finished a big project at work, and became a licensed California Architect after 5 years of grueling exams. As the New Year approached, I mourned the loss of my big goals. I realized that I suddenly had a lot more time, and wanted to do something meaningful with it. I’m sure this is when you expect me to say “LinkedIn to the rescue!” Well, that’s exactly what happened, but not quite the way you might imagine. As a young professional, I had dutifully filled out my LinkedIn profile, thinking that it would come in handy as I sought to expand my professional network. I actually had no idea that LinkedIn could be a resource for nonprofit board opportunities. So when I received an InMail from , the Executive Director of the , about their search for a new Board Member, I was pleasantly surprised. Little did she know I was actually looking for her (inadvertently)! I responded to Terrie and scheduled a time to meet. As the day of our meeting drew closer, I began to get nervous. Was I cut out to be on the Board of Directors for such an amazing nonprofit? Why would they want an architect on their board anyway? The position sounded like it required many years of experience, something I didn’t have. I started to wonder if Terrie had the right person. I looked over my LinkedIn profile again to make sure that it was clear that I am a young professional. Could it be that Terrie really found profile interesting? When I met with Terrie, she explained that she was looking for a younger board member with lots of energy -- someone who could engage with the more experienced professionals on the board and add to their efforts. She also explained that one of their goals is to build a new building: a multi-use homeless shelter, transitional housing, clinic, and counseling center to serve their clients. An architect with my experience could help them as they issued an RFP, refined their building program, and interviewed architects. This was very exciting for me because I immediately saw it as a learning opportunity as well as something I was primed to do from past experience. I had worked for 7 years at an affordable housing architecture firm, and had also volunteered in public advocacy campaigns for similar types of projects in the past. A few months later, after meeting with other board members and attending a board meeting, I was voted unanimously on the board: a match I could not have better engineered if I tried. As I begin my service on the board, I’m excited, honored, and grateful for my new meaningful connection.

It was good to see 74% of women saying “Yes” to that question in LinkedIn’s survey. In our search for happiness we tend to think that “having it all” is the panacea for all of life’s challenges and will magically bring us eternal happiness. This places our focus on external factors that can bring us happiness when happiness is a state of mind and internal. It turns out that the “secret” to happiness and “having it all” lies in effective management of emotions and expectations. So here are some tips for establishing and maintaining emotional balance: A lot of our frustrations and stress are the result of conflict between our emotions, expressions, and actions. So, realign what you say and do with what you feel. It may sound difficult at first, but you can begin at home and extend this to your social relationships and work. This doesn’t mean being confrontational or abrupt, it simply means recognising your ‘self’, individual needs, and emotions and expressing them in a gentle non-offensive manner. Aiming for the impossible is not an act of courage, it simply sets you up for failure and frustration. So re-examine your goals and restate them so they are compatible with your personality and individual needs and preferences as well as your circumstances and resources. Remember you can get to the top of the ladder by climbing one step at a time. Good and bad mood are contagious and self-reinforcing so you can influence your environment and your workgroup. Therefore, establish positive patterns of behaviour to generate positive emotions. You can easily develop many simple habits to surround yourself with positivity and to lighten up your day/mood. For instance, take 2 minutes a day to send an email to share a positive thought or to praise a colleague or someone in your team/organisation, and make it a habit to smile, it is contagious. In the rush of everyday life, we often juggle multiple demands and have to adapt and multitask. However, that a multitasking brain has a harder time falling asleep, and has less energy, and experiences more stress. So take time to relax your mind as often as you can, by refocusing on a single thing. For instance, take 2 minutes to practice deep breathing and focus on your breathing as you inhale and exhale. This slows your heartbeat, relaxes your brain, and reduces anxiety. Social capital and healthy . Therefore, strengthen your social network and build positive relationships. Networks such as can help develop and maintain your professional relationships and help enhance your social capital and career success.

This month, employees in NYC spent a day mentoring college students in the area. It was all part of , a monthly program where LinkedIn employees take a day away from their normal jobs to focus on something meaningful to them. This month’s theme was , which brought us to local colleges in the area. The outcome … well, let’s hear what one of the students had to say, “I just want to thank you and the rest of your team for the session today! I learned a ton and have already taken steps to improving my LinkedIn profile. What you guys are doing is fantastic for us students and I want you to know we appreciate everything you're doing!” is a junior at with a double major in Finance and Information Technology. He sent me this note via LinkedIn after attending the session. Louis came mostly for the free pizza, but also thought he might learn a thing or two. He walked away with a whole new vision about how to connect with professionals in his field of study, build his own professional brand, and leverage LinkedIn to learn more about the IT industry, which he plans to enter shortly. Louis wasn’t alone. LinkedIn employees visited six colleges in the NYC area and spent time coaching and mentoring hundreds of students on how to use LinkedIn to be more productive and successful. Students learned how to create killer LinkedIn profiles, build a quality professional network, join groups, find jobs, and much more. Perhaps the most eye-opening moment for the students was when they feasted their eyes on . They discovered that within mere seconds, they have the ability to search tens of thousands of alumni from their school by where they live, what they studied in school, and most importantly, what they do now. The light bulb went on when they realized that they were just a click and a short note away from connecting with someone who could potentially change their lives. The students weren’t the only ones who benefited from this InDay. Here’s what my colleague had to say about her Mentor[in] InDay, “What a phenomenal experience! The best part of the day was seeing the “ah-ha” moments students had as they realized the potential impact professional networking with LinkedIn can have on their careers.” I’m grateful to work for a company that not only encourages its employees to make a difference in their communities, but actually puts its money where its mouth is by dedicating a full day each month to finding something meaningful to do, and making it happen. Since joining LinkedIn last year, I’ve , learned from some of the and mentored youth groups. Next month, I’ll be beautifying a community garden in Harlem as part of Earth Day.

We asked some of LinkedIn’s Influencers to describe their toolkits for success for “Things I Carry,” For a definitive guide to success, you may as well look to some of the most successful people in business, and it turns out that the hundreds of items named can be distilled into a few categories. To sharpen your daily routine the way these thought leaders have, make sure you have these five things: We expected smartphones, tablets and accessories to make prominent appearances among the 56 posts in the series. But the ways Influencers say they use their gadgets give us a unique glimpse into how they work. Craigslist.com founder Craig Newmark uses a Samsung Galaxy Note for “80 percent” of his work, but increasingly depends on a “Dick Tracy”-esque .  Peter Guber, CEO of Mandalay Entertainment and owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, admits to saying he uses his device for everything from exercising to music to watching the construction of his new Pennsylvania stadium on a live feed. Clara Shih, founder of Hearsay Social and member of the Starbucks board, despite the disdain among Silicon Valley tech hounds for a full QWERTY keyboard. “I stand by my decision,” she says. “I need to be able to quickly hammer out emails and social network posts.” They are among nearly thirty Influencers that called out their iPhones, iPads, kindles, laptops, Galaxys, Droids and other mobile tech tools for their dazzling variety of time-saving apps and functions. I’m sure a handful of them occasionally use their smartphones for making calls, too. Gadgets are by no means the only tools that help Influencers think and create. Eleven described using journals, blank sheets of paper or other analog writing tools as a substitute or supplement for electronics. Despite being a self-described “hardcore technologist,” Asana co-founder Justin Rosenstein says the crudeness of pen-on-paper drawings “Because it’s just an ugly drawing (I have pretty poor penmanship), I can focus on the ideas rather than getting bogged down in the pixel-level details,” he says. About a half-dozen of the Influencers in the series depend on paper journals, many to capture lists of things to do. But one list had a surprising purpose: Shane Atchison, CEO of Possible, carries a list of “Everyone is constantly liking things we post, telling us we’re brilliant, and making us feel good. A list of what you don’t know is a great antidote to this,” he says. I couldn’t resist including this one. While not every Influencer religiously packs a bathing suit -- in fact, only two: , and healthcare and tech investor -- they both describe it as absolutely key. “I never check my bathing suit (and cap),” says Dyson. “I swim every day, so I can’t risk losing my luggage and ending up in some exotic location wondering whether it’s okay to swim in my underwear.” Whitman, too, swims regularly. Both say they need it for focus, discipline, and a clear-headed way to think through complex problems. It’s a great reminder that something that may seem completely unrelated to work can actually be a necessary complement to the professional day. Most offices or cubicles have personal touches like family photos, or gifts from children. But as work increasingly goes mobile, business leaders have taken to keeping personal reminders with them at all times. Sequoia Capital Chairman Michael Moritz calls his weathered leather binder, ink-cartridge pen and nearly half-century-year-old spectacle case Don Peppers, author of “Extreme Trust: Honesty as a Competitive Advantage,” carries for every night he’s on the road. That means for a five-night trip, he finds five dated notes hidden among his luggage. Angel Investor Chris Schroeder carries a small picture of Ellis Island with him everywhere, as a symbol of his family’s history. “It reminds not only of where I am from, but how sheer luck has played an enormous part of my life. And it is humbling,” he writes. Work isn’t everything. The most successful people recognize that, keeping their perspective intact by carrying around a meaningful object that helps them transcend their quotidian concerns. Finally, some of the most important things that can help you become better at what you do aren’t things at all. Influencers gave shout-outs to their teams, co-workers and assistants, even going so far as to say they couldn’t do their jobs without them. Of his assistant Helen, : “Before I ask her to do something, she can read my mind and know what it is I am thinking before I ask.” Michelle Rhee, founder and CEO of Students First and former chancellor of the Washington, D.C. public schools, . “I’ve always tried to surround myself with smart colleagues who challenge me. And when I find people like that, I don’t let them go. Citi Managing Director Linda Descano says that while technology is important, .

You’ll find a slew of unexpected answers to the question “What essential things do you carry?” Here’s a sampling: , a , a , a , a , a , a , , and a . Behind each of these unconventional items is an illuminating, and often surprising story that explains why it’s completely necessary.

Well, what if you don’t currently have a job? What if you haven’t had a job for a long period of time? Don’t despair. It may take some extra effort to land a job after a long period of unemployment, but it is absolutely possible. Here are five Es to guide you: First and foremost, it is a mistake to hope that employers won’t notice that you are currently out of work. A gap in your LinkedIn profile or your resume is certain to raise a red flag. You need to address it directly. Depending on the reason for your time away and your personal comfort level, you can either explain the gap at the beginning of your LinkedIn profile Summary or in your InMail correspondence or cover letters to recruiters when you apply for positions. In whichever place you choose to give your explanation, do it quickly, honestly and positively. Here’s an example if you stopped working because of a layoff: Here’s an example if you stopped working for personal reasons, such as childcare: Next, describe any professional endeavors you have pursued during your time away. This might include volunteer work, part-time work, freelancing, temping or helping out in a family business. When possible, demonstrate how this work is related to your desired career path. Here’s an example of what the laid-off PR professional might say: One of the fears an employer might have about a candidate who is not currently working is that his or her skills are outdated. You can counter this fear by showing that you have maintained -- or, ideally, increased -- your knowledge during your time away. Be sure to completely fill out the . If you are currently enrolled in a class or recently updated a skill or certification, then it’s worth mentioning that directly in your Summary. For example, in the case of the lawyer returning to work after time off with her family, she might highlight the fact that she recently completed her mandatory continuing legal education (MCLE) requirement. The PR executive might include some of his most cutting-edge skills -- perhaps some that he developed recently in his volunteer work -- in his list and invite his connections to endorse them. If you know that your skills are rusty or that a mandatory professional certification has expired, don’t wait for a recruiter to notice. Do your best to get up to speed now, and include your current training or skill building in your LinkedIn profile to show that you are being proactive. It is one thing to promote yourself as a safe bet despite your time away; it is another thing for someone else to say it for you. You can use LinkedIn and as strategic tools to address any concerns you believe an employer might have about your particular situation. In the case of the PR executive, he might worry that an employer thinks he was laid off because he failed in his previous job. To counter this impression, he can from a previous boss, client or colleague to praise his successful results or mention that he survived three previous rounds of layoffs during the depths of the recession. In the case of the attorney, she might fear that recruiters will assume her skills are rusty, so she can list her most cutting-edge skills in her profile’s Skills & Expertise section, which her contacts can then endorse. Finally, it is crucial for unemployed job seekers to . Your best-case scenario occurs when a recruiter or hiring manager meets you or learns about you through a trusted contact before knowing that you have been away from the workforce for an extended period.

At that time, I was in London looking for a new job. Nobody would have guessed then that I would move to Dubai, start my own consulting company and publish a management book about the Middle East. From the moment I joined LinkedIn, I saw opportunities way beyond my job search because I’ve always appreciated and depended on networking with people. Even though the community was still young, LinkedIn enabled me to build a stronger professional network of friends and colleagues. My strong preference for interacting with others has been nurtured because I have dyslexia. A slower reader gets answers faster simply by asking. The handicap was not so bad that it prevented me from being hired by a prestigious management consulting firm and afterwards working for two other renowned companies. It required, however, quite a bit of determination and stamina. A consultant’s need to work closely with many people and sparsely worded PowerPoint slides also played to my strengths. Yet, even today I find it amusing how my career has worked out. What became my last job hunt ended when I was offered a position in London as Director for Nokia Networks’ consulting activities in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. This literally opened up a new world to me. It was obvious that most of the growth in the telecommunications industry would be in the emerging markets. The cultures and business practices in these regions are very different from those in Europe and North America, where I had most of my work experience. I learned that to conduct business successfully, I had to invest time on the ground to understand and build relationships. So shortly after I started this job, my dear wife Ida and I packed and moved to Dubai. LinkedIn was of great help to me when I started doing business in this new place. It helped me to identify colleagues from previous employers as well as other Scandinavians with whom it was easier to get a meeting and help with further introductions. I had always wanted to start my own business, but it was harder to wave goodbye to monthly paychecks and business class airline seats than I had imagined. My resolve to strike out on my own was strengthened by my conviction that most companies miss significant potential by treating business decisions and initiatives separately from leadership development. I noticed the divide between “hard” management consulting and the “soft” fields of coaching and training were seldom crossed. As an exception, I had developed and applied methods to accelerate the performance of organizations that combined these hard and soft skills. I leveraged this insight to strengthen my own organization at what is now but saw much more potential. So in 2011, I resigned when I realized that I would never forgive myself for not grasping this big opportunity. I founded , which is a consulting and coaching firm helping business leaders with strategic issues in which people are the critical factor. To share some of the insights that the firm is building upon, I recently published my first book . A challenge for me is that most companies in the region do not share much information about themselves. LinkedIn became my X-ray by showing me a good chunk of a company’s employees so I get a sense of the size of the company, what the organization looks like and what backgrounds their staff has. I would neither have been able to write the book nor help my clients with the same confidence without a better sense of which companies are the movers and shakers. Over the past 9 years, LinkedIn has really become a trusted companion on my career adventure. Now, I start everyday with LinkedIn as it’s become a valuable part of my morning routine."},{"post_categories":["Product News","LinkedIn Tips"],"author":"Johnathan Podemsky","title":"LinkedIn Search Just Got Smarter [SLIDESHOW]","date":"March 25, 2013","content":"Did you know were done on LinkedIn last year?

Four years ago, I was diagnosed with epilepsy. While it hasn’t affected my abilities, it has meant that I need more flexible working options to accommodate it. My job at the time in Technical Customer Support didn’t offer room for growth unless I could physically be in the office every day, so I started looking for a new career opportunity last year. I found my last three jobs through LinkedIn, so I immediately turned to LinkedIn to . I spent time thinking about what I wanted from my next role and defined this in my Summary and Headline. I wanted my profile to stand out, be succinct, and attract exciting and forward-thinking employers. Rather than duplicate my CV, I used the Experience section to summarize my previous employers, roles, and most importantly my key achievements and impact. Once I updated my profile, I from customers, peers and managers I had worked with in the past. My aim was to gather at least three recommendations for each job and at least one from a customer. In my view, it’s the recommendations that make you stand out from the crowd. These are true testimonials from people you’ve actually worked with or provided a service for. They matter more than a CV, as they are a clear indication of your success, and that’s one of the key benefits of using LinkedIn. I was surprised at how willing people were to write recommendations - many were really happy to write a short note about their experience working with me. It’s easier if you collect these throughout your career so I try to keep mine constantly updated. Shortly after updating my profile, I was contacted by , Co-founder, President, and CMO of , an open-source rich media and video platform. Michal contacted me through a personalized InMail about an opportunity to help build their UK team. Over the next 10 days, I had a series of phone interviews with various department leaders and founders of the company. My final interview was with the General Manager of the Kaltura London office, , who I hit it off with immediately. Throughout the interview process, I was honest about my epilepsy and need for flexibility in my work, which the entire team at Kaltura was supportive of. Next thing I knew, I received a call saying that my application had been successful and that I had landed the job of my dreams in Account Management. Kaltura enabled me to work from home for a portion of my week, which helps me manage my local and international travel. They have provided me with the tools and support I need to grow and succeed in my career. The benefit of using LinkedIn is that my profile has global reach and exposed me to both local and international job opportunities. This isn’t always the case. When you submit your CV to a recruiter, they look around and try to match you with local jobs. When you update LinkedIn, the whole world sees it, so your reach and exposure is much wider. My new role is a big promotion from my last job and is international in scope. I was recently promoted to Director of Strategic Accounts, where I oversee client relationships and projects in the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and Europe. I have the opportunity to work with a wide customer base across industries including education, media and enterprise. I love that my role is customer facing and exposes me to different sectors, cultures, languages, and regions. There’s a huge challenge in keeping a global team working together, but Kaltura’s approach to flexible working, their use of video, VOIP and live streaming, and their open attitude about supporting employee growth and development make it a world-class company to work for. Quite simply, this new role has changed my life. My salary has increased, my career growth path is now excellent, and I’ve never been happier. Thanks to LinkedIn and Kaltura, I was able to overcome limitations to find opportunities I never would have found otherwise."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Life","LinkedIn for Good"],"author":"Hanh Vo","title":"Paying It Forward: Creating Economic Opportunity for Immigrants","date":"March 15, 2013","content":"Imagine if you were transported to a foreign land, penniless, not knowing the native language, surrounded by foreigners who you’ve only seen in fatigues. With just one day’s warning, my mother packed up our meager belongings, my brothers and I who were 7, 3, and 2 years old at the time, and left behind her home and her third child. My parents struggled with the idea of leaving all they had, but they knew that the option of staying was not an option. My father who was a helicopter pilot for the South Vietnamese Air Force would be quarantined in a concentration camp if they had stayed. Saigon fell to the Communists on April 30, 1975. On April 29, 1975, my father flew us out of Saigon while under fire from the Communists. Somehow, we made it in one piece to Thailand. From there, the Americans flew us to Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. My parents didn’t know how they were going to build their lives in this foreign country, but they did know that they had hope. Hope for a better future in the land of opportunity. We were one of the lucky ones. Volunteers, complete strangers from Ramer, Tennessee came to us. Strangers who have never set eyes on Asians before opened up their hearts and gave us a chance -- a chance to make a better life for ourselves in their back yard. With support and encouragement from my mother, my father enrolled into college at the age of 32. He received his Electrical Engineering degree from the University of Oklahoma at the age of 36.  His education opened doors for all of us. My brothers are Chemical Engineers both with MBA’s; my third brother eventually made it to the States in 1990 and doubled majored in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I was fortunate to go to law school, hoping that one day I could help others. When our General Counsel, , asked for volunteers to head up LinkedIn’s pro bono legal program, I jumped at the chance. This was my opportunity to use my legal education to serve the under-served, to give back, and to pay it forward. On an overcast day in March, LinkedIn joined and on the Justice Bus and to work with the in Napa, California. Our mission was to complete the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) forms so that youth immigrants could have an opportunity to become legally employed in the United States.  We met 28 applicants, completed 28 applications, and created 28 opportunities for legal employment. Just like the volunteers I met in 1975 who took it upon themselves to help an immigrant family start their lives over again in the United States, 23 volunteers took it upon themselves to help youth immigrants create economic opportunity for themselves and their families in the United States. I believe that we come to this great nation for economic opportunity and if we are fortunate enough, we may be able to help others become more productive and successful in their careers. 23 complete strangers opened up their hearts to 28 immigrants. At the end of the day, it was not the immigrants who truly benefited from our volunteer service, it was us."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn for Students","Featured"],"author":"Sohan Murthy","title":"Picking Winner of NCAA Basketball Tournament Using LinkedIn Data","date":"March 18, 2013","content":"The Madness has finally arrived!

Gavin is on a mission to change the mindset of how people view government. The themes in his book are clearly striking a chord across partisan lines. The notion of individual responsibility and citizen empowerment are commonwealth ideals. They also provide some common ground for me to have a productive conversation with my libertarian father when home for the holidays! I had the opportunity to interview Gavin, a master storyteller with examples that illustrate the themes in his book. I strongly recommend you read his book and watch the full interview below – both are well worth your time. Here are 3 of my favorite themes: I was keenly aware that the United States is due for some upgrades when it comes to technology and government. What I was startled to learn is just how far behind we are relative to many countries around the world. For example, Estonia (which has one of the highest mobile phone penetration in the world), allows their citizens to pay parking meters, parking tickets and property taxes from their cell phones. In the US, the primary area where technology has seemed to keep pace in government is the digital outreach related to campaigning for re-election. There is no question that we need to find ways to inspire our smartest leaders to pursue careers in government but we also need to inspire the private sector to engage in social sector problem solving. One example Gavin talks about is the power of the and the potential to replicate the concept for other challenges. The original X Prize is credited for creating an opportunity for private civilian travel into space. What if we offered a prize for solving malaria or creating a digital voting platform? Or, perhaps my favorite idea in the book to inspire the private sector to get more directly involved in government is creating a for government where government officials post projects they need funding for and citizens fund it. I think it would be pretty easy to crowdfund a major overhaul of the Department of Motor Vehicles. The 405 Interstate in Los Angeles is notorious for being one of the most congested highways in the United States. Apparently, there is a billboard that states: “You are not stuck in traffic” in big bold letters. In small letters at the bottom it notes “You traffic”. This mindset is at the heart of what is facing our relationship with government. In nearly every other aspect of life, Americans take individual responsibility, perhaps because there is monetary compensation attached. I believe we can inspire people to return to the mindset of our founding fathers and “Act like an owner” when it comes to solving some of the most intractable problems we are facing.

That's in large part due to the people who work here who, in addition to their day-to-day jobs, strive to better themselves, their communities and the world. And I couldn't be more thrilled that LinkedIn supports some of their efforts via the Transformation Grant program. Transformation is the most important tenet of our culture at LinkedIn. In 2011, we launched the Transformation Grant program to bring this tenet to life. Grants are annually awarded to LinkedIn employees in support of their efforts to transform themselves, their families, their communities, and/or the world. In 2012, grant winners embarked on life-changing trips that involved building schools, helping family members, teaching programs, etc. Truly inspiring stuff! Most inspiring though is that most of the grant winners were already embarking on these paths. The grants simply amplify their efforts. I’m pleased to announce this year’s 12 Transformation Grant program winners. These employees were chosen from more than 60 submissions received across functions and continents, and ranged from transforming families to putting small dents in major world issues – like education or hunger. Twenty-four finalists were selected from the 60+ submissions to present to a panel of five judges. They each had roughly three minutes to give their elevator pitch and answer questions. I had the pleasure and challenge of being a judge and was inspired by how passionate the finalists were about their causes. To all who applied, we’re proud to call you colleagues and friends.

We asked these very questions (and more) to thousands of professional women around the world to better understand the challenges women face in their careers, what success means to them now and how that’s changed over the past 5-10 years. While some stark differences emerged by country, we uncovered some key global trends. Today, almost two thirds of working women say that success is about achieving the right work-life balance. This is a major shift from 5 to 10 years ago when ‘salary’ topped that list along with an ‘interesting job’ and ‘responsibility’. Interestingly, work-life balance wasn’t really on the radar then. These findings emerged from our ‘What Women Want @ Work’ study, released today in celebration and support of on March 8th. So what’s changed? The upheaval of the global economy has meant fewer staff and resources so we all have to do more with less. The other major factor has been the growth and reliance on technology. We increasingly operate in an ‘always on’ work environment where many of us can’t resist starting and ending our days on our smartphones. The line between work and home life has blurred as technology has become systematically ingrained in our lives. All of this seems to have contributed to women taking stock and reassessing what’s really important to them. Not surprisingly, our study tells us that working women the world over are looking for one thing above others - greater flexibility. As a working mum of two little boys, I know only too well what a juggling act it can sometimes be. Two out of three of working mums we surveyed agree and ‘would like more flexible work conditions’. Furthermore, there is a strong belief that for the next generation of professional women greater flexibility will be crucial for their success – a whopping  4 out 5 agree with that sentiment. Other big issues that the study surfaced included concerns over lack of investment in professional development and lack of a clear career path. Encouragingly and despite all this, there is a great deal of confidence and optimism about careers and future opportunities – with 3 out of 4 women believing they can ‘have it all’. Perhaps that’s what women really want. So where can professional women turn for support? As the world’s largest professional network, LinkedIn is a great place to start. So what do YOU want at work?

In 2005, I received so many invitations from friends that one day, I finally decided to take the plunge. Unbeknownst to me, this was the best decision I could have made as a recruiter, and it is the best decision you have made as a job seeker. There are 200 million LinkedIn members (and growing), but this doesn’t mean there are 200 million expert members looking for jobs. Here are 5 ways to stand out from the crowd and win the hearts, minds, and attention of top recruiters. Back in 1997, I rode the NYC subway with a pile of faxed and mailed in resumes in my hand every Monday evening. I would screen them one by one, hoping to find the perfect candidates to show my hiring managers on Tuesday morning. Keywords barely mattered back then. Today, they are practically the only thing that does matter. Why? Because recruiters start by running searches for candidates, and they can only find you by the skills you’ve listed. Being concise is good, but not at the expense of completeness. You can find the appropriate keywords from job descriptions that you apply for. Make sure you mention them.  Some repetition is fine, even helpful - especially if multiple positions have involved similar skills and duties - but remember that a human will be reading your profile at some point. Avoid obvious ‘keyword stuffing’, as it will undermine your credibility. Here is an example of how to incorporate words artfully: “Developed presentations for the Board of Directors” “Responsible for creating decks” Even if you’re not job searching now, many recruiters build a ‘pipeline’ of future candidates, and it’s good career sense to be on the radar of as many recruiters as possible. Your LinkedIn profile will more than likely be viewed, reviewed, and compared with your resume. Don’t get tripped up by creating confusion or mistrust in a recruiter’s busy mind. Here’s a simple rule: Be sure that the and match. If they don’t, you may fail to meet expectations on the core requirement of integrity. Recruiters hate having to withdraw offers from candidates when everyone in the company has fallen in love with them. It’s true that many job search experts encourage job seekers to create different versions of their resumes. If you opt for that strategy, ensure the basic facts are consistent. Adding emphasis on certain roles, or certain dimensions of your skillset, can be totally appropriate, but be  transparent. For example, if you have a title that doesn’t match the standard titles in your industry or your actual responsibilities, add an explanation in parentheses. For example: Vice President, Marketing (Acting in Marketing Manager role) Director of Finance (independent contributor) Office Manager (also responsible for Human Resources) In the same way that you would not go up to a stranger and ask them to hold your hand without having gotten to know you first, one of my pet peeves is when people send LinkedIn invitations without personalizing them. In other words, just because some of us are open networkers, doesn’t mean that we don’t want to know how you learned about us. Customize your invitation when you ask people to join your network. Include how they know you, how you can help them by being a part of their network, and/or how you hope to work with them in the future. On LinkedIn, if you have fewer than 50 connections, you simply need to find more. A large network gives you visibility of more profiles (up to your 3rd degree with a Premium subscription). Therefore, you’ll have a greater chance of seeing the name of the hiring manager or recruiter at a company you’re interested in. You probably have more potential connections than you think - try listing out all the people you knew at your former companies, your bowling team friends, and your college classmates. As mentioned in #2, you should expect a recruiter will try to research you on LinkedIn. Make it easy! Neglecting to include the link to your LinkedIn Profile on the top of your resume could lead to mistaken identity. For example, if your name is Steve Smith, there are hundreds of your namesakes who live within 50 miles of New York City. A link on the top of your profile will send the recruiter straight to not only your background information but also to your endorsements, recommendations, honors and awards which can send you straight to the top of the pile. When you sign up for LinkedIn, you are automatically assigned a Public Profile link for just this purpose. The default link includes your name plus a set of randomly generated numbers by the system, for example, . The Public Profile to just include your name instead of a bunch of numbers, and it will be much more appealing to a recruiter. If your name is popular, such as Steve Smith, you may have to be more creative as there are many of you out there. You can try adding relevant acronyms or adjectives, such as: or for example. While having an unprofessional or inappropriate picture won’t necessarily put you in the “no” pile, it may leave a recruiter concerned about sharing your resume with a hiring manager. A professional photo will give the impression that you are a serious candidate worth evaluating, and . Let’s start with a fundamental point that’s often overlooked: your LinkedIn picture should be of you, not a picture of your family or your dog. Also be sure to represent yourself professionally. Avoid posting pictures where you are staring up into the sky, looking like you’re having a bad day, or clearly in a non-working mode. For example, the picture of you dressed up like Spongebob on Halloween is best saved for other social media sites. A picture is only worth a thousand words if it is high-quality, so consider getting your headshots done at a major retail chain for a low cost. Or, get help from a family member or friend: use a high-resolution camera, and select a neutral background with indirect lighting. Remember to smile! Your picture should exude confidence. Finally, dress for success. Imagine it’s the first day in your new role, and you’re ready to walk through the door. Note this could be different if you’re walking into an office, a plant, a store, or some other work environment. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- According to , 93% of recruiters use LinkedIn to find talent. With those percentages, you simply have to learn to take advantage of the tools LinkedIn has given you. Think of yourself as a recruiter. How would you find yourself on LinkedIn? Then, how would you contact yourself and how long would you wait for a response? When used strategically, you can delight recruiters, and LinkedIn can become the light at the end of the tunnel that you have been waiting for!"},{"post_categories":["Influencers"],"author":"Francesca Levy","title":"Why You Should Pick Up Next Time Mom Calls (and More Great Advice)","date":"February 26, 2013","content":"It’s not always easy to take tough advice, particularly when a family member doles it out.

While your decision to change jobs probably won’t warrant national news coverage, how you handle your last days at your current company can have a lasting impact on your professional reputation. Here are some often overlooked Do's and Don'ts to set you up for a clean, damage-free breakup. You may be absolutely right: your boss is a jerk, your company is mismanaged, your co-workers are incompetent, but now's not the time to point that out.   Keep in mind that while you may be on your way out the door, the person (or even worse, people) you're sitting across from aren't.  The trick is to make the 'I'm leaving' conversation as quick and dignified as possible.   I say quick because I've seen even the most rehearsed professionals stumble with even five minutes too many.  Plus, if your parting words are, \"You're the most incompetent person I've ever worked for,” you can be sure that’ll be top of mind during your reference check.  This is especially important if you’ve been asked to leave.  Repeat after me: Thank you for this opportunity (to learn how I will never, ever manage a team.)  I have learned a tremendous amount (about why you shouldn't take credit for your co-workers ideas.)   While getting all your grievances off your chest may feel cathartic to you, I promise that weeks or months later when you see your colleagues at an industry event, or are sitting across from that former boss in an interview years later, you'll be wishing you reined it in. The world's a small one. While on some level it would feel kind of good to think that we are utterly irreplaceable and that the company will fall apart without us, the truth is the quicker you replace yourself with someone even more stellar than you, the better.  The easier your departure is on your boss the more fondly you will be remembered and, if your replacement is even smarter than you are, you’ll be basking in her glow too.   One of the best things you can add to your  “I'm quitting” conversation is “and I have the perfect person to replace me.” Talk to friends, go out to your professional connections, use an Advanced People Search on LinkedIn to track down the perfect fit. If your announcement is coming as a shock to your boss and you are, in fact, an invaluable employee you can expect shock, fear, (maybe even crying) and almost always a counter-offer.   With promises of how she’ll be better, more supportive, give you a raise, etc., it's a lot like a personal breakup.  While the burn of “I can't live without you” is strong,  the day after you agree to stay, they will be working out their plan for your departure.  Resist the urge to reconsider. Much like a breakup, you want to have your bags (desk) packed, give invested people some warning or at least some recent contact so you can keep the relationship warm, and know where you're going to live (work) before you set foot out the door. Just because you’re leaving doesn’t mean that the company, and those who still work there, are now dead to you. Once you’re gone, continue to post positive stories about your former employers on LinkedIn, comment on others' posts and stay connected to your old colleagues.  Doing so shows that you’re a professional who isn’t shortsighted.  After all, you never know when you might find yourself back there someday—in a much higher position."},{"post_categories":["Member Stories"],"author":"Carri Levy","title":"Using LinkedIn to Change the Lives of Patients Affected by Rare Diseases","date":"February 12, 2013","content":"I was on the 21 floor of the Hilton Hotel in San Francisco, looking out over an expansive view of the city, musing on how my life had changed from one of a scared and uninformed mom of a very sick child, to one of a rare disease advocate giving voice to a national audience. Last month, I had the opportunity to attend LinkedIn’s Global Sales Kickoff to speak with 2,000 of their employees about how LinkedIn changed my life and the lives of 1 in 10 American patients who are affected by rare diseases. I knew LinkedIn was an important tool, but up until a couple of months ago—I wasn’t sure how to utilize it effectively. Like many LinkedIn members, I wasn’t looking for a job or looking for someone to work for me—I was looking to break through a barrier in communication that I so often come across in my line of work. I’m a television producer for , a morning talk show on Lifetime Television. As a producer, my job requires me to create story lines, sell them to my executive board and work with the heads of major corporations to develop a segment suitable to our audience.  It’s a time-intensive process as the deadlines of a daily show require quick decision making skills by all parties involved. Last year, my daughter Ilana had spent more time in the hospital than out. There were no answers to what was wrong with her, just multiple symptoms that had become increasingly debilitating. This wasn’t new for us, but the intervals between sickness and health had gone from short to nearly nonexistent. Since no doctor had any answers, I like most parents in the rare disease world, had taken on the responsibility of researching her medical issues and tracking down specialists. My exhaustive search led me to a community of patients and parents just like us. I realized that I had the tools and audience to help facilitate a voice for the rare world. Fast forward a few months and The Balancing Act had green lighted my idea for a series called . I had a very serious segment that was up for consideration. The topic was a disease called and I knew of a company that was working on FDA approvals and would be the perfect fit; however I could not connect with the Vice President of Marketing. Every time I called the company, it seemed like someone was putting up a wall between me and the person I really needed to talk to. Finally, in my frustration I searched for the drug on LinkedIn and lo and behold, to my amazement the VP of Marketing’s profile popped up. Bingo. I pulled out my credit card and signed up for LinkedIn’s executive membership and inMailed him directly. His response was immediate, he loved what I was doing, and he was in. This exact situation repeated itself over the course of the show’s production as I’ve found dozens of expert guests through LinkedIn.

Your significant other pulls out a small box, wrapped in gold paper and a bright red ribbon. You slowly unwrap the box, and inside you find the gift you’ve always wanted…your dream job! Okay, maybe that’s a little fantastical, but dating and job hunting aren’t as unrelated as you might think. In fact, many of the “rules” of successful dating can prove helpful in your career planning and job hunting: 1. “There are plenty of fish in the sea.” We’ve all become smitten with a person or job opportunity that seemed to be absolutely perfect for us. Well, as a job seeker in a challenging job market, it’s actually quite dangerous to set your sights on one absolutely perfect position. You’re likely to be disappointed, and you’ll be ignoring all of the good positions that might have great potential. Smart job seekers cast a wide (but focused) net. Here’s how: 2. “Opposites attract.” We all know couples with totally different personalities, and yet somehow those two very different parts make one terrific whole. When it comes to job hunting, opposites attract as well. What they attract are opportunities. If you’re feeling stuck in a career rut or your job search has stalled, perhaps the problem is that your professional connections are too similar to you. To refresh your job search and uncover new prospects, you need to diversify the people who are referring opportunities to you. I recommend joining a few LinkedIn groups that appeal to you but are outside your “normal” interest areas. For instance, if you are an engineer but lately you’re intrigued by all of the changes happening in the media industry, visit the and join a media-related group or two. Once inside the group, pay attention to the issues people are discussing, the companies that group members work for and any ways you can help fellow group members by sharing your different perspective. As you come across people you’d like to network with, perhaps fellow job seekers, send a brief message that reads something like this:    3. “Love is patient, love is kind.” This is a Biblical quotation that has crossed over into the secular world, spoken at many weddings and anniversary celebrations. It is a simple and powerful statement that absolutely applies to job hunting as well. Because the web makes it so easy to reach out to people without a lot of thought or planning, recruiters frequently tell me how much they appreciate job applicants who are prepared, polite and thoughtful in their communications.

I'm amazed not only by how fast we've grown, but the kind of connections that are forming through online conversations and face-to-face events. Our members are located all over the world and across a variety of industries, but the common thread is how invested they are in their careers and how much they want to help fellow group members be successful in theirs.

Not knowing what to do with myself, I moved in with my parents, applied to jobs, ate Spaghetti-Os and watched all seven seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Not exactly a resume filler for an aspiring marketer! Like every twenty-something with a problem, I turned to the internet. With a combination of blogging, social media and “inbound job hunting”, I was thrilled to land my dream job at , the all-in-one marketing software company on a mission to make marketing people love. This is my story. from on originally posted on When I started my job hunt, everyone around me seemed to be drowning in a sea of resumes, applicant tracking systems and unanswered emails. I knew there had to be a better way to connect with my future employer. Enter LinkedIn. The challenge was to differentiate myself from an enormous group of people just like me--according to The Atlantic, in 2012. At Tufts University, I minored in Entrepreneurial Leadership Studies and in Professor ’s marketing class, I learned about inbound marketing.  Instead of interrupting customers with advertising messages, inbound marketing encourages the use of social media and content to get found and build relationships with customers. I decided to apply those same principles and used “inbound job hunting” to connect with employers through relationships and content. LinkedIn was one of my biggest assets because it united all the aspects of my job-hunt in one place. Here’s how it helped me: Online platforms like LinkedIn gave me enormous power in a process that often felt out of my control. As a new job hunter, LinkedIn was more than a static, online resume--I used it to navigate and maximize every step of my job hunt. Now, I’m just excited to see how this same platform can empower my next chapter as a young professional.

LinkedIn's event took place at , a veritable power portal for the business elite, just off of Park Avenue in Manhattan. The evening consisted of cocktails, hors d'oeuvres, makeup makeovers, headshots taken by professional photographers, LinkedIn Profile makeovers and an amazing chat with world-famous makeup artist Bobbi Brown, the founder of and author of the new book . During the fireside chat I asked Bobbi: Below is an excerpt from the chat Bobbi and I had last night. The business started 21 years ago basically as a result of my being a freelance makeup artist and realizing that everything that I used as a makeup artist I had to mix together and most of the cosmetics on the market were not easy to put on. They didn’t make you look better. So I started basically with a quest to create a lipstick that looked like lips. Friends, family, women I meet, my artists...

There is no such thing as balance all the time. There are days when you come home from work and everything is perfect and you feel like that for a second and then something happens. Sometimes I am more work focused, sometimes more family focused. You have to work to maintain balance. It’s about showing that you have simple strength. You know, you have to be confident in what you do. Confidence is everything. And sometimes, if you’re not confident, you just have to act like you are.

Some workspace items are functional but still personal, like the J-shaped massage tool that Duke University Professor uses to stay loose, or the Post-It note that -- along with a daily alarm -- reminds entrepreneur to floss and stretch at 3 p.m. For many, work calls for something besides simply sitting and typing.

At BGCP, our mission is to provide hope and opportunity to at-risk youth in our community so Bryan’s message of “justice for all” left us inspired and more committed than ever to our work. Here were some of the highlights for our team. Perhaps it was a coincidence that Bryan’s visit was the Friday prior to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day and President Obama’s inauguration, but it felt like more. The combination of these three events reinforced how far we have come as a country and how much more there is to do until we achieve our shared vision of justice for all. Bryan Stevenson grew up humbly in Alabama, earned his law degree from , and is a professor at Law School. He founded and now runs the , an organization that provides legal representation to indigent defendants and prisoners who have been denied fair and just treatment in the legal system. Bryan began by talking about the power of identity. He shared a personal story about how his grandma shaped his identity when he was a child. She told him he could be anything he wanted to be and made him promise he would never drink alcohol. Bryan still has not had a single drop of alcohol, but not drinking isn’t what makes him a better person; what matters is keeping his promise to his grandma and that shapes who he is today. And that’s the power of identity. He then described some of the challenges he sees in America today. He painted a portrait of oppression through the years made worse by recent policies based on fear and anger. While Bryan painted a bleak picture at times, he used colored paint. He is an optimist, and in all of his stories he had a solution. He truly believes in the human spirit and the potential of every person to thrive. He specifically believes in the power of Silicon Valley and LinkedIn to imagine and create a better world, to invent solutions that we never knew were possible. For my colleagues at BGCP and me, Bryan’s commitment and passion for a better society were inspiring.  We share his vision for justice for everyone. Like him, we’ve dedicated our careers to helping others less fortunate. While he manifests his vision through the legal system, we manifest it by providing hope and opportunity to the at-risk youth in our community. Hearing him articulate our shared values was energizing for all of us. In his inauguration speech, President Obama said, “Today we continue a never-ending journey, to bridge the meaning of [the Declaration of Independence] with the realities of our time. For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they have never been self-executing.”  This is why Bryan and my colleagues, like Dr. King before us, go to work every day.

He shares lessons from Warren Buffett, Meg Whitman and more. When Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban looks at colleges, he sees the slow-to-change newspaper industry, struggling to adapt. Universities are doomed to fail, he says, and students will soon give up on attending one school for four years. Thinking that employees will remain at a company forever is 2001, writes MedCity Media founder and CEO Chris Seper. When his employees get an offer elsewhere, he says “congratulations” and takes it as a sign he’s doing something right. Today’s designer doughnut craze would make even Homer Simpson blush. Trend tracker Nancy Kruse explains how doughnut shops are combining economics (the theory of scarcity) with off-the-wall flavors (kefir lime and roasted chilies) to drive sales. Cirque du Soleil upended the circus industry decades ago by putting on an entirely different show than Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey. Whereas Ringling catered to kids, Cirque focused on adults. While Ringling's prices were similar to movie tickets, Cirque charged a premium. The company, in other words, had found \"blue waters,\" a place where it could swim without the established sharks. The question: How will you find those waters in your own career? Newly released emails between Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and former Palm CEO Edward Colligan are amazing for a couple of reasons, says The New Yorker's Nicholas Thompson. The documents, part of a lawsuit over whether the companies colluded to not hire from each other, \"show Jobs in his fullest: sharp, protective, dynamic, bullying, and prickly,\" Thompson writes. But they also raise questions about the motivations behind Apple's litigation. When Australian entrepreneur Naomi Simson appeared on the reality TV series \"Secret Millionaire,\" working as a volunteer in a homeless shelter and living on just $20 a day, she came away humbled by what she had learned.

Seated around a long table in a sunshine-filled conference room, the six board members introduced themselves, and over plates of eggs, black beans, and rice, shared how they had come to join the team. One by one, each thanked the proposed school's founder for inviting them to join the board, and one member thanked LinkedIn. Exchanging a knowing glance and chuckle with his colleagues around the table, the member reminded us that every individual on this board had been identified through an exhaustive search on LinkedIn. I work for an organization called (BES). Through our one-year Fellowship, BES entrepreneurs to design, found, lead, and sustain excellent charter schools in underserved communities nationwide. As the Director for Governance and Board Development, I am responsible for ensuring that each BES Fellow identify, vet, and invite 7-9 members to their proposed school’s founding board of directors. Founding board members of BES charter schools must believe in our mission, commit the time necessary to found an organization, be dedicated to the community, and contribute to the board's diversity. At BES, we believe that diverse boards function more effectively and are better stewards of the public trust. We seek diversity in the areas of professional expertise and seniority, gender, age, race/ethnicity, and sometimes, language. Anyone who recruits board members (or any talent for that matter) knows that, at the end of the day, identifying the right people is all about networking. My challenge at BES--and, frankly, what makes my work exciting--is that every year, I work collaboratively with the Fellows to build 8 to 12 boards simultaneously, in multiple cities, ideally within the first three months of the Fellowship year, and with limited time and contacts on the ground. More than a third of the individuals we have invited and confirmed for charter school boards this year were first identified through LinkedIn. LinkedIn has become an essential tool that allows us to: Alongside more traditional recruitment strategies, LinkedIn opens the door to outstanding board prospects who we can evaluate further through background research and in-person interviews. Consider one of the charter school boards we recently built in a southern city. As is typical, the Fellow leading the founding of this proposed school was new to the city, and due to the intensity of the training and travel associated with the BES Fellowship, had limited time on the ground. In his words, Five of the nine board members confirmed for the charter school being proposed by this Fellow were identified through LinkedIn.

It’s been well documented that Chicago is becoming more of a hub for tech companies— reported that 193 digital technology startups launched in Chicago in 2011. The good news is that we're in a growing industry. The bad news (for companies, anyway) is that there's not quite enough \"best and brightest\" to go around. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects software development-related roles and jobs to increase at double the national average through 2020. Several years ago we could post a job position and receive many qualified responses, but the boom in the tech industry means that we're now competing with other companies for a small number of people. The best devs can afford to be picky. And for us, it's not just about finding a dev who's technically qualified. We want to make sure that they're a good fit for our company culture, and that we're a good fit for them. \"Culture more than anything else—not the job, not salary, not projects, but an attractive culture—causes people to leave one job for another,\" our COO maintains. So what's a company that's hiring to do? In the last year, we've turned to LinkedIn as a way to spot devs we think could work well at Table XI. After finding candidates with the right experience and skills on LinkedIn, we go to their websites, their blogs, their Tumblr pages—anything we can find that gives us a sense of who they are and what they like. Learning more about our favorite candidates gives us some ideas about how to approach them on a more personal level. One candidate we discovered over the summer was a dev named . He was extraordinarily qualified; we loved his work; and, of course, he was employed elsewhere (recently, no less). We needed a way to get his attention and make ourselves interesting to him. Andrew's is designed like a Dr. Seuss book, complete with his own Seussian art and rhymes (can you tell why we liked this guy so much?). Mark also happens to be a Seuss fan, so to get Andrew's attention, he spent a long time crafting his own poem of an introductory note, explaining—in rhyme—why he thought Andrew should check us out in return. We wanted to show Andrew, not just tell him, that our personality and creativity mirrored his. Like any talented Ruby developer, Andrew had received a lot of recruitment notices, but ours stood out because it was obvious we had taken the time to learn about him specifically, rather than sending him a generic email. Take a look:                         This definitely made an impression on Andrew. He appreciated that we'd done our homework and put some effort into recruiting him, and thus began our courtship. In addition to coming into our office to view our projects and eat some chef-cooked lunches, Andrew attended some of our events like our Summer Movie Nights series. Over the course of several weeks he got a chance to know the passionate people who work here, and see that we're not just a dev shop looking at him as a \"resource,\" but a dev shop looking at him as a good professional and cultural fit.

It's perhaps not surprising that a lot of fuss (both good and bad) is often made about the duchess.

I love new beginnings, and January 1st is the newest and freshest start of them all. If you’re a job seeker, now is the perfect time to reinvigorate your efforts, try some new strategies or consider a fresh perspective. With those goals in mind, here are three career trends I’m predicting for 2013 and tips on how you can incorporate them, with the help of LinkedIn, into your New Year’s job search: We've seen this happening for some time -- people leading with their LinkedIn profile vs their resume. I believe 2013 is the year that many employers will rely more on LinkedIn than traditional resumes to make their hiring decisions. Employers may still request traditional resumes, but those will take a backseat to your LinkedIn presence. The reasons why are numerous: a LinkedIn profile provides so much more information and richer context for one’s career path, skills and experience; a resume limits you to one or two pages while a LinkedIn profile is unlimited; and your LinkedIn profile is public, so employers consider it to be more trustworthy (i.e., very few people lie on their LinkedIn profiles because their connections would quickly call out any untruths or exaggerations). In some ways, your LinkedIn profile needs to mirror your resume. Factual information, such as your job titles, dates of employment and educational credentials, need to match exactly. And your overall skill set, experience level and areas of professional focus need to remain consistent so you don’t appear to be two completely different job candidates. Beyond those basic similarities with your resume, your LinkedIn profile is completely customizable. To make your profile most appealing to employers, first , such as “Big Idea Salesperson with Track Record of Success in the Construction Sector.” Not sure what to say? Gather inspiration by researching the LinkedIn profile headlines of some successful people who have the type of job you want. Next, a to help recruiters match your name with your face when they meet you in person. Then, make sure that the rest of your profile acts as a more comprehensive version of your resume, including all of your , unique accomplishments, measurable results (e.g., “decreased average customer service call wait time by over 2 minutes”) and from former colleagues and managers. Once you feel your profile is the best it can be, tap a few trusted friends or family members to review it with a critical eye. Specifically, ask them two questions: If your friends can’t answer these questions, or their answers are not what you’re hoping for, then go back to the drawing board. One last point: remember that your LinkedIn profile is a living, breathing representation of you, so regularly revisit your profile to make sure it’s up-to-date with new accomplishments. You can also keep your profile fresh and appealing to recruiters by frequently about topics that matter to you. These shares appear right at the top of your profile in the “Activity” section, so they will keep your profile looking active and compelling. As the job market continues its sluggish improvement, employers will continue to limit hiring to essential functions. This means that throughout 2013 they will seek job candidates with the exact skill sets they need. In other words, generalists are out; specialists are in. As a job hunter, you need to be an expert at promoting your unique skills, talents and qualifications. Visit LinkedIn’s frequently to scour job postings in your field to identify what skills are most frequently mentioned in the job listings that appeal to you. You can also look at the “Insights” tab of potential employers’ LinkedIn Company pages to see the top five most popular skills mentioned by that organization’s employees. When you possess any of the skills you find mentioned, go right to your own LinkedIn profile and add that skill to the of your profile and find ways to mention it in your as well. Employers search by highly specific keywords (e.g., “romance and science fiction literary agent” as opposed to simply “literary agent”), so the best way to be found by an employer is to make sure those exact keywords appear prominently in your profile. The oldest members of Generation Y (a.k.a. the Millennials) are no longer teenagers, and they are joining the ranks of management in companies around the world. This means that the “kid” you knew as a college intern a few years ago could be your connection to a great position. So, as you think about building your LinkedIn network, remember to reach out to people of all generations. One great way to do this is to join and become active in your college or university’s LinkedIn alumni group. If your network is lacking in Gen Y contacts and you’d like to build more, you can use to search for more recent graduates of your alma mater by location, employer and/or job function. For instance, if you’d like to connect with recent grads in London who work in healthcare, you can search by graduation years of 2000 to 2012, then click on the “London, United Kingdom” bar under “Where they live” and the “Healthcare Services” bar under “What they do.” You’ll be able to view the profiles of people who fit that exact criteria, and then use an InMail (if you are a Job Seeker Premium Account holder) to reach out and introduce yourself. Your message might look something like this:    What other job search and recruiting trends are you anticipating for 2013?

In fact, based on a new LinkedIn survey, more than 74% of us globally added a professional goal to our lineup in 2012. Rather than wanting a new job, most professionals wanted to learn new skills in the new year. What I've seen over the last few years is that we've finally come to realize the classic resolution to \"lose five extra pounds\" may have something to do with the fact that we're wandering into the pantry because it's been years since we've acquired a and we're bored. That the \"get out of debt\" resolution we've had on the list since college may have something to do with the fact that we haven't negotiated a raise. Or that we haven't \"met a new boyfriend\" because we haven't extended ourselves and met anyone new professionally or otherwise in the last year. I'm sure you have long since realized that creating a list isn't the hard part, it's sticking to it that finds us with more weight, more debt and sitting alone at our desk come March. Three weeks in and while you're still going strong (or if you’re not, you can start again without anyone even knowing) here are some tips for staying motivated! I’m not particularly proud of this story but I’m willing to share because it worked for me, and may for you too. Having moved to NYC to build the next phase of my career, I was sipping a coffee while watching a national morning show when all of a sudden there she was…the woman I competed with most closely in my professional space, sitting across from the anchor in the seat I coveted. While truly I come from a place of abundance and wanted her to do a great job, I could tell by the feeling I had in my gut that I needed to turn my envy into my own reality. In the days that followed I created the “I want that” model of career accomplishment and it goes something like this: Once you identify someone whose shoes you’d like to find yourself in, . What skills does she have, what does she belong to, where has she worked, which positions did she accept to land her current position, who is she connected to?  There’s a ton you can learn about how to get where you want to go by walking in someone else’s shoes. There’s nothing like telling someone you're going to do something to get your butt in gear.  Use LinkedIn to and even better, some of the tips and tricks you're learning to accomplish them. You may also want to invite some of your connections to join you in a “Goal Group.” Facilitate the conversation around why you’ve chosen this goal and express some of your challenges and innovative ways you’re succeeding. The one thing I’ve learned in the support group model is that it’s a mistake to only invite those in your industry. Some of the best, most innovative and inspiring ideas may come from the fresh eyes of someone who doesn’t do what you do.  Having a goal is the foundation, not a specific industry or job. The goals that keep us on track long into the New Year are those that are tied to something beyond paying the rent (although don’t underestimate that one as well). By ‘Find the Why,’ I mean that the basis of willpower and perseverance is founded in a specifically articulated reason for committing to this goal in the first place and the more intimate, meaningful, life-affirming and even vulnerable it is, the more likely you are to see it through. The best example I have for you is fitness. Prior to my son being born it was all about fitting into my jeans and I missed more classes than I took. Now, it’s about being around to see him walk down the aisle or have his own kids. If you've lost track of your why in the day-to-day grind of your career, the key is to connect with others. and ask what inspired them to get into their career. This is a great question in that it’s not one they are likely to be asked or reflect on often enough and in the process of sharing, you’re creating a more meaningful connection than what would come with a standard connection request. Another equally motivational tactic attached to your why is sharing 'yours'. Find someone to mentor by looking for or using your own to identify someone who is in a similar position to where you started out."},{"post_categories":["Featured","LinkedIn for Small Business","Infographic"],"author":"Deep Nishar","title":"200 Million Members!","date":"January 9, 2013","content":"We recently crossed an important and exciting milestone for the company.

I’d like to thank each of you for helping build the LinkedIn network into what it is today. It’s been amazing to see how our members have been able to transform their professional lives through LinkedIn. You truly grasp the power of LinkedIn when you start to focus on these individual success stories. Take for example, from New Delhi, India who was able to use LinkedIn as a launch pad for his career. Not only was he able to lead an international project at AIESEC for a project on AIDS right out of university, with the help of LinkedIn, he was recruited by KPMG and continues to receive career guidance from his LinkedIn network. Then there's who stepped out of her comfort zone from teacher to now a published writer and leader of a ESL Bilingual Educators group on LinkedIn. She has rediscovered former talents and  changed her life through LinkedIn. One of my favorite stories comes from from Brazil who founded Cemec, an organization to help Brazilian professionals and entrepreneurs think creatively about their business challenges. Today they use LinkedIn as their digital classroom to exchange information and foster a meaningful community to share relevant knowledge. Everyday we hear stories like these from our members and we look forward to hearing many more. So, who are LinkedIn’s 200 million members? This infographic captures the diversity and magic of  your professional peers. This milestone is more than just a metric -- it’s a reminder of  the global footprint and the scale of impact our network has each day.

I had worked incredibly hard for many years to get to this point, but now I was feeling unhappy and uninspired by my career. To make things worse, I didn’t know what I was supposed to do besides finance, but I knew I didn’t want to live the rest of my life like this. It was in this hopeless and dark place where my transformation story began. I was 40 years old and the effects of stress started showing up in my body. Rather than just treating the symptoms of these ailments, I chose to understand myself and my life at a deeper level. This shift in my focus transformed me from being a Finance executive to a Wellness Coach and Qigong Energy Healer. Here are some takeaways from my journey of transformation that I hope will inspire those of you who are thinking about taking the next step: 1. The first thing I worked on was myself: I started taking care of my physical and mental state to build a strong foundation. I focused on Qigong meditation to calm my mind, on healthy eating to rejuvenate my body and on writing to express myself. 2. I realized that I was where I was in my life because of the choices I made in the past. I had to understand those choices before I could move forward. I had chosen accounting and finance because it provided me a sense of security. I knew if I worked hard and learned the rules and regulations, I would be rewarded. It was safe and straightforward.  When I realized that “safety” was no longer the value at the top of my list, things started to shift. I replaced it with values such as “Healthy Lifestyle”, “Personal Growth” and “Helping Others” and looked for opportunities that honored these values. 3. This is the toughest one. As I shifted my values, I also needed to follow them with actions. I allocated more time to personal growth workshops. I also started a blog where I shared my thoughts and life experiences. Both of these were new experiences that connected me with my values and helped me expand beyond my comfort zone. 4. As opportunities came up, I made it a point to open doors that aligned with my values. I realized that I didn’t need to calculate and analyze exactly what experiences I needed to reach a certain goal. I didn’t even have a goal of becoming a wellness coach. But when I started to heal myself from the symptoms of stress, I knew I couldn’t stop there. After putting together a successful coaching practice, I still follow each opportunity that presents itself with curiosity.  I don’t know where all of this is going to lead me, but as long as they are connected with my values, I know it’s going to be fulfilling and meaningful. 5. Transformation requires courage, but most importantly, it requires patience. Transformation doesn’t happen overnight. In the beginning of my journey, the only thing that was certain was the value of “helping others”, which was one of the values I carried in my heart since childhood. After 20 years in finance, I looked back and realized that I needed every experience in my career to make my coaching sessions as transformational as they are today. I just had to wait for my time. We are all born with special gifts and unique skills. Some of us are lucky that we are already using them in our life’s work. Others are standing on the sidelines waiting to find their place. For those who are still waiting, trust that you have a unique place in this world and believe that you’ll get there by taking one step at a time."},{"post_categories":["Influencers"],"author":"Chip Cutter","title":"This Week in Thought Leaders: Rewriting the ‘Peanut Butter Manifesto,' Breaking Down Zipcar's Deal, and More","date":"January 5, 2013","content":"LinkedIn members started the new year by diving into stories on how to improve their careers – and how to make sense of the Zipcar deal.

Here's who they were and what they wanted to know: Feel free to leave follow-up questions in the comments in my original post and we'll ask Richard to answer the questions in future posts. ------------------------ Edited transcript: You do need lucky breaks to be successful. I've had enormous amounts of luck. In my personal life, I've done foolish things like fly around the world in balloons or trying to break transatlantic boating records. I've been pulled out the sea 5 times by helicopters. In business, there have been many moments. When we launched Virgin Atlantic, people thought we were completely mad to go from having a record company to going into the airline business. My bank thought I was absolutely mad. When we arrived back from our inaugural flight, the bank manager was sitting on my doorstep saying they were going to foreclose on the entire Virgin little empire. In the end, it's down to individuals. I would encourage companies to work really hard towards getting a 50/50 split of women on their board — even to the extent of encouraging politicians to actually change laws to force a situation to where there's 50% women on boards. Because in countries where they've done it — like Norway and Sweden — the companies seem to have benefited from it. But in the meantime, all of us who own companies must try to increase the size of our boards to make sure we get more women on the boards. You have to define what success is. I've spent a lifetime creating things that hopefully I think can make a difference to other people's lives. I've genuinely never set about to think of myself as a businessman. If I lost it at all I'm sure I'd want to carry on creating. Most of my time is now spent creating not-for-profit ventures like The Elders or Carbon War Room or Center for Disease Control or trying to protect species. That's where I get my main satisfaction from. And somehow, even if I didn't have any money, I'd continue to do that. It's a fantastic offer. When we set up the The Elders, which is headed up by Nelson Mandela, Kofi Annan and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the idea was to go into conflict regions and try to resolve conflicts. And they've done some stellar work. And in time what we also want to do is set up Elders on a local basis. It's such a waste of people my age and other elders who have retired not to have the satisfaction of getting out there and making a difference in the world. And maybe he could actually get in touch with us and we could experiment with him by doing something locally in his area. And if it works there, maybe we could spread it out around the world."},{"post_categories":["Editorial"],"author":"Chip Cutter","title":"The 12 Most Popular Stories of 2012","date":"December 19, 2012","content":"This year's most popular stories on LinkedIn reflect a common theme: self-improvement.

He frequently talks about the importance of doing “small goods” for the people in your network, such as forwarding a useful article, flagging an interesting discussion in a group, or making an introduction to someone in your network. Hoffman believes, and I agree, that the more you give, the more you will receive in return. Plus, it always feels great to help other people. For job seekers, giving is also a beneficial job search tactic. Check out these ways that giving to others on LinkedIn can help you get hired: LinkedIn’s new feature is a great way to give a quick boost to a professional connection you’ve worked with or gone to school with. When you endorse someone for the areas of expertise you believe he or she possesses, you’re giving a quick gift while at the same time showing that person that you care -- and that you have noticed his or her strengths. As an added bonus, your profile photo will appear next to the skills you’ve endorsed, which will serve as a frequent reminder to the person you’ve endorsed that you are a trusted and generous member of his or her network. The next time that person hears of a relevant job opportunity, your endorsement may serve as a reminder of what a good candidate you’d be for that position. In addition to providing endorsements, you might consider for contacts whose work you know well. Like endorsements, recommendations show people that you are a generous member of their networks, but they provide another job search benefit as well: recommendations help you tell more of your career story. Here’s how: in a recommendation, you can talk about specific projects you’ve worked on with a colleague, results you jointly achieved for a client or characteristics you admire in a manager. Recommendations, which of course have the primary goal of helping the person you’re recommending, have the secondary benefit of showing a potential employer what you value and what a good team player you are. As a result, a recommendation appearing on the page of a colleague just might inspire a recruiter to click over to your profile to learn more. Another gift to give this month is one of the most valuable commodities in the Information Age: knowledge. Check every day to find opportunities to share helpful articles with your network, to answer a question a contact has posted or to chime in with your thoughts on an interesting discussion in an industry group. In addition to being helpful to people in your network, all of these actions provide you with visibility to potential employers or connections to job opportunities. Stepping away from the computer for a moment, December is a wonderful time to volunteer in person for organizations you support. Many organizations are especially busy at the end of the year and need professional support, such as budget planning, grant writing, bookkeeping, fundraising and more. Volunteering in any capacity is a valuable pursuit, but for job seekers who contribute their professional talents, this . For example, if you are not currently working, you can include an ongoing volunteer role as your current Position on your LinkedIn profile. If you are volunteering in a more casual or sporadic way, you can still impress potential employers by including that work in the “Volunteer Experiences and Causes” section of your profile. Recruiters tell me frequently how impressed they are by job candidates who give back to their communities. Finally, a gift that everyone loves to open is a thank you note. Now is the perfect time of year to send a personal message to all of your LinkedIn contacts who have supported you over the past year. The best thank you notes are specific -- thank you for helping me prepare for my banking interviews, thank you for introducing me to your company’s recruiter, thank you for providing moral support the week I left my job -- and show genuine gratitude.

Looking back, I remember thinking it was a terrific idea, but I couldn’t think of anything applicable in my life. Two weeks later, I was introduced to through a colleague in my office. Philip, a professional photojournalist, was in Chicago to photograph folks in the office to see if he could capture the same human spirit in cubicles as he had in his work in the field. As the resident amateur photographer in Chicago, I was brought into the conversation. Over coffee, Philip told me about his nonprofit and a program they run called the Haiti Workshop for Foreign Field Service in Photojournalism, which takes a select group of amateur photojournalists into the field. As he told me more, my mind and heart began racing. I immediately knew this meeting was serendipitous; I had something transformational on the horizon. I had to go to Haiti. Earlier this year, I spent 7 days on the ground in Haiti. I traveled to the Central Plateau. I traveled to the tip of the Southern Peninsula. I spent time in some of the worst slums in all of Port au Prince, in Cite Soleil. I slept in tents in front of peasant houses and sat down with people from everywhere, listening to their stories. I saw more of the country than most other visitors, and more than most Haitians themselves. I took over 3,000 photos, and learned a tremendous amount technically and artistically about photojournalism. Funnily enough, upon return, the least important takeaways from my photojournalism workshop were about photography. The above are a sampling of photographs captured during my week in Haiti. None can capture the essence of what I saw, but hopefully they help paint a picture of what a rich, beautiful, and truly transformational experience my trip was. Six months later, I’m still trying to sort my thoughts and reactions. I still have no idea how to answer: “how was your trip?”  Most would assume I’d come back shell-shocked by  both the destruction I saw from the earthquake and the circumstances of those living in abject poverty. And sure--there’s an element of that.  The news coverage doesn’t lie; most of these people are in need of help in a big way. But more striking than the horrors was the beauty all around me. The contrasts were remarkable: a starving puppy standing in the midst of a stunning lakeside landscape; a pig sleeping in a mountain of trash next to a little girl running around playing with her sister, both with gleaming smiles on their faces; a group of kids, covered in grime in the worst slum in the country, delighting in a chance to fool around in front of the camera. Six months later, I do know this: I’m not the same person I was before I went. I catch myself looking around my home city of Chicago through a different lens, wanting to capture every moment of unexpected beauty that I come across. I want to take more pictures. I want to hear more stories. I also know that I want to go back. ."},{"post_categories":["Editorial"],"author":"Katie Carroll","title":"Introducing: Pulse for Windows 8","date":"December 10, 2012","content":"You asked, we answered: Pulse is now available for Windows 8!

In October, select thought leaders were given the ability to post long-form pieces on LinkedIn; chosen for their experience and smart perspectives.

One thing I realized is just how much I’ve learned about our company in such a short time - not just about we do, but about we do it. I can only attribute this quick cultural ramp to the consistency of character that I see in my colleagues day in and day out. We live our culture. We walk the talk. Is it cliché? Yes. Have I had a bit of KoolAid? For sure (and it’s delicious). But is it all true? Oh yeah. Two of the most prominent live-the-culture moments of truth for me have centered around and , both of which happen to be core to LinkedIn’s culture. Almost every company out there has a must-play-nice-with-others imperative for its employees; there’s little you can do without it. But what happens when you specifically hire for this imperative, and retain for it too? I found out on one of my first days at LinkedIn, when I got invited to sit in on a meeting, something about an Idea Bank, where folks were putting the finishing touches on an internal platform for ideas. Only later did I learn that this bunch – people from all across the organization – were the ones who had come up with and executed on an entirely original innovation platform called , galvanizing executive-level support, and spurring the creativity of hundreds of colleagues who have since contributed to it. Furthermore, the purely professional definition of Collaboration is augmented at LinkedIn with a dash (or a cupful) of compassion: people look out for one another. When I needed resources for a fledgling Talent Brand initiative, a colleague not only offered give me access to some of her team, but coached me on how to make the transition more fluid. At first I wondered what I was expected to reciprocate with, but there was no expectation – just the spirit of collaboration. Transformation is another word that you hear a lot of at LinkedIn. We are, after all, changing the way the world works. But here, Transformation starts with the individual. We are all called upon to transform , and LinkedIn has put itself on the hook to help make that happen. , our SVP of Global Solutions, once told me that one of his main goals is to ensure that the career trajectory of every LinkedIn employee is positively affected by their time here. He drew a handy graph to illustrate his point, and I now carry my own rendition of it wherever I go. I have heard dozens of stories reflecting this commitment, but unsurprisingly, the one that hits closest to home is my own: my career jumped from Management Consulting to Talent Branding. Why? Because the very first question my LinkedIn recruiter asked me during our very first conversation was: “What are you about?” By enabling me to transform my career, LinkedIn has placed its bet on me, and empowered me to transform so much more to come. (Watch out, world.) It’s true that it’s part of my job to look for the authentic ways in which LinkedIn expresses its culture. But I’m sure I’m not the only one who feels this way. In fact, I know I’m not, given our placement on list, as voted on by our employees. Many of the Glassdoor.com reviews reflect the elements I’ve described above. If any of them resonate with you, feel free check out our , or connect with a current employee through your LinkedIn network.

This impressive total puts LinkedIn in the company of vastly larger organizations including P&G, Shell and GE to name a few, and ahead of the likes of Microsoft, Salesforce.com, EA and interestingly enough the “Freemasons Global Network” which raised over $65,000. Twelve LinkedIn employees each raised over $1,000 individually with particular shout-outs due to Chicago’s who clocked in at more than $2,600 and New York’s , our #1 Mo Sista, who raised more than $2,000. Of course Movember isn’t just about raising money for men’s health initiatives, it’s also about spreading awareness and having fun. From dodgeball and foosball tournaments to beer tastings, bake sales, parties, auctions, photo walls, and even a couple of public (count on Team Dublin to go all out), LinkedIn teams around the globe embraced Movember with the passion we approach our everyday jobs transforming the way organizations hire, market and sell.

We see incredible ideas and prototypes, but there’s a limit to what can be done in a single day. A group of our “hackday masters” (employees who’ve won 3+ hackdays) came up with the concept of [in]cubator as a way to take hackdays to the next level. They evangelized the program internally, pitched the idea to the executive staff, got approval, and have been piloting the program for several months. In a sense, [in]cubator was itself the first [in]cubator project, and has now opened the door for many more. When teams pitch their [in]cubator projects, I have the pleasure of joining a panel of judges that includes CEO , co-founder , and SVP of Products and User Experience .

We see [in]cubator projects as small investments that have the potential to become big wins for the company. So far, we’ve approved five projects. One of our projects, an internal tool called go/book, has already shipped and completely changed how we book meetings at LinkedIn. It offers an intuitive user interface which overlays the availability of each meeting attendee with the availability of each conference room. It works across all 26 international LinkedIn offices and has captured the hearts of those who normally shy away from Exchange. The project was so successful, in fact, that we approved the go/book team for a second round of development. Whenever the executive staff approves a project, we also sign up as advisors for the team. We meet with the approved teams weekly to give guidance and do everything we can to make them successful. The next round of [in]cubator kicks off in February.

It was the of his week-long challenge to live on the and his supplies were thinning. After eating an apple for breakfast, and canned chickpeas for lunch, Booker needed to make some choices. “I’m realizing more and more that my current daily food intake cannot continue at the same pace,” he on Friday. “And so my new focus is on smaller portions spread throughout the day.” Booker began his experiment after a Twitter user questioned the role of government in providing food for low-income residents. He challenged that user to join him in living on food stamps for a week. He could spend just $4.32 per day, similar to the amount provided to participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in New Jersey. With that limited budget, Booker could not afford coffee, many breakfast items or indulgences like his beloved Ben & Jerry’s. That led to some surprises and regrets, as he his experience on LinkedIn. He , for instance, wondering why he hadn’t spent money to buy eggs. He yearned for coffee, that the lack of caffeine had led to painful headaches. But his came when he was forced to have a meeting in a bakery. “This was difficult and perhaps the greatest test of my resolve yet,” he explained. “Right after the meeting I hustled back to my car and downed more beans, cauliflower and broccoli and tried to imagine that it was Christmas cookies and cake.” His posts quickly became some of the most popular of the week. Many LinkedIn users applauded his efforts, and said they planned to take the challenge with him. Booker with the conversations about food injustice happening across America. There was another reason to be optimistic. Even with his food-stamp challenge, Booker still found energy to rush to the scene of a traffic accident in Newark this week to help the injured, . The takeaway? “His hunger and caffeine withdrawal haven’t dulled his superhero reflexes.” McKeown recently reviewed a resume from a talented individual. She had great experience. And, yet, there was a big problem – one that affects lots of professionals. The discussion over how to save big hometown newspapers is misguided, Seper writes. Yes, newspapers can be salvaged – but only if they stop acting like newspapers. He explains how selling the printing presses, paying big money for digital executives and establishing a “Skunkworks Division” can transform newspapers into media companies. Banks like to brag when they cleanup a park or build a home. Those community service projects are admirable, but there’s another way that these companies can make a difference: by not raising fees on the poor, and by providing more financial education. “Let’s face it,” Krawcheck writes, “the big banks are not one sharp advertising campaign away from restoring their reputations.” A small group of frequent travelers are ruining the air travel experience for everyone. These road warriors believe only “real” travelers fly to their destinations. They pout when their upgrades don’t clear. And they use demeaning terms – “amateurs” or “leisure travelers” – to refer to people who don’t fly as often. This is annoying, sure. But it also leads to a bigger problem at airlines. There’s a lot employees don’t know about their bosses. Managers, believe it or not, do want to be liked. They want to give you more money.

Do members still describe themselves as “creative” and “effective” professionals with “extensive experience” or did the most overused words in LinkedIn Profiles change from last year’s analysis? When we ran the analysis in 2011, we had 135 million members around the globe. Now we have more than 187 million. Even though we added more than 50 million new members since we did the last ranking, the data tells us that the number one buzzword globally is “creative” once again. Taking a look at more than 187 million profiles members have worldwide [1], these are the top buzzwords for a selection of countries: Switzerland Australia, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore,     Sweden, U.S. India Brazil Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, United Arab Emirates, United     Kingdom Egypt, Indonesia France, Italy Spain Here are the top 10 buzzwords used in the United States in 2012: As was the case last year, “creative”, “organizational”, “effective” are in the top three. This year though, more members this year described themselves as “responsible” and “analytical”, which made an appearance on our ranking for the first time. As a result, “dynamic” and “communication skills” got knocked off the list. “Motivated” is now ranked higher than “extensive experience” which was the top buzzword in 2010. Your LinkedIn Profile is an opportunity to define your professional identity. Set yourself apart in the new year by wiping your profile clean of buzzwords! We followed the same methodology as last year, we included non-English profiles in the analysis after translating them.

But what exactly does it say? In a word that actually means something: nothing. At a time when there is more content out there than you could ever possibly hope to read, quality—and not quantity—has become the absolute standard for standing out and getting noticed. Back when I started working with LinkedIn, we released . I remember thinking how important it was to steer clear of “extensive experience” (the number one overused term in 2010) if you wanted to shine among the 85 million professionals who were touting their years in the trenches as their defining characteristic. Well, it’s three years later and with over 100 million MORE professionals on LinkedIn, the stakes to stand out are even higher.  Here are a few tips for saying what you mean with words that will get you noticed. You wouldn’t mention how disorganized or irresponsible you are, and their antonyms (organized, trustworthy, etc) are wasted words too. Why you ask? Because these are the traits that an employer, client or co-worker expects you to have. Even if you scramble to find your shoes hiding under your bed each morning or frequently find yourself uttering the words “I’m going to be a few minutes late,” the expectation by all 85 of the Fortune 100 companies looking for talent on LinkedIn is that you can and more importantly will pull it together for the office. Rather than telling everyone who is willing to listen just how creative and effective you are, demonstrate it by using hard data. Integrate numbers to quantify your effectiveness to illustrate your creative talents. This is especially important on LinkedIn where you are 12 times more likely to have your profile viewed if you include more than one position. Yes, you were creative and effective in every job and volunteer position you’ve been in, but if you want to get the credit you deserve you need to get specific when giving a rundown of your work experience. Looking for synonyms to replace the “analytical,” “motivated,” and “innovative” words that litter your profile? Check out the largest professional thesaurus on the planet. Get yourself in touch with the movers and shakers in your industry via and and see what new words are on the rise. You also should that you’re interested in working with (or competing against). What terms are they using to describe the types of candidates they’re looking for? What do their top executives have listed in their profiles? If you’re nervous about coming up with fresh ways to describe the work you do, don’t sweat it. There are plenty of stellar profiles on LinkedIn that you can look to for inspiration. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel to get creative, but you do need to be running out in front of it.

The end-of-year right of passage at many companies makes both bosses and their subordinates squirm. So is there a better way to give feedback? A productive conversation may depend on the use of a single word, says Idealab founder Bill Gross. In one of this week’s , he implored managers to use “and” instead of “but” when talking with employees. The distinction may sound minor, but it’s significant, Gross says. “When you start telling someone, ‘You are really great at X, but when you do Y...’ the BUT negates all the goodwill that you are building up with the first part of your sentence,” Gross . “The BUT gets someone's defenses up, and makes them way less able to hear the important thing you want them to listen to.” Sure, it’s a simple technique.

So the next time you see a clunker on the road, don’t look on in disbelief; \"see it as the glorious thing that it is.” For young women starting a career, Simson has advice. Speak up. Use 25 percent fewer words in conversations (it’ll sharpen your message). And never think of money as a dirty word. Is the TSA doomed? Critics pummeled the security agency during a Congressional subcommittee hearing this week, noting that it had become expensive, inconsistent and unreliable. Rep. John Mica (R.-Fla.) even suggested closing the TSA as it exists today. Elliott says that can’t come soon enough. Far too many companies treat mobile devices like billboards. They slap an ad in the space, and hope consumers will notice it. When it doesn’t work, they’re baffled. Wong describes a different approach. College is an investment.

Recently, I organized a once in a lifetime trip to the remote fishing village of El Cuco, El Salvador for LinkedIn and Salesforce.com employees to construct their first ever high school. Prior to this school being built, kids had to take a 20 minute bus ride to the nearest town in order to attend classes after the 8 grade. Minimum wage is $2 an hour in El Salvador so most families can’t afford to send their kids on a $7 bus ride. For most kids in El Cuco, the last day of 8 grade also represented the last day of school which really limited their opportunities. Our group  covered all the costs of this trip including tools and building materials through individual fundraising efforts and generous company matches. We spent 8 days in the hot and humid jungle completing the roof, installing tile and painting. We also installed windows, doors and electric systems to add the finishing touches. My colleague said “It was a great experience that combined two interests of mine – traveling and volunteering. With our efforts, more kids will be able to attend high school, stay off the streets, and raise their own standard of living. That’s incredible.” One of the best parts of the experience was the opportunity to get to know locals on a level that tourists don’t get during traditional vacation. I met a fisherman the same age as myself named Chepe who shared his experiences growing up in El Cuco during the Civil War. El Cuco was the geopolitical boundary where the two conflicting parties met and was torn apart by war. Chepe has two kids that will be attending the school we helped build. Thanks to Surf For Life “voluntours” and the ongoing support of local government agencies, these kids will have access to a quality secondary education beginning in 2013. We're planning future projects for the Spring of 2013 in El Salvador, Costa Rica and Nicaragua.

I spent my first night in a park because I could not find an empty room. Easter weekend is not the best time to be a tourist in Rome. The museums, stores, shops were all closed. I went to the Vatican hoping to see the Sistine Chapel but it too was closed. So I stood with the thousands gathered in Vatican Square and was there when the Pope came out and blessed the crowd. That was cool, but I left a few days later feeling as if I hadn’t really seen Rome. So when I received an InMail on LinkedIn with the Subject: “Possible Trip to Rome” from , a person I had never met I was intrigued. She asked if I’d be interested in an all expense paid trip to cover the for the sciences and humanities. Interested?  You bet I was interested. I write about science and medicine as my profession The Balzan Foundation Prize is a very prestigious award with a cash prize of  $750,000 Swiss Francs (approximately $790,000 USD.) that have been given to people such as Pope John XXIII, the writer Jorge Luis Borges, and who won the Nobel prize in Medicine this year. So last week, I went to Rome. And it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. I realize most Americans are not familiar with these prizes. I certainly wasn't. I learned that The International Balzan Foundation was founded in 1957 by the daughter of , who was a journalist  born in 1874 in Italy. He fled Italy for Switzerland to escape prosecution by the Mussolini regime who did not like his politics. He became quite wealthy and when he died his daughter Lina started the Foundation in his honor. The prizes were given at a ceremony at the stunning , the home of President of the Republic of Italy.  I was the only American journalist/science writer there. All of my colleagues were from Europe.  As I watched the ceremony, I thought of my grandparents who were emigrants to the United States from Russian and Poland. I am alive because they decided, like Balzan, to leave their homes and take their chances in a new country where they would not be prosecuted for their beliefs. And I thought how proud they would be that their grandson was invited to the Presidential Palace to watch the President of Italy, who helped to establish Democracy in Italy hand out prizes to great men of science and the humanities. Having just witnessed the devastation of Hurricane Sandy weeks ago, I was especially pleased that one of the winners was (Australia), a climate scientist and immediate past president of the Australian Academy of Science. The next day, the prize winners spoke about their work at the , the oldest Academy in the world. Galileo was a member. This is where he laid the foundations of  modern astronomy with his observations of the moon, sunspots, the phases of Venus and the moons around Jupiter. I imagined him presenting his findings to his colleagues and thought of my father who was one of the founders of NASA.and assembled a team of physicists that figured out how to get man to the moon. I called to tell him I was walking up the very steps that Galileo did to the Assembly room. “I wish I was there with you,” he responded. As a journalist who writes about science and medicine, this was truly a dream come true. My possible trip to Rome became a reality. And as I walked up the steps that Galileo once walked on all I could think about was how lucky I was...all thanks to an InMail from LinkedIn."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Tips","Jobs"],"author":"Lindsey Pollak","title":"‘Tis the Season to Find a Job on LinkedIn","date":"November 28, 2012","content":"One of the old fashioned myths about job hunting is that you’ll never get hired in December. “People slow down for the holidays,” the thinking went. “Everything is on hold until the new year.” Thankfully I ignored that advice back in 1999, when I interviewed for and was offered my dream job at a career-focused Internet start-up just a few short weeks before Christmas. The same can happen for you. Here are five tips for job hunting during the holiday season, with help from LinkedIn: The holidays are the perfect time to reach out and get back in touch with people you haven’t spoken to in a while, such as former colleagues, former classmates, long-lost friends and members of professional associations you used to belong to. The key with this type of outreach is to make every communication personal. Rather than sending a blast “Happy Holidays” message or a generic e-card, write a customized note to each person (using a LinkedIn connection request if you still have the person’s email address or InMail if you are a account holder) to show that your desire to connect is genuine. And, save the news of your job hunt for a phone or in-person conversation. Your message should look something like this:    In addition to reconnecting with older contacts, you’ll likely spend time over the holidays with people you see on a regular basis -- friends, family and current business connections. To add a touch of professional networking to the holiday fun, check out people’s profiles on LinkedIn before heading out to a holiday party or family gathering. See what people are working on, which contacts you might have in common and where you might be able to offer them career support. At holiday events, it’s okay to talk about your job search and be specific about what kind of position you’re looking for. Most people, especially friends and family members, are happy to help or keep an eye out for opportunities. If you do have some great career conversations over eggnog and cookies, remember to send each person a connection request (if you’re not connected already) or a LinkedIn message early in the New Year to follow up on any leads and continue the conversation. Remember that myth that no one gets hired in December? Use it to your advantage! If many job seekers still pull back during December, you have a better chance of standing out to employers if you do submit an application. Any recruiter with active job openings is highly likely to check his or her inbox over the holidays, so make sure your application is there. Go ahead and follow up your application with an additional InMail message to the recruiter as well (you can often find the job poster’s name and a link to his or her LinkedIn profile right on the job posting page). You might say something like, “I wanted to follow up my application to position #12345 with a brief note to express my interest,” and then mention something specific you’ve read about the employer, such as a positive news story, an exciting industry development, a cause they support -- all of which you might learn about on the company’s website or on its . The process may not move forward until the New Year, but you’ll show the employer that you’re ready to hit the ground running. Next, keep in mind that people are reflective at the end of the year. They are often looking for “best of” lists, wrap-up reports and predictions for the coming 12 months. These are all great ideas for content to share in your LinkedIn status updates. If you serve as a resource for year-end news about your industry or a topic you’re passionate about, people will remember your expertise in the coming year when they hear about opportunities. December is also a great time to make sure that your LinkedIn profile and your resume include all of your accomplishments and updates from the previous 12 months. Did you take on a large that demonstrates your organization skills? Did you start a professional blog you can link to your profile? Did you complete some freelance projects that you can share in the Projects section of your profile? Besides increasing the overall value of your LinkedIn profile, another benefit of including new information is that your profile updates will be broadcast to members of your LinkedIn network (as long as you have your activity broadcasts turned on in your profile settings). You never know what might catch the eye of someone in your network who knows of a job opening. Happy Holidays and I look forward to seeing you on LinkedIn in 2013!"},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn for Small Business"],"author":"Jacky Carter","title":"What Would You Tell The Younger You?

Since I was a child, my family members have gathered on this day every year to celebrate with Indian sweets and fireworks.

At our Mountain View headquarters, we danced to a few Bollywood numbers and my musically talented colleagues sang melodious Bollywood songs. We also had incredible performances by professional Bollywood dance groups ‘ and .

Anyone in the LinkedIn sales organization could apply for a $3,000 grant for to do something that would transform you, your family or your community. I immediately applied.

I applied for the grant with the hopes that I could grow the event from the average 80 participants and $3,000 to something more. I was lucky enough to be awarded the grant and was then asked to tell my story at our Global Sales Kickoff. So, the next thing I knew, there I was - on stage at the Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas, telling my story about Fred and the 5k fun run to 1,000 of my colleagues from around the world. What happened next was beyond my wildest dreams. As soon as I finished my story and got off of the stage, the emails start coming in. “That was so inspiring”, “That was so moving.”, and “How can I help?” Colleagues came up to hug me with tears in their eyes (“Rachelle, you are making all the men cry!”) asking how they could be involved. I didn’t realize it at that moment, but my 5k run that I intended to plan in San Francisco just went global. One thing led to another and with the help of dozens of LinkedIn colleagues around the world, on November 11, 2012 – instead of having 80 participants raising $3,000 from one event in San Francisco, 460 participants from 16 different cities around the world raised ~$20,000.

After a little over a year and a half here, I’ve truly experienced this for myself. I started my LinkedIn journey as an Engineering Recruiting Coordinator where I was responsible for creating a flawless and unique interview process for candidates. A few months into the job, after it became apparent that I could take on more, my manager started asking me about my passions and aspirations and what I was interested in working on, intent on pairing my interests and skills with the needs of the business. At one point, I expressed my interest in international opportunities, particularly in learning more about LinkedIn’s offices around the globe. This interest very quickly turned into a reality. Right before my one-year anniversary at LinkedIn, I was asked if I’d be interested in a four-month assignment in Asia-Pacific. I would be going to our offices in Sydney, Singapore, Bangalore and Mumbai to help improve their existing efforts with coordination efficiency, reporting and candidate experience. Before I knew it, I was on a plane to Sydney embarking on an opportunity of a lifetime. Although this was an incredible opportunity, I was scared at first. Would I be able to accomplish everything I had set out to do? I have to admit that I had some doubts pulling it off, but my LinkedIn team believed in me, and I rose to the occasion. It’s still hard to believe that I spent four months in Asia Pacific, living out of suitcases, staying in hotels and visiting historical landmarks on weekends. It was challenging, I had my doubts, but I figured it out as I went (thanks to the support and patience of the teams I was visiting) and learned a lot along the way. I became a pro at using the reporting capabilities of our ATS, my Excel vocabulary is much larger than it used to be, and personally I’ve become more patient and more aware of cultural differences - something that cannot be learned from a textbook, but rather must be experienced. I’ve also come away with not only an appreciation for the resources we have at my home office, but a deeper and broader perspective, awareness and understanding for the challenges our satellite offices face. I’m now back in LinkedIn’s headquarters in Mountain View. Having proven to myself through my experiences abroad that I really can do anything, I’m on to my next challenge. As soon as I got back, I started in a new role as Talent Brand Coordinator, working on projects that showcase LinkedIn’s employees, their passions and how special this place is for all of us. I am so grateful for the personal and professional transformation that LinkedIn has already provided me.

I’m especially inspired by the efforts of my colleagues as they’ve taken the initiative to help those who were hit hardest by the storm. It is times like these that make me so proud to work for LinkedIn. A few days after the storm, I sent an email to our New York office to encourage my colleagues to take some company time and volunteer to help those in need.

Being legally blind he knew that flying a plane wasn’t in the cards for him, but after exploring what about being a pilot was so exciting and interesting to him, we were able to find other options that spoke to both his passions and talents. He ultimately landed a job as a project manager for a prominent business where his skills at encouraging different departments to work cooperatively and his great instincts for priority led to a successful career. It never hurts to dream big and sometimes they really do come true: nearly one in three LinkedIn members say that they either currently have their childhood dream job or work in a related field. But if your childhood fantasy was to become a professional swimmer or an Olympic athlete (the top choice for U.S. men surveyed) chances are you may need to have backup plan. However, if you think about what it is that you love about competition—either in the pool or on dry land— you might find exactly what you’re looking for in the career you already have.

Author and consumer advocate has a plan. In one of this week's most widely shared posts, he outlined why he will “opt-out” of the Transportation Security Administration's body scanners during the Thanksgiving travel week. He encouraged LinkedIn readers to do the same. His reasons are varied. The scanners may expose travelers to radiation. They likely violate Americans' constitutional rights. And they're also a waste of money, he says, costing a quarter of million dollars apiece. So, next week, Elliott is joining other travelers nationwide in refusing to walk through the machines. The protest, he says, is meant to “slow screenings to the point where the agency will have to reconsider the way it checks air travelers, as it did during a successful opt-out action two years ago.” His post brought a flurry of responses from professionals, including more than 600 comments. Many LinkedIn users agreed with Elliott and explained their own rationale for opting out, from fears of health risks to anger over what some say has become \"security theater\" at airports. Other commenters begged travelers to go through the machines -- if only to avoid holding up lines for everyone else. What’s your take? Read Elliott’s , vote on his poll – ? – and then take a look at seven other thought-leader posts worth reading: Every May, graduates from colleges around the country do the same thing.

The days of minimizing your Facebook profile when your boss walks by your desk may be coming to an end. Holmes, the CEO of HootSuite, says there’s a hidden benefit of employees tweeting, updating their Facebook profiles and managing their personal social networks on the job. It builds goodwill, for one, but it also does something powerful in breaking down corporate hierarchies between employees. The Obama campaign assembled a dream team of engineers to build the best tech infrastructure a campaign has ever had. It worked. Madrigal's question: Can the Dems sustain that technical prowess in the future? He's got a hunch they can. Here's why. If there's such a thing as a start-up in the federal government, it's the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The consumer agency is a little more than a year old, but it still needs to define itself. Mangan has advice. First, come up with a definition for predatory practices. Then, make sure crowdsourcing becomes a way of life. Kale is having a moment.

And while he may have a roadmap for what's ahead, Huffington says it's up to Americans to the president to adopt policy changes.

I had a house I was never in, a husband I never saw and friends and family I was completely out of touch with. I still remember finding the note from my assistant on my desk saying, “Call your mom, it’s important.” It was dated a week old. Yep. I was a wreck – on the inside. But, on the outside, I was a professional woman in her 30s with a high-powered career, a six-figure income, and running a $30M division of a company. I had perks galore. I was supposed to be happy because I was “successful.” Then it happened… I got pregnant with my first child. I had every intention of going back to work. I was lucky in that I had amassed some sick and vacation time. So, coupled with maternity leave, I had four months off. In that time, as I snuggled that gorgeous little creature in my arms, I had a huge Ah-ha Moment: I was her teacher in life. She was going to watch me and learn what to do (and what not to do), as a woman. The tears started to come. Yes, we can all agree hormones had something to do with that. But still, I was upset. Why? I realized in spite of the career progression I had worked so hard to achieve, it had come at a cost – I didn’t like myself. What kind of teacher could I be when I didn’t even respect what I was? Yet, I still wasn’t ready to start over. The security and comfort of the job (and the paycheck) kept nagging at my logical side. It’s funny. I have a journal I kept in those early months. I reread it from time to time to remind myself of how conflicted I was. Ironically, the decision to walk away didn’t come until… I was scheduled to return to my job the week after Thanksgiving. While on maternity leave, my employer had been bought. The new employer contacted me at home and asked me to come in the day before Thanksgiving to have a discussion. I remember saying to my husband, “Yippee! They are going to make this decision easy. They are going to lay me off!” Well, that didn’t happen. Instead, they let me know they were laying other managers off and I would be in charge of integrating our division with their own. My heart sank. I knew what this would entail. 60 hour weeks full of stress and more self-loathing. I went home and said, “I can’t do it. I can’t be like this in front of our child.” Thank goodness I have a husband who has known his whole life what he wanted to do. He has a level of career satisfaction few ever achieve. (In case you are wondering, he’s a pilot) He understood it was time for me to find my career love story too. He said, “Quit. It’s time to find out what you were meant to do.” FYI – Yes, I know how great he is. The journey to creating my own career love story after that day was filled with twists and turns, ups and downs, and a lot of curve balls. But, it landed me here. In all of it, there’s one thing I can tell you I learned to be true: You won’t get your happy ending until you step out of your comfort zone. Trust me, it’s where life begins. In the last ten years, I have met and worked with more people than I ever dreamed possible. My mission to change the way Americans approach their careers has been fortified by the incredible relationships I’ve been lucky enough to develop. None of this would have happened if I hadn’t been so afraid of what would result if I didn’t make a change. My career came alive when I let go of the world’s definition of professional success and started pursuing my own. It’s a strange feeling to let go of the addiction of trying impressing others so you can focus on impressing the only person that truly matters – yourself. Don’t get me wrong. It wasn't a merry, nothing-but-fun process. The doubters made it tough. A lot of people thought I'd gone CRAZY! There were plenty of days I was convinced of it too.  “Let me get this straight J.T., you are leaving your six-figure job to become a career coach?” I even lost friends. Or, should I say, so-called friends. What I gained was my self-respect and a passion for a career that has brought me more joy than you can imagine. (Seriously, I wish I could bottle it for you.) And with any luck, I'll be doing it for another 30 years. For me, it was worth it. But it wasn’t easy, and I’ll never tell you it was. There it is - my career love story.

A candidate that presents well one-on-one could turn out to be a disaster on the job. So should companies get rid of interviews, and invite applicants in for job tryouts instead? More employers are taking that approach, and Walk says it often makes sense for everyone involved. Small business owners pride themselves on their resourcefulness.

Not so in the U.K. Brown, the CEO of IDEO, explains how the government there replaced 750 separate websites with a one-stop shop that’s both useful and visually stunning. Top companies are obsessed with employee engagement. So how many actually engage employees in conversation? Gottschalk ponders the question and describes why a simple, powerful phrase – “What do you think?” – can change a company. There's much to love about the U.S. In the interest of improvement, though, Varsavsky points out some of the nation's biggest flaws. The country ranks 38th in life expectancy, for example, the legal system is expensive, and the murder rate is higher than many other developed nations.

Following the stock market crash of 1987, he said, people longed for comfort foods: roast chicken and mashed potatoes.

It's too early to tell, but it could very well be ice cream, a treat that had to be eaten quickly after residents lost power and needed to clear their freezers.

It was standing room only, but I was fortunate enough to see it live. The entire hour was full of insights and advice. Here are five highlights that really got me thinking. This is not a new argument by Andreessen, but he shared even more compelling examples to make his point. For example, he believes that the real magic of Apple is not its beautifully-designed hardware - but how its software ties you to additional Apple services and devices. You can never hire all the smart people in the world, but if you build a platform and let smart people build on it, you can leverage their talents. Having access to capital and a supportive legal structure is the bare minimum. You also need educational institutions like Stanford University  - both for the research as well as for the entrepreneurs that the university produces. Apparently, if you add up all the companies founded by Stanford graduates, it would be the world’s 10th largest economy. That is simply amazing and worth trying to replicate. In your career, there is no substitute for being at the center. Be “heat seeking” and go to the core of the matter because that is where you can take advantage of the the network effect. This is advice Andreessen got from cartoonist Scott Adams. Adams claims that the key to his success is being a professional hybrid: he is the cartoonist who understands business.

Yes, it's about two hours of my life in the shuttle, but hey, I get to live in . Luckily, we have a LinkedIn shuttle that picks me up and drops me back two blocks away from home. Now, most people consider commute time as time wasted. I’ve actually found it to be quite productive and enjoyable. Here are my tips and tricks: I’ve started spending some time in my commute discovering new artists, genres and music. I use to pick out music for me based on my mood. There are some hilarious podcasts, such as Stuff You Should Know, which make for a great listen. Also, you can listen to news on the radio or use to hear popular radio shows and news channels on your phone. A lot of people complain that they don't have enough time to read because of their long work hours. Guess what? A shuttle ride is the perfect time to unwind and read some amazing books. Currently, I'm reading Negotiation Genius and notes from Peter Thiel's Entrepreneurship course at Stanford. For work, I print out presentations to pore over during the commute. Being a news junkie, I spend most of my morning going over and to keep track of various technology trends. Being a Product Manager, you often lose track of the number of projects you're handling and the tasks associated with it. I have found that writing them down on or a task management system like is a great way to organize your thoughts. Apart from notes, I also type out product specifications for a new project and write emails that I may have forgotten to reply to during the day. Writing a blog (like this) is a great way to keep track of the life lessons learned and to share your experiences with the wider population. It's essential that we should expand our skills beyond the things that we learn in the office. My recent addiction is , which I use to read interesting questions and learn about philosophy, humor and epic stories. To brush up my front-end skills, I recently started using to learn Javascript. Confused about 401(k), investing and tax laws? Watch this Khan Academy's section of to learn more. Also, having subscribed to Netflix, sometimes I kick back, relax and watch a movie or documentary during the journey home. Being new to the Valley, the shuttle is a great way to meet people and make new friends. Most of the people that I hang out with over the weekend in the city are people that I met and talked with during the commute. Sometimes, I find people who I've been working on projects with and hold an ad-hoc meeting to discuss the progress of the project during the commute. As most of my family and college friends are out of town, I often call and FaceTime them during the shuttle to know what they are up to, as well. The main reason I love the shuttle/commute is that before coming to office every day I have an hour to prepare myself for the day and after leaving office I have an hour to wind down the day. Don't treat shuttle time as time wasted, but treat it as time that you can use to complete tasks by yourself. These two hours have helped me get great productive work done as well as maintain my work-life balance.

It feels great to play this role because both sides benefit immensely and somehow I (undeservingly) get the credit. Nonprofit board members have a unique opportunity to leverage their networks “for good” and LinkedIn makes it easy for them to do so. Here is why. The nonprofit sector tends to be very networked but primarily with each other and not with the business world. One of the most valuable roles a nonprofit board member can play is being the bridge to a whole new set of resources in the form of knowledge (skilled volunteers), donations (potential donors or corporate partners) and connections (future board members). One great way to truly grok this (finally used this word in a blog post) is to visualize it with our tool. InMaps is an interactive visual representation of your professional universe that enables you to see the way all your connections are clustered and related to each other. And, it can really highlight the opportunity that a nonprofit board member has to be the bridge to new and valuable connections. Here are two inMaps. This is an example of someone who has an enormous number of connections but the connections are mostly redundant. In other words, almost everyone is connected to each other. You remove one from the cluster and it wouldn’t significantly impact the network. This is my inMap. The blue cluster represents my LinkedIn connections, the orange my Yahoo! connections (where I worked for 9 years) and the green and pink are a combination of my many nonprofit affiliations. My LinkedIn network makes it easy and efficient for me to connect these two worlds. Last month, LinkedIn announced , a new program that enables nonprofit leaders to find the right quality professionals to join their boards. Critical to the success of this program is making sure that nonprofit leaders are connected to their board members on LinkedIn. In this way, they can leverage their board’s valuable connections. If you are a nonprofit leader, sign up for our next If you are on the board of a nonprofit, make sure you are connected to the Executive Director.  And even if you’re not on a board but are passionate about nonprofits, reach out to nonprofit leaders and connect.

Crux is a design and engineering consultancy, working with some of the world’s largest companies helping to develop their future products. What’s been really interesting to witness is the evolution of the way in which companies interact, specifically on LinkedIn; generally there is openness to hearing from other like-minded organisations, and making connections with key decision makers online has replaced the swapping of business cards. One such example and one that we are very proud of indeed - was the contact made with who we worked in partnership with for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympics this Summer… It started with an initial contact on LinkedIn with the Head of Research & Innovation, we spent a little time introducing our work with airflow within medical devices as well as new innovative materials. This led to a mail exchange in which they mentioned there were a few projects on the horizon, and having looked at our website the helmet project was of particular interest. Looking at our new found contact’s LinkedIn profile, we could ascertain that he was based quite locally, which meant we could arrange a meeting to discuss the project in more detail. This face to face meeting ultimately landed us the project of designing the helmets which were subsequently worn to victory this summer at the London 2012 Olympics by our sensational British cyclists. Fostering and developing relationships with key business decision makers is and always has been a key element to the Crux growth story.

Should that be every professional’s goal, too? This week – to the delight of writers and editors everywhere – LinkedIn’s focused on the power of words. In some of the most widely-shared posts, they described how language can be used to , , and, yes, even . The attention to words began with a post from IDEO CEO Tim Brown, who revealed the “ ” that can get a team to think creatively. The phrase itself is simple: “How might we?” But Brown says uttering those words at the start of a project can help any group solve a challenge. The “how,” for example, indicates that solutions exist. The “might” gives people freedom to suggest ideas that could work – or flop. And the “we” implies that everyone is working together. Those three words became popular across LinkedIn. But author Dan Pink, in his , argued that presidential candidates – and everyone, for that matter – should aim to be even more succinct. Pink dug into the principle of : the idea that, in today’s blizzard of tweets, texts and news, everyone should boil a message down to a single word. President Barack Obama achieved that in 2008 with his iconic theme of “hope.” Governor Mitt Romney could go with the two-syllable “better.” Yet professionals also need to think about the concept. If you have a career, company or a movement you care about, Pink says, you need to be able to pick one word to be associated with it. Just be careful about what that word is. Restaurant consultant and author Clark Wolf criticized this week, noting that words such as  \"artisan\" are now being used to describe everything from Domino’s Pizza to a well-crafted piece of cheese. He advocates a return to a time when certain words “glowed with the magic of angelic good intention.” The need for that kind of nuance is essential with the spoken word, too. LinkedIn’s CEO Jeff Weiner mapped out his , urging speakers to know their audience – and the topics they care about – and to recognize when only a joke will save a presentation. Don’t take my word for all of this. Have a look at those posts, and six others that caught our eye this week: Neither presidential candidate has spent much time discussing technology, even with so much focus on the economy and jobs. Why not? Thompson, the editor of , says issues like patent reform and H1B visas don't resonate in swing states, where manufacturing is king. There's another explanation, though: It's hard to explain complicated tech policies in a stump speech. Let’s face it: Offices can be soul-destroying. The space never changes. The time spent commuting is unproductive. And those 9-to-5 hours are illogical. Is there a solution? Gottschalk proposes some ideas, from desks on wheels to standing-only meetings. LinkedIn users share their own suggestions – and rants about offices – in the comments. American higher education is in trouble. A third of university presidents say the system is on the wrong track. Costs are rising. And just about 50 percent of students who enter college leave with a bachelor’s degree. Why? Selingo compares colleges to newspapers and the music industry, and points to schools’ biggest problems: hubris and skepticism. When Huffington recently returned from the hospital with a new hip, she learned some important lessons. No. 1: It’s impossible to learn to walk again and to answer emails at the same time. No. 2: Blood donations are a very good thing. The founder of Panera had an idea to start a pay-what-you-want café to address hunger. The challenge: making it happen. Shaich takes readers behind the scenes of Panera Cares, and describes how the concept came to life through company volunteers, frequent iterations and lots of flying “under the corporate radar.” It’s a well-worn phrase on the campaign trail: \"Jobs will come from innovation.” Clifton, the CEO of Gallup, says that’s wrong.

If your dream employer appears on this list, you’re certainly in good company. But it also means you’re up for some intense competition. What does it take to land a job at one of the world’s most sought-after employers? Here are some tips: Yes, it can be challenging to apply to a top organization, but don’t take yourself out of the running before you take the first step. The very first step in landing a job with your dream employer is believing it’s possible. You’ll never get a job you don’t apply for. That said, you have to be realistic about what opportunities you pursue. Just because a company is popular doesn’t mean it’s the right career or cultural fit for you. Take time to thoroughly research a potential employer by exploring that organization’s website and reading through its LinkedIn . The “Careers” tab of any Company Page will provide information about that organization’s culture, and the company’s status updates -- which you can follow by clicking the “Follow” button in the upper right hand corner of any Company Page -- will alert you to the organization’s current news and priorities. I also recommend following a potential employer’s competitors (which you can generally find under the Insights tab of the Company Page under “People Also Viewed”). Research how a potential employer compares to its rivals in terms of culture, services, career opportunities and more. If you prefer another organization’s activities and positioning, then perhaps that company is your dream employer instead. To further determine a good fit with a potential employer, visit the “Insights” tab of an organization’s Company page and research areas like the top skills of its employees (Do you share some of these skills?) and the “Products and Services” tab (Do you have experience or interest in one or more of the company’s core business areas?). For more information beyond the Company Page, conduct an and type the name of the organization in the “Company” box and the job function you aspire to have, e.g., marketing, operations or product management, in the “Title” box. Then click “Search,” and LinkedIn will display the profiles of people who work in your functional area at that organization. Click through to some of these profiles and research what education these people have, what experience they list, what skills and expertise they possess and what professional credentials they hold. This will provide great insight into what that employer looks for in its employees. If your LinkedIn profile contains similar information to the people you find, then you’re likely a good candidate for a job at this organization. If not, you may have to acquire additional skills, or perhaps pursue other organizations that are a better fit for your current credentials. When I ask recruiters at highly sought-after employers what it takes to land a job at their companies, they say, “Connections always help.” There is simply no better way to get a foot in the door of a “hot” employer than to know someone who works there. Again, Company Pages are your go-to resource. The top right corner of the page, under the “Follow” button, will tell you “How You’re Connected” to any organization. If you have a 1 degree connection, reach out to ask your contact for advice about applying to the organization. You might write a message that says something like, Don’t directly ask for a job or referral until you’ve had a chance to learn more about the company from an insider and to tell that person why you think you’re a great fit. If you have a 2 degree connection, you can ask for a LinkedIn introduction from your shared connection. You might say something like this: If you’re not connected to an employee of your Dream Company, then check out your university alumni network, using the , and see if any fellow alums are employed there. If you’re both members of your university’s alumni LinkedIn group, you can reach out with a message like this: Your primary goal in these initial conversations is to learn more about the company and what it takes to land a job there. Your secondary goal is to impress your contact so much that he or she offers to pass along your resume or LinkedIn profile and put in a good word with the recruiter on your behalf!

LinkedIn’s have a slightly different take. In some of this week’s , they emphasized that employers – not educators – need to do more to train employees and help put people back to work. IDEO CEO Tim Brown reflected on the , noting that such programs have largely disappeared over the past few decades as companies have shifted the burden of training workers onto schools. “The retreat of apprenticeship,” Brown notes, “has coincided with a change in attitude of many employers … toward an expectation that the education system should ‘manufacture’ the right ‘product’ for them to employ.” But companies may have to take back some of that responsibility. Professionals in fields such as software development, design and even entrepreneurship could all benefit from on-the-job help, Brown says – not necessarily more classroom instruction. The Chronicle of Higher Education’s editor-at-large, Jeff Selingo, also the need for apprenticeships and new models of job preparation this week. To put young people to work, he says America should embrace structured, vocational training, and stop clinging to the idea that a four-year college campus is the only destination after high school. Even Richard Branson waded into the discussion over the skills gap – or at least a lack of knowledge in one area. He business leaders for their dismal social media presence, questioning why only 16 percent of CEOs use social sites. The post struck a nerve with LinkedIn users, who posted more than 300 comments in just a few hours after Branson published. Many agreed that the c-suite social-media “lethargy” had to stop. Here’s a look at eight other posts that caught our eye this week. Take a look, and then do Branson proud by sharing and commenting on these stories in your own networks: Enough with the rants against airlines. Yes, planes are full, overhead space is limited and service can be surly. But traveling is getting better, El-Erian says. Technology now lets us change seats, request upgrades and print boarding passes at home. The growing availability of Wifi and DirectTV means we rarely have to disconnect. And the food? Well, even the “Tapas” snack boxes are tempting. The days of Media Gods speaking from high, telling us what to care about are long gone. We’re now in a participatory media world, but that’s just one mega-trend worth following. Huffington also exposes the “snake in the garden,” and describes how we’ll all soon be using more technology to get away from technology. Can science make our foods more wholesome? The celebrity chef gives readers a glimpse into the future, demonstrating how centrifuges, liquid nitrogen and other tools can improve the taste, and healthiness, of food. The advancements may even extend to an almighty American favorite: mac-and-cheese. Samuelsson explains how sodium citrate, a popular salt compound, gives high-quality cheese creaminess -- making the fake, processed cheese obsolete. Companies are rolling out the pink products to show their support for breast cancer awareness. Yet consumers are increasingly skeptical of corporations’ intents. Andresen has lots of advice for marketers, starting with this: “Make that pink see-through.\" Where is the housing market really recovering? Burns and his colleagues take a deep dive into the data and find – surprise! – Texas is booming. But previously weak markets like Orlando and Las Vegas are also emerging as construction hotbeds. Here’s why. Pickens was pleased to see a long discussion of energy policy at Tuesday’s debate. One quibble? President Obama oversold the potential of renewable energy; two-thirds of our oil is used for transportation, and wind and solar can’t power 18-wheelers, he says. Forget the office.

I did it for more than 35 great years and performed 22,000 operations. In 2004, the pulled me out of the operating room and gave me a new assignment. They made me president and CEO of the second largest private medical practice in the world. At an age where many people are considering retirement, I was handed a whole new career. The change from surgeon to CEO was enormous. In just a few short months, I went from the operating room to the boardroom, from wearing a mask and gloves, to wearing suits and ties, from manual labor to cerebral labor, from a job where I got immediate results, to a job where results can take months or years to develop, from certainty to ambiguity, from reading the to . There were some excellent people helping me make the transition. Jack Welch, the former CEO of GE, and Michael Porter of Harvard Business School, have given me good advice over the years. So have our trustees, directors and donors. There was no underestimating the size and complexity of what needed to be managed. The Cleveland Clinic is a $6 billion dollar a year business. It pumps $3.5 billion into the local economy annually. After eight years, I’ve got a fairly good handle on the job. The key is continual learning. Meeting new people. Hearing new ideas. For instance, some years ago I heard a young guy at the World Economic Forum at Davos talking about something called “social media”. His name was Zuckerberg. I came back and asked our internet people to look into it. Today, Cleveland Clinic’s Facebook fan base is 100,000 and rising. We also have the . Healthcare reform, the epidemic of chronic disease and the rising cost of care will continue to challenge us all. I expect to be learning more and working harder in years to come. All of this proves that there are indeed second acts in American lives. In one way or another, my experience will be duplicated by many more of you going forward. The concept of retirement is obsolete. People aren’t disappearing at age 65. They’re becoming more visible than ever. And it’s a good thing. We’re not put on earth to observe life. We need to contribute. As Coach Lou Holtz said, “It’s how you meet the challenge of the second half that determines what you’ll be after the game – the winner or the loser.” And of course Mark Twain put it best: “Age is an issue of mind over matter.

This week, LinkedIn’s took on some of the nation’s problems -- big and small -- and dished up thoughtful advice on how to solve them. Jeff Selingo, the editor at large at The Chronicle of Higher Education, argued that college students should and focus on finding quality faculty to get ahead. Cleveland Clinic CEO Dr. Delos Cosgrove identified the “ ” to bringing down healthcare costs: focusing on the $2.8 trillion spent annually on preventable diseases.

Far too many have focused on making money, without thinking about doing anything good. Can that change? Shaich describes the success of Panera Cares cafes, a concept where diners can go to a restaurant and pay whatever they want for a meal. If Apple, Google or UPS used their knowledge of design, search and logistics in similar ways, Shaich wonders, what would happen? News that Wyclef Jean’s charity in Haiti effectively shut down last month amid an ongoing New York attorney general's investigation raises an important question: Should celebrities start their own charities? Lublin says famous entertainers have the right intentions, but often lack the expertise and time to make nonprofits successful. Her plea to celebs: Before starting new organizations, “call me maybe.” If you’ve ever walked into a massive furniture showroom and experienced an immediate sense of dread, you'll understand this theory. Research reveals that customers feel imposed upon when faced with thousands of choices (or couches). So, for marketers, there’s an obvious lesson: Offer less, and watch your sales rise. Startups are like restaurants: even the good ones are doomed to fail. Why? Pozin explains how bad partners, broad ideas and a lack of resiliency all contribute to the death of new companies. Women have plateaued on the corporate ladder, Krawcheck says, occupying just 3 percent of CEO positions. That imbalance has spawned an industry of executive coaches and self-help books. But the discrepancy may be explained by a simpler reason: women are just tired. Accountants may not be fortune tellers, but they’re willing to make some bets about what will happen if the Bush-era tax cuts expire. Telberg breaks it all down in one easy-to-read guide that shows the most noteworthy income tax changes. Forget everything you’ve read about families being career killers. Huffington says children give professionals perspective, helping them to detach from the ups and downs of working life. Good news: Studies from Harvard Medical School and elsewhere agree. It’s a big question: Just how significant will China’s slowdown be? The country is facing a political transition, plus plenty of economic uncertainty. But El-Erian, the CEO of bond giant PIMCO, says he’s less pessimistic than others. Here’s why.

With 175 million members and a new member joining approximately every two seconds, LinkedIn is an excellent way to stand out in your field—if you know how to work it. Simply filling out your profile isn't going to cut it. Being a part of an online community means engaging regularly to make an impact. Here's how. Professionals who share articles or content with their LinkedIn network at least once a week are nearly more likely to be contacted by a recruiter for new opportunities than people who don’t share with their network. So ask your network a question via your status update like “I've got a new business pitch with Nike tomorrow. Does anyone have any contacts over at Nike?”. Or make a general comment like “I'm heading to the airport for a client meeting in Denver.” Remember it’s about quality over quantity because every status update you share is a reflection of who you are as a professional.

This does not just refer to how we are creating economic opportunity for professionals worldwide, but also how we develop our own employees and help them become better professionals. LinkedIn’s Rotate[In] programme is a pilot initiative currently running in Dublin, Ireland that aims to do just that. Similar to , this programme involved some of our employees swapping roles, departments and desks to gain invaluable and in-depth experience of the organisations that are driving our business. A brainchild of the Dublin leadership team, this eight month rotation programme began in March this year and has already been a huge success, providing the three chosen pilot participants with a whirlwind experience of education and career development. They’re now six months in, and here are some highlights from each of them. : Before Rotate[In], I admit that I thought of Sales and Customer Operations to be completely different entities to each other, and to Finance. I saw little correlation and even fewer similarities. Even during the early stages of the programme, I found both departments to be extremely different to the role I did in Finance in terms of the actual day-to-day. Yet as the programme draws to a close, my grasp on LinkedIn’s business operations as a whole has been immensely refined and I have been struck by how the three departments are essentially all one under the same operational umbrella, providing world class support. Every deal that LinkedIn closes must pass through Credit, Order Management and Enterprise Services meaning that all three support functions collaborate daily and all play a vital role in the process of each and every booking – something I never even thought of when my sole focus was on the individual contribution of my own function. Having gone through this programme and acquiring a broader view of our business, I feel equipped to be a more valuable business partner, to make the right decisions for the company and not just for me, and ultimately to act like an owner. : It has been an amazing experience for me, from the insights I’ve gained to the projects I worked on to the people I learned from. Being trusted to look after Accounts Payable for our Asia Pacific region was both challenging and rewarding. I was selected by management to train a new team member in Singapore. To be considered “the go to guy” after only a couple weeks made me immensely proud of how adaptable I could be. Only at LinkedIn do I think I would been afforded this opportunity. Having been through this program, the knowledge I’m gaining will hopefully give a return for LinkedIn for the investment they have made in me. To have more than a layman’s knowledge about different departments is a huge advantage to me in my career as I strive to become a business leader someday. : Within the relatively short span of eight months, I had the opportunity to learn about parts of the business that I otherwise would not. I started the program in Order Management and have now moved on to Accounts Payable. Supported by my manager and the team I took on projects that have greatly expanded my insight in how the business is run. It also helped me develop a more analytical approach to my work, something that will surely be beneficial when spotting trends in the Customer Support queues. One of the highlights for me has been learning from different managers and colleagues and taking on different roles. I’ve had a huge amount of personal development over the last six months; this in no small thanks to the people I’ve worked with and the managers I’ve learnt from. Obviously learning new systems doesn’t hurt either and while the ramping up period for each job is hectic, it is also very rewarding. The whole experience has been great; from meeting and getting to know people in the other departments to gaining a deeper understanding of the different business areas. Wherever my career takes me, this will definitely give me the chance to develop into a more well rounded professional and individual."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Life"],"author":"Carine Syriani","title":"Discovering Generosity on LinkedIn inDay [SLIDESHOW]","date":"September 27, 2012","content":"LinkedIn is a special day each month when employees are encouraged to work on inspirational projects and invest in our career paths.

Never eat alone. Celebrate the small wins. Work Hard, Be Nice. Stay Focused and Keep Executing. After graduating from UIUC in May, I took a three month holiday and started my first full-time job at LinkedIn. Having just completed one month as an Associate Product Manager working in the team, I wanted to share some of the lessons I have learned from my peers and mentors so far: Be very curious in your work. You're new only once, so make sure you ask a lot of questions, challenge the standard models and intently listen to all the feedback/answers you get. Being an active listener not only applies to listening to other people, but also to your own thoughts. As my favorite entrepreneur Elon Musk says: \"I think it’s very important to have a feedback loop, where you’re constantly thinking about what you’ve done and how you could be doing it better.\" Hat tip: Use a tool like in every meeting to write down all the important talking points and takeaways. Brought up in a large family that always ate their meals together, I made it a personal rule to never eat lunch alone in college and now at work. Reach out to other people in your team and then slowly to people not in your team to eat lunch together. Lunch is also a great way to learn what's happening in other parts of the organization and learn best practices on processes. Another key part of team building is to celebrate the small wins in your team like record sales and project releases. I have realized that giving donuts are a great way to get people to participate in surveys and get feedback on your projects. I asked my eldest brother for some advice for my first full-time job and he wrote just four words in his email reply: \"Work Hard, Be Nice\". Be very passionate about your work and be thankful to the people who take time out to help you get up to speed with the different acronyms and projects. That lesson from my brother and two other lessons (see below) have had the most impact on my work ethic: Be very rigorous in your self analysis, certainly being extremely tenacious, and just work like hell.  - Elon Musk A great Product Manager should have the Brain of an Engineer, Heart of a Designer and Speech of a Diplomat. - The best way to understand a product, a team or a process is to \"learn by doing\". Ask your manager/mentor to give you a small but meaningful project that you can lead from start to finish. This will help you understand the different teams that you will be working with for future projects, the various processes that are required to release something and give you a project to \"hang your hat on\" until the next big project. As Alec Baldwin says in the movie Glengarry Glen Ross, \"Always be Closing, Always be Shipping\" In just one month at LinkedIn, I have learned a lot about the advertising business, worked with the smartest people in the industry and enjoyed a ton working on exciting projects! It has been an incredible adventure so far and there’s more to come, so stay tuned."},{"post_categories":["International"],"author":"Ali Matar","title":"Opening Our Doors in the Middle East","date":"September 30, 2012","content":"Today, we open the doors to our office in Dubai – the first LinkedIn office in the Middle East.

In the spirit of LinkedIn’s latest study of all the old-school staples that are dying a slow death, here are three rules for ensuring that you don't face extinction in a crowded career landscape where only the fittest survive. : So I just did a quick web search for “career experts” and found search results for 339,000,000. While not all of these are actual people, I can safely assume (as you should in your industry) that I am dispensable. And while this reality can be very scary, it can also be really motivating when you start to wrap your head around the strategies and technology available to help you make it to the top of your professional food chain. There are two parts of the “expert” equation. The first is the acquisition of information (both from meaningful resources and experiences) and the second is its dissemination. LinkedIn can help with both. Each and every day you need to make it your job to be as informed as possible. saves you time and energy by serving you the most current and crucial industry news. Whether it be in a meeting, around the water cooler or via a discussion, the more informed you are, the more likely you are to be bestowed with a legitimate expert ranking from both your peers and a Google search.

No bio on the company website. No . And via a mutual connection, you guessed it, no job. Presence has always been a good thing in terms of survival in the workplace, but as the economy has become increasingly competitive and technology more prevalent, not only is it critical not to hide in the face of survival…you need to be very, very easily found. : The Rolodex is dying because a network is infinitely more than a plastic contraption jammed with business cards. Your survival is based upon the relationships you form—and this isn't a contest of popularity but of influence. The number one question I'm asked when people learn I work with LinkedIn is, \"Do I have to accept all the connection requests that are sent to me?\" The answer is: no. The second most frequently asked question I get is, \"How did you get this job?\"  The answer is: through a trusted connection. The point here is, regardless of how cute (thinking chimpanzees) and talented we are, we all need a Jane Goodall in our lives. Professional survival requires a community to support our growth, invest in our development, watch our backs, sing our praises and fight for us when we need it."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Kerry Hannon","title":"5 Steps for Older Workers to Succeed in the Job Hunt","date":"September 26, 2012","content":"If you’re a seasoned professional who’s looking for work, you’re not alone. In , three-fourths of respondents stated that they plan on working past age 65. My friend Bill, 54, who currently has a part-time gig, but has been aggressively looking for a full-time job for months, called to tell me he had heard of the “perfect” job at a great company. Problem was, he wasn’t sure he knew anyone working there who might be able to get his virtual resume noticed. “Without a real connection, it’s like sending a message in a bottle, or shooting an arrow in the air,” he told me. and see if he knew anyone at the firm. Bingo. He did. He sent a quick email to his connection asking for help. Within a half-hour, he received a note back, and got the ball rolling. LinkedIn has resulted in some leads for me, and lots of other job seekers. It's pretty cool to get approached for work from someone you don't know, but somehow are connected to. Most professional job searches these days are at least started on the Internet. Yes, the big job boards are worth trolling, but if you’re a serious job hunter, you need more information than just a job posting—you need to dig deeper to research and network before you blindly shoot off a resume. And that’s where online networking sites can step up your game. I’m a big fan of online networking sites. They make it easier for recruiters to learn about you, and for you to learn about their companies – both essential ingredients to landing a job. For workers over 50, an online presence is also a way to show potential employers that you’re not intimidated by technology – something they’re wary of when considering an older worker for a job today. As I write in my new book, AARP’s , if you’ve recently lost your job, or aren’t at ease with online networking, learning the new rules of job hunting can take some ramping up, but do it. Here are five simple steps to get you started. Include your full name, such as johndoe@email.com. Send this e-mail to your contacts and tell them of your new job status. Be bold, and ask them to keep you in mind if they hear of any openings, or know someone you should reach out to for advice.  with a and your , education, . If you already have a profile, give it a facelift. LinkedIn is hands-down my business site. I view my profile there as my working resume. You should, too.

AARP’s Work Reimagined leverages LinkedIn’s API to help job hunters find information and job openings. Sign up for customized job alert postings in your field of interest. Tip: Write a personal note when you ask someone to connect with you. It’s friendly way to remind someone of how you know one another. Follow people or companies where you might want to interview. For your username, use your actual name or a shortened form. Include a bio – where you live and what kind of work you do. It has to be short and to the point — only 140 characters. By following tweets, you can get the scoop on people you may wind up interviewing with and stay on top of a potential employer’s news. You can also share ideas and tips with other job seekers. Plus, you’re expanding your network. Participate in online job real-time chats and comment in industry group discussions. You can find information about employment trends and firms that are hiring and network with recruiters and other job seekers."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn for Students","Jobs"],"author":"Lindsey Pollak","title":"The Best Way to Network with Alumni on LinkedIn","date":"September 20, 2012","content":"If you’ve been feeling the urge lately to buy fresh pencils and open the first page of a crisp new notebook, you’re not alone. Whether you graduated two years ago or 20, September always feels like the beginning of a new school year. For job seekers, this sense of a new beginning can inspire you to inject new energy into your hunt. In particular, the fall season is a nice time of year to reconnect with members of your college or university alumni community, who may be feeling nostalgic for their school days as well (particularly if you have a good football team!). Here are some tips for connecting and reconnecting with fellow graduates of your alma mater: The first essential step is to become a member of your university’s alumni group on LinkedIn. Virtually every college and university in the world has one or more, as do many high schools as well. Go to the and search for the name of any educational institutions you attended. You’ll find that some schools have multiple groups, so join as many as appeal to you. Once you’re a member, scan the group’s Discussions, Members and Jobs for networking opportunities. For instance, join a discussion of fellow alums talking about your industry, comment on an article someone has posted or introduce yourself to the Group Manager, who is often a representative of the Alumni Association (often a very connected and helpful person). You can also start your own discussion, perhaps posting an article with a few personal comments or posing a question to group members. Or, you can introduce yourself and your goals: “Hi fellow Tigers: I’m new to the group and excited to connect with fellow alums. I’m currently looking for a job as a graphic designer and eager to connect with any other job seekers or design folks. Happy to help anyone I can. Thanks!” Remember also that LinkedIn permits you to send a message or connection request to anyone with whom you share a group on LinkedIn (as long as that person has opted to accept such messages), which will help you build one-on-one relationships with individual group members. Your next stop should be , a tool that provides you with information about where your fellow alums work, what they do and where they live. The tool pre-fills the years you attended a school listed on your LinkedIn profile and shows you the classmates who attended at the same time. For a broader search, you can enter additional graduation years. You can look at the big picture of where people work and live, then you can narrow the results according to your goals. Let’s say you are looking for a job in public relations at a university or nonprofit organization in the Chicago area. The tool helps you narrow your vast alumni network to those who live in Chicago and work in public relations. Then, you can scan the list of “Where they work” and find the universities and nonprofits where your fellow alums are employed. LinkedIn Alumni will then show you the exact profiles of the alums who fit all of your criteria. Considering a move to Milwaukee? Just start a new search and click on that region under “Where they live” and all of the data will change to show you fellow alumni in that geographic region instead. If you attended more than one university, you can use the \"change school\" feature at the top of the page to explore other colleges and universities. Once you’ve identified some alums in your desired field and location, it’s time to make contact. While there are no guarantees, fellow alums are more likely to reply to a networking request than random strangers because you share a common experience. Here is how I would approach an outreach message:    Note that the message immediately mentions the alumni connection, is polite and professional and shows that you’ve done your research on the other person (signifying that you’re not just sending out generic blast messages). You never want to sound desperate and you never want to ask directly for a job or to send a resume. The goal here, as with any good networking message, is to establish rapport and ask for general information and advice. Networking with alumni is an effective and often very enjoyable form of networking for job seekers. Have you had success networking with alumni on LinkedIn?

And get this – it doesn’t have to take years to attain. The quickest and most effective way to be identified as an expert is to act like one. Your name should be synonymous with skill, authority and know-how in your industry. Set business standards by frequently and leading discussions about essential industry news. Be the influencer that your peers look up to. Is a merger occurring among two leading businesses? Is there a great conference you’ll be attending? Did you just listen to a great TED talk?  These seemingly innocuous tasks act as advertising for your brand. If people see you as a trusted and educated leader in your industry, they’ll think of you when they (or someone else) needs your product or service. : So your business is in the black and your customer flow is constant. Think you’re ready to sit back and relax? Not quite. To be a successful business owner means that you’re not only on top of what’s going on in your industry, you’re in front of it. If like most small and medium-sized businesses you don’t have an enormous budget for R&D, I have great news for you: you don’t need one. and let their research dollars do the talking. Everything from company news to the comings and goings of key people will tell you an enormous amount about what your competitors have in the pipeline (and alternate directions you may want to consider). Another amazing way of both saving and making more money? The old fashioned made new (and cheap) by virtue of technology, and the fact that legitimate professionals building their own reputation are eager to give their two-cents worth. : This is a true story. Three weeks after my baby was born, after one too many nights of 3am wake-ups, I logged onto LinkedIn sure I was going to find the night nurse that a fellow working mom friend had told me about. I could remember her name, but little else in my sleep-deprived stupor. Guess what? I couldn’t find her, but, unfortunately for her, I did find a handful of other well-qualified candidates. We're a very whim-oriented society in need of immediate satisfaction. It’s your job as a SMB to be as accessible as possible. If a customer can’t find you online, then you’ve got a big problem. Make sure your company has a with a great overview that includes a tab. If you’re a night nurse, your personal and include like , , and . The more specific you are, the better. Don’t miss out on potential clients because your name isn’t out there. Online professional networking is the new Yellow Pages – make sure you’re listed."},{"post_categories":["Member Stories","LinkedIn Tips"],"author":"Sourov De","title":"Winning More Business on LinkedIn","date":"September 14, 2012","content":"Can LinkedIn help a new business win more clients? We asked ourselves this question four years ago when we started our marketing firm . Back in 2008 when Stryve Group was in start-up mode we didn’t have a big fancy marketing budget. Much like any other business starting out, we had to figure out how to market ourselves to win more clients in the most efficient way. So we turned to a couple of marketing tools in our toolbox to get our name out there. First, we created a list of people in our network that we thought could benefit from our services and called or emailed them to tell them how Stryve Group could help solve their marketing dilemmas. This was a slow and manual process. We thought to ourselves what a dream it would be if our ideal clients would just call us instead. The other tool in our marketing toolbox was (at the time) a “new hip” way of marketing using social media to connect with ideal clients. Our target clients are Marketing and Sales VPs or Managers and we knew that we were most likely to connect with these professionals over LinkedIn. So we focused on building our visibility on LinkedIn before any other social network in our social media marketing efforts. Here are the three steps we took: We made sure each Stryve Group team member had LinkedIn profiles that would stand out and get noticed. We thought about the information our target clients would like to see on our employees' LinkedIn profiles and built content that aimed to answer typical questions such as, “What does Stryve Group do?” and “How is Stryve Group different than other marketing firms?”. We even put a on our LinkedIn profile that explained what a client engagement with Stryve Group looked like. When clients came through our LinkedIn profile, I didn’t have to spend time convincing them we were a company that could help them. We joined groups where other Marketing and Sales Managers or VPs congregated like , and .  We participated in discussions within these groups, so that each time we commented on discussion posts with our opinion or helpful marketing tips, Stryve Group was becoming more credible in the eyes of our target market on LinkedIn. After participating in other groups for a while, Stryve Group started a group called with the vision of creating a place where Canadian marketing professionals could connect and discuss social media trends as they related to the Canadian market specifically. Creating SMMC meant providing an excellent place to connect Canadian marketing professionals with one another as well as giving Stryve Group a public forum to answer the overwhelming amount of social media questions that were pouring in from potential clients. We were aiming to be helpful to Canadian marketing professionals and in doing so, Stryve Group was becoming more credible and visible to our target market—a win-win scenario. So, back to my original question, did our efforts on LinkedIn help us win more clients? We went from a new start-up marketing firm in 2008 to now doing business with clients such as Xerox, Intel and TD Bank. Our most recent client to sign on as a client was Intel and when I asked our contact at Intel how he found us, he replied, \"I typed in Social Media Marketing Canada into Google, found you on LinkedIn and gave you a call”. Am I dreaming?! Because of a little hard work to get our name out there on LinkedIn, our ideal clients were now calling us. *HIGH FIVE-FIST BUMP* LinkedIn definitely has helped our company win ideal clients. Using the steps above, I hope it does the same for yours."},{"post_categories":["Featured","Infographic"],"author":"Ariel Eckstein","title":"Hey UK, You’re One in 10 Million!

What?! Mountain View is covered with free Wi-Fi? And the shuttle, which stops at main technology companies in the city, is also free? What?!

It leverages the LinkedIn API and contains features to handle idea creation, such as handling slides and video content, as well as features like search, voting, commenting and tagging to enable engagement and participation by the whole company.

Crazy ideas aren’t so crazy. People are encouraged to come up with new out-of-the-box ideas and managers tend to support these new ideas. A perfect example of this was when Sharon approached me about doing a job swap – including swapping cars and houses too! At one point, I was worried and joked with her about wanting to swap families too (like the TV show “Wife Swap”). : I came up with this idea while having a conversation with Rich on how we globalize at LinkedIn. And it wasn’t so crazy! We are a fast growing global company, we both report directly to the CFO and both of our roles depend on us having relationships with teams all over the world. Working in each others' offices and with each others’ teams would help us be more effective in our roles. Most importantly, this idea fit perfectly with the company culture of transforming ourselves and the company. : After Sharon pitched the idea, I jumped on it.  From a professional perspective, this was an opportunity to expand from my current job and dive deep with the sales teams in Europe and the international financial operations team in Dublin. And personally, it was a great opportunity for my family to live in Ireland and experience European history and culture. : After Rich agreed, we spent months exchanging ideas, discussing work projects and training each other in our jobs. My family was very excited especially for the California summer (sun, yeah!), Rich’s house and his pool. I definitely felt like I got the better end of the job swap. : It was quite complicated to organize between schooling for the kids and keeping them entertained. In the process of sharing and planning for this swap, Sharon got to know my wife pretty well. My work and personal lives collided and I really started to worry when my wife started telling me things about Sharon I didn’t even know, like where she was traveling to on business. : The adventure began in July, and the California sun did not let me down. We enjoyed a beautiful summer and I had some amazing work experiences. All of the folks on Rich’s team were fantastic and inclusive. Humor is a core part of our company culture, and I found out quickly that his team definitely keeps this part of the culture alive. One of the projects I worked on included assisting the Procurement team in finding a new global travel provider, a personal interest as a frequent flier! The timelines and interactions are very different in headquarters which made every day exciting and broadened my perspective. : The Irish weather did not cooperate with us – it rained 28 of the 30 days I was in Europe. I went to Ireland with no rain gear, but left with four umbrellas AND we ended up buying raincoats for the whole family. My kids had to raid Sharon’s closets for winter wear because we weren’t prepared for anything but California sunshine. I joined a customer call with one of our strategic accounts in Ireland, and participated in the EMEA/LatAm mid-year sales training. The EMEA sales team is amazing and Sharon’s team was fantastic – and I got to know all of them on a much deeper and personal level! My kids took full advantage of all that California had to offer from Universal Studios to Lake Tahoe to the Exploratorium. I got to travel with my family which was a pleasure and a massive learning experience. My daughter was born on the 4th of July and she realized that an entire country celebrates her birthday with fireworks (how cool is that!). I feel extremely fortunate to have had this phenomenal opportunity. There is nothing better than working someone else’s job, living in their house and driving their cars!  I have a much better understanding of some of the international challenges Sharon deals with and my perspective has become much more global as a result. My greatest learning was one which I had not considered. By walking in someone else’s shoes (or in my case driving on Route 101 in someone else’s car), you get a whole new sense of perspective of not only the technical role but the leadership role that someone else plays. My increased respect for Rich comes from just that."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Life","New LinkedIn Features","Jobs"],"author":"Vicki Slavina","title":"6 Steps to Shipping a Product to Your Most Important Customers","date":"August 24, 2012","content":"The largest marketing campaign I’ve ever worked on launched to tens of thousands of recruiters and hiring managers in July. But I’m a newbie here at LinkedIn! For a more seasoned LinkedIn marketer, that’s nothing as they are reaching out to millions of members everyday. This campaign was a part of my intern project this summer, which focused on the launch of Sponsored Jobs – a new product that allows companies to highlight job recommendations in ‘Jobs You Might Be Interested In’ or JYMBII (one of the many new acronyms I learned to spin with ease this summer). You’ve likely seen JYMBII on your LinkedIn homepage (and no, that is not my finger): JYMBII has already changed the way professionals find jobs. For example, based on my current role as a Product Marketer in Mountain View, CA, LinkedIn automatically shows me marketing jobs at various San Francisco Bay Area companies that I might also ‘be interested in,’ as the name suggests. This feature allows our members to discover new and relevant opportunities. JYMBII is responsible for more than half of the roles filled on LinkedIn. So how do you get the word out to the right people about a new product? Here are 6 steps I learned to take this summer: We spent hours brainstorming the most relevant recruiters and hiring managers to tell about  this product. We used our data to identify and target power users who would be excited about the new feature. Our customers were the ones who gave us the idea for this product. As we were approaching launch, we went back to ask them what they thought of our presentation of the product online, and made changes immediately. Luke Baxter, the Online Product Marketer for LinkedIn Jobs, and Sachit Kamat, the Product Manager for LinkedIn Jobs, met several times a day to ensure there is a product-market fit for every part of the member experience. This includes everything from relevance of job recommendations to feature names that resonate with members. When something is being launched to thousands of people, you better check the fine print. Again. And again. Then ask someone else to. Then, again. “Wouldn’t it be interesting to know how many members…?” Almost every conversation about members ended with me going back to my desk and to find the answer in our enormous data warehouse. Let me tell you – “big data” is really BIG. Tech is one of the only industries where you never have to hypothesize what could be better – just build both and let them fight it out in an A-B test! I have become such a testing addict this summer that I now want to test everything in my life. I even suggested to my housemate that she A-B test invitations for her upcoming wedding. (This might have gone a bit too far.) Just when you think you’re done, someone (often yourself!) will have a new idea for the ‘next play’.

If I told myself in the beginning of my internship that I would be working one-on-one with executives like , Senior Vice President of Product, and , Director of Design and Web Development, on a high impact project, I wouldn’t have believed myself. My fascination with the Internet and web development started over 15 years ago in middle school. I tinkered with HTML files and created small webpages for myself. Mostly self-taught by reading tutorials and a healthy dose of trial and error, I dreamed of one day helping to create products that would impact millions of lives in a positive way. My time here at LinkedIn gave me an opportunity to do just that as I built an internal website that helps the Product team at LinkedIn operate more efficiently and effectively so they can focus on building products that change people's lives. Not only did my internship fulfill one of my dreams, it gave me the mentorship, guidance, and camaraderie that I have long sought in my career. As part of the web development team, I was surrounded with 60+ like-minded individuals who embraced me as one of their own. It felt less like a team and more like family to me. Right off the bat, I was introduced to one of the many web dev traditions with the \"Wheel of Lunch[in]\" where new hires get to spin a wheel to decide where everyone gets to eat lunch that day. Whenever I had a question, one of the web developers would promptly reply or knew someone who knew the answer. The best indicator that I was truly a part of the web dev family came on the last day of my internship. One of the full-time web developers mentioned to me that he was surprised to learn that I was an intern since I had assimilated into the culture so well. My mentors, and , gave me the independence to make decisions and really make the project my own. Having the opportunity to talk one-on-one, eat lunch together, and even play ping pong with my mentors really gave me the chance to learn from their experiences both in and out of work. I would not trade what I gained from my time as a Web Developer Intern here at LinkedIn for anything. I am thankful for all of the connections I have made not only professionally, but also personally. I'll definitely miss my team here at LinkedIn.

These people are valuable members of your LinkedIn network and, ideally, will be happy to introduce you to potentially helpful contacts in their LinkedIn networks. However, there are some instances where you’ll want to reach out to people who are not at all connected to your existing network and are, in your estimation, Very Important People. Your VIPs may include recruiters, hiring managers, senior executives at prospective employers or “stars” in your industry. If you’re ready to network several rungs up the career ladder, here are some tips: VIPs are busy people, so if they receive a LinkedIn message from you and decide to check out your LinkedIn profile, chances are they’ll only spend a few seconds reviewing it. This means your profile has to be stellar. First, craft a profile headline that is very specific and sells your skills and uniqueness, such as “Deadline-driven copywriter with 10+ years of experience at top-tier ad agencies.” Next, make sure your profile is 100% complete so a potential employer can quickly understand your education, experience and key skills. Finally, quadruple check your profile for typos, grammar mistakes or “red flags” such as outdated certifications or unexplained gaps in your experience. Before reaching out to anyone, but particularly to a VIP, thoroughly review the person’s LinkedIn profile. Take note of anything you have in common with this person, any recent changes in his or her employment or any recent status updates that might give you something to mention in your outreach. Doing your homework will increase your confidence and will ensure that you don’t make any big mistakes (such as asking the person what it’s like to work at a company he just left). If you have no connections in common with this VIP (and, therefore, cannot ask for an introduction from someone in your network), you will need to reach out by using an InMail credit (part of the ). Since the VIP will not recognize your name, you must write a subject line that compels the person to open your message. Here are a few suggestions: A big mistake people make when reaching out to network with VIPs is writing too long of an outreach message or being too vague. Remember that this is neither a cover letter nor your life story. You must be straightforward about who you are and what you are asking this person. And you must always show respect for the person’s time. Here is an example:     If you don’t receive a response to your InMail when you reach out to a VIP, don’t despair (and remember that the InMail credit will be replaced if you don’t receive a response). But I also recommend that you don’t follow up using the exact same method. To reach a busy VIP who may receive hundreds of emails and messages a day, try something different, such as commenting on a group discussion this person has posted, replying to a status update this person has shared (You can follow people you share Groups with on LinkedIn by clicking “follow” under that person’s photo) or even reaching out to another person at his or her organization to make a good impression and then ask for a referral to the VIP. Finally, remember to show your gratitude. If you are successful making contact with a VIP and that person offers you an informational interview or answers a few questions by email, don’t forget to send a gracious thank you message on LinkedIn. Even thought VIPs are busy, they will always appreciate (and expect) a polite and timely thank you note. Good luck!"},{"post_categories":["International","Featured","Member Stories","Latin America"],"author":"Leonardo Brant","title":"Building a Digital Classroom on LinkedIn","date":"August 14, 2012","content":"After working in consulting with Brant Associates for over 15 years, I decided to change the course of my business to explore the creative economy in Brazil. In March 2010, I founded to help Brazilian professionals and entrepreneurs think creatively about their challenges. We started by building a physical space for networking to foster innovative thinking. We then did an extensive search for a digital space that could replicate the physical experience of a classroom, while extending the opportunity to network. Today, LinkedIn serves as this digital classroom where we exchange information and operate a meaningful community to share relevant knowledge. As I leveraged LinkedIn more, I realized that this network is even more powerful than I originally thought. I have used it to find and connect people with shared interests, promote interactive processes and fund audacious ideas. I also used LinkedIn to build our business even further, encouraging members of our LinkedIn Group RedeCemec to participate in LinkedIn's campaign in Brazil by sharing professional stories of their creative ventures. Professionals from all industries are spending more time on social networks, and it is no different with creative ventures like mine. Moving forward, I intend to concentrate more of my activities on LinkedIn, and encourage those I know to do the same. I believe LinkedIn is a network with excellent focus and results, capable of concentrating the energy of professionals to generate creative and sustainable businesses. This is my LinkedIn story. Like me, many other Brazilian professionals have been using LinkedIn to find people, discuss ideas and bring projects to life.

Everything was brand new to me, from carrying my new LinkedIn backpack to catching the work shuttle to walking around a beautiful campus surrounded by people who seemed truly proud and happy to work here. I thought to myself, “Is this a mirage?” because I came from an industry where a good number of people worked long hours and disliked their jobs. I was excited for the summer, and happy to be a part of LinkedIn’s first official season of the MBA Internship Program. Coming to work in jeans and a t-shirt everyday made me even more grateful. After nearly two months at LinkedIn, I am still intrigued by my work on the Sales Operations team. There are tons of projects for me to work on, from strengthening LinkedIn’s product offerings in different regions to improving the efficiency of the ordering process. While our engineers are hard at work creating the products and the sales team is building relationships with customers, my team is helping the sales team increase their effectiveness and productivity. We ask a lot of questions, and usually answer them leveraging the sea of rich data that LinkedIn has. Even though business schools don’t teach us how to code, they do give us powerful analytical tools that have proved applicable and invaluable for my current role. For those looking for complete order and structure, LinkedIn may not be that place, but that's what makes every day so exciting for me. I’m given plenty of freedom to work on new things and chart my own career. LinkedIn has done a great job maintaining a \"start-up\" feel even though we have thousands of employees globally. Employees still speak up at all-hands meetings and no suggestion is too small for senior management’s attention. The hypergrowth doesn’t make people here complacent. In fact, LinkedIn keeps rolling out and for all its members. No wonder tech companies have become business school students’ new favorite industry.

I am willing to believe it was when I read about how data drives products like Amazon’s Book Recommendation Engine or LinkedIn’s ‘People You May Know’. However, it has remained with me since, and here I am, interning with LinkedIn’s Data Science team. Simply put, Data Science enables the use of data to solve problems and create data-driven products like ‘ ’ or  ‘ ’. The rate at which we are producing and replicating data is estimated to double every two years. It is clear that the ability to take raw data, clean it, process it, extract value from it and derive a narrative from it is becoming an extremely important skill as we try to make sense of the world around us. In the context of consumer Internet companies, I believe the most important use of data is going to be around understanding how users interact with the product. Reid Hoffman in his book, “ ”, writes about how companies today are in “permanent beta”. This means that their products are never ‘finished’ but are constantly improving by iterating. In such a scenario, data science plays a crucial role of deriving insights from data and providing a direction for the product’s next iteration. I’ve had a phenomenal internship so far. A chance to work on exciting projects, meet amazing people and have a lot of fun at intern events. Here are five things I’ve learned during my internship: In a world that is changing at an accelerating pace, data will play a very important role in enabling companies to evolve faster. At LinkedIn, I have had a chance to witness this everyday as my colleagues make decisions driven by data. The future clearly belongs to companies that figure out a way to use their data successfully.

While U.S. employers added 200,000 jobs a month at the end of 2011 and into 2012, he noted that the numbers had since tanked; in the second quarter, only 75,000 jobs were added each month. Looking up from his prepared remarks, Bernanke declared a “loss of momentum in job creation.” That’s not a loss of momentum, that’s a crisis. . Everyday we read and see how that crisis rips through the country: families using up their savings; grads moving back home with career dreams deferred; the longtime jobless giving up hope. Twenty million people unemployed or underemployed. Though July’s jobs numbers showed a ray of hope — 163,000 new positions added — the unemployment rate didn’t budge at 8.3%. And on the other side are the companies who want to fill jobs and can’t. In May, there were 3.6 million jobs sitting vacant. The reasons range from companies being unable to find people with the right skills to employers being too picky.  LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner last year, and offered a 3-point plan. But the situation remains stubbornly unchanged. So how do you solve a crisis? How do you bring back momentum?  How do you get seemingly unfillable jobs filled? That’s where you come in.

The timing of this — launching in the heat of election season — isn’t, of course, a coincidence.

Finding a job when you’re not exactly sure what kind of job you want can be really, really hard. Perhaps you’ve recently graduated, you’ve been laid off from a shrinking industry or you just have a sense that you might be happier in a different career. If you find yourself asking, “What should I do with my life?” this summer, I recommend this 3-step strategy for using LinkedIn to research your career options:  1. Even if you’re really unsure of your career direction, I guarantee you have some ideas of what path or paths you want to pursue. Start collecting these ideas -- job titles, potential employers, hobbies, interests that might become a career, anything -- into a big list. Ask a few trusted friends or colleagues what they think you’re good at and what jobs they think you should pursue, and add these to your list. Reach out to your alma mater’s career services office and ask if they have a career assessment test you can take, then add these results to your list as well. It doesn’t matter if the items on your list are wildly different -- e.g., writing, Italy, Google, personal trainer. Just come up with the biggest list you can and keep adding to it as you follow the steps below. 2. Next, take your big list of career options and start typing each idea into LinkedIn’s . Just see what you find and keep following links that interest you. For instance, let’s start with “writing.”  You know you love writing and would like to consider it as part of your career, but you’re not sure what kinds of jobs exist, where they are and what kind of experience you need to get those jobs. Just type the word “writing” into the “keywords” box in LinkedIn’s Advanced Search tool and you’ll generate a listing of anyone on LinkedIn who has the word “writing” in his or her LinkedIn profile. Start to click on profiles that interest you and look for: 3. As you research your next career on LinkedIn, you’ll notice that some of the people or companies you come across are in your network, already share Group memberships with you or attended your university (check out to further research the career paths of alums from your school). Some of these people might be willing to share some inside scoop on their jobs and career paths -- information that can help you make your own career decisions. For instance, you might choose to reach out to five people who use writing in their careers. After reviewing the profile of a person whose career you admire, reach out to that person with an InMail or Introduction Request and ask for advice or guidance. Your note might read something like this: Note that this message is concise, polite, positive and specific. Don’t send a blast message or generic message -- you’re much more likely to receive a response when your message is tailored to each individual and shows you took the time to write a unique note. Now follow these same steps for any other interests from your big list. Every person may not respond, and you might realize that a particular interest or hobby isn’t really something you want to build a career around, but every bit of research and every conversation will bring you closer to your next job.

Now, I’ve been here for almost three months. Not only have I been able to explore the usual tourist attractions, but I’ve also been immersed in the culture and atmosphere of Silicon Valley. So what makes living in this area such a unique experience? 1. Buzz words are used correctly in everyday conversation For most people, conversation topics revolve around sports, movies, music, and other hobbies. But here in Silicon Valley, I often overhear heated discussions about the cloud, big data, , and social graphs... and the speakers actually know what they are talking about! Not only is it fun to work with people who live and breathe these popular buzz words, it is absolutely phenomenal to hear their excitement on the train, at restaurants, and on the bus wherever I go. 2. You’re always surrounded by swag, even on the weekends As a college student, I am hard-wired to collect as much company swag as possible. I mean really, who gives up free t-shirts when you’re on a college budget? But I was amazed last weekend when I saw more DropBox, Facebook, Mozilla, and of course LinkedIn and sweatshirts than I had ever known existed. Even here at LinkedIn, it seems like there is a different “In” or jacket for every team and event we can find an excuse to make swag for. 3. Paying real money for lunch is unheard of One of the popular perks of Silicon Valley companies is , either at an in-house cafeteria or via catering and food trucks as we have here at LinkedIn. In fact the practice is so ubiquitous that it doesn’t matter if I leave LinkedIn to visit a friend because chances are their company will have free lunch too. This is not to mention the fully stocked kitchens on every floor either, which is a whole other story... We’ve grown so accustomed to free food that there’s a point where actually paying (in the rare case where we go to a real restaurant for lunch) is the weirder experience. 4. Your daily commute includes seeing license plates like “GITPUSH” or “HTML5.0” (and you know what those references mean) During my internship this summer, I found myself sitting in traffic behind a car with a Google sticker that read “My other car drives itself”. I’ve seen the famous driverless cars in action cruising around Mountain View. And now when I see cars with license plates like “GITPUSH” parked next to me, I am barely fazed. Here at the heart of technology, it seems like every vanity plate or bumper sticker is a tribute to the exciting projects we’re building and the fun, nerdy culture we live in. 5. You can take a day trip, visit 10 major companies, and still be home for dinner Finally, Silicon Valley is called Silicon Valley first and foremost because it is home to so many of the world’s largest technology corporations and manufacturers. The best way to explain this last point is by simple demonstration, so follow me as I explore as many companies as I can in one day."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Events","LinkedIn Life"],"author":"Brooke Lopez","title":"InDay Games","date":"August 1, 2012","content":"On the second anniversary of inDay, and also Opening Ceremony Day of the XXX Olympics near our office in London, LinkedIn celebrated by holding our 2012 Global Office Games.  This global competition included participants from LinkedIn offices in India, Australia, Canada, Brazil, and the United States, who competed in events like Office Chair Races, Rubber Band Archery, and Wastebasket Shootout.

Clay not only has an incredibly intelligent and visionary mind, but he’s also a caring, thoughtful, and witty individual. I was fortunate enough to get a seat in his popular class at Harvard Business School, and to get to know him on a more personal level as a family friend. After being inspired by his most recent book, , where he takes his impactful business teachings and applies them to an individual’s personal life, I asked Clay to share his thoughts with my fellow colleagues at LinkedIn. [embed]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DwYcNr0Nuw[/embed] Speaking to a packed and riveted audience, Clay described his motivations for writing his most recent book. Over the last 30 years, Clay has been saddened to learn that many of his former classmates and colleagues – despite obtaining wealth and status – had broken families and messy personal lives. Several had even gone to jail. He realized you could avoid these outcomes if you apply his same impactful business theories to your personal life. Take Clay’s theory of disruption, which states “the pursuit of profit drives companies up-market, and moving towards affordability and accessibility seems less profitable.” Disruption happens as a result of many seemingly small decisions – decisions that are made with sound business sense. Companies tend to prefer selling products and services with high gross margins. But over time, this pursuit can lead to competitors coming in at the low margin levels, gradually moving up market, and eventually taking over the entire business. This happened most notably to the integrated steel mills in the 1980s, and continues to happen today to companies like Oracle (disrupted by Salesforce.com) and Toyota (disrupted by Kia and Hyundai). We are faced with the same decisions in our personal lives. As the overachievers that we are here at LinkedIn, we tend to use every free moment of our day to pursue an activity that will give us the highest level of tangible achievement – shipping a product, closing a sale. Dedicating free time to our family and friends doesn’t have the same immediate benefit. So we tend to invest time in our work, and plan to \"spend tomorrow\" with the family. Over time, these decisions can lead to, at best, unhappy families, but, at worst, broken homes. After Clay’s talk on Friday, I went home to spend some quality (yet not so rewarding, as she disobeyed my every request!) time with my daughter, in the hope that she and I can both reap the benefits in the long term. In his book, Clay writes “The type of person you want to become – what the purpose of your life is – is too important to leave to chance. It needs to be deliberately conceived, chosen, and managed.” Just as we have a stated mission at LinkedIn – to connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful – Clay has inspired me to have my own personal strategy. I plan to have a successful and happy career, to benefit from fulfilling relationships, and to live a life of integrity.

That’s why this post will delve into the benefits of —gathered from extensive use of LinkedIn Groups—to help you make the most of this social network! 1. Run a few LinkedIn searches to discover groups that would benefit your industry. If you’re in the business of recruiting, try joining networking groups. If your business falls under a     more general industry, look for associations. Here’s some example groups for learning more about effective marketing: 2. Many users’ first reaction when joining a group is to start multiple discussions promoting their own content. Problem is, nobody in this group knows who you are, and nobody has built trust with you. But if users continue to see you in the top five influencer list, they’ll see that you truly are a helpful Group member. Remember that Top Influencers are group members whose contributions cause the most contributions from other group members. Shoot for quality, not quantity. The Top Influencers ranking updates every 3 hours and resets completely every Sunday at midnight. 3. People want the reassurance that you’re in the group for engagement, not spam. Creating a poll can show users that you are truly interested in hearing opinions. A poll is an easy way to get users to know and engage with you. 4. Now that you’ve established your authority and reputation, start a discussion! There are three key components to starting a discussion. 5. include easy sharing buttons to not only share the group itself, but to also share individual polls and discussions. By sharing discussions, you’re extending the reach of those discussions by giving them more visibility and increasing engagement opportunities 6. There are a few free tools to help you measure the impact of your LinkedIn Groups participation. Employ Bit.ly links and tracking tokens to see how many people click on links you share. 7. Nothing on social media can be done just once, or twice. You have to be proactive and continue to test different methods of phrasing your message. Compare the results you’re receiving from LinkedIn Groups with other strategies you’re employing and analyze whether it’s truly worth your time. And if you do give it time, you’ll start seeing the results come through."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Life"],"author":"Maverick Lee","title":"Having fun and working hard at LinkedIn","date":"July 20, 2012","content":"When I started my internship at LinkedIn two months ago, I was promised a summer full of fun and exciting professional opportunities. LinkedIn has delivered on both fronts. As a summer intern, I hang out with hundreds of other like-minded people and engage in planned shenanigans every week. As a developer on the Cloud team, I work with the \"graph\" of LinkedIn, making sure the system to find and build new connections is always working. With hundreds of interns in a company of thousands, you would think it would be hard to meet every intern. Luckily, this has been taken care of for us in two ways: interns take up a giant table through the lunch hour (you can find us by our tshirts) and there are planned weekly intern events. I always meet and re-meet new people while having lunch (mileage varies depending on memory). The intern events are almost always on Fridays, so we end the week with some fun activity. Last week we had sushi making class, where we all learned to make California and caterpillar rolls. I ate all of mine right after making them, but most people had sushi for dinner. At the end of the class, we competed with each other making sushi using fruits and other wacky ingredients. Other past events include trampoline dodgeball, karaoke, and brown bag lunches with senior executives. Of course, having fun isn't restricted to interns, full-time employees get access to some fun things as well. We get the usual goodies: free lunch, arcade games, yoga classes and more. The two perks that stand out to me are Food Truck Fridays and . Food truck Fridays are great, but my favorite truck doesn’t come every week so I’m forced to try new food. I’m told that this is called a first world LinkedIn problem. inDays are a day each month where LinkedIn employees are given a day back to invest in themselves. It’s also the same day as our which a day we can drop our usual projects to play with any part of the site and show off our projects to the whole company. Hackdays are pretty standard at tech companies, but inDays always incorporate some sort of fun factor. Last month's theme was so we had rock climbing walls and bouncy castles. Needless to say, I got less hacking done than expected. As for actually working (interns do that too apparently), I had a lot of input into which project I eventually ended up working on. On my second day, my manager sat down with me and talked about a wide variety of projects and I got to pick the one that interested me the most. I started off alone, and was given free reign on what to do and how to implement the project. I've worked with an awesome designer and product manager, and I'm on my way to getting my product shipped out to millions of people. On the side, I'm helping out across different projects so I can get a feel for everything on my team. tldr: I work and have fun"},{"post_categories":["Engineering"],"author":"Hristo Oskov","title":"Intern Hackday 2012","date":"July 24, 2012","content":"I'm extremely fortunate to have been a part of LinkedIn's last summer. It was an incredible experience and easily the highlight of my summer. LinkedIn invited all Bay Area interns to participate, so I got to hack with students from top-tier universities all over the country and top-tier tech companies from all over Silicon Valley. We saw a variety of incredible hacks, including a 3D hardware-accelerated WebGL game ( ), a speaking artificial intelligence knowledge engine ( ), and a VNC Client implemented using only JS/HTML5 ( ). Here’s a taste of the creativity, energy, and innovation we saw last year: [embed]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUKFJUttBOo[/embed] LinkedIn went all out to make sure the hackday was as smooth and as fun as possible. Food was always coming in, even at 3am, and there were enough drinks and snacks to keep everyone caffeinated throughout the night. After hacking all night, each team presented their hacks; 15 teams were picked as finalists and got to present to guest judges , , and for a chance to win prizes (Macbook Airs and iPads). I was stunned to find out my team's hack was selected as one of the winners, placing in 3rd, and I felt truly honored when the judges recognized our work. We got to meet James Gosling (the creator of Java!), who suggested that we launch our hack: \"[...] some of the most successful companies started off as just a box [...]\".

I'm a Human Resources MBA intern supporting our Global Sales Organization. I’ve been amazed at the quality of folks that I work with at LinkedIn, especially the great people who surround me in the MBA Internship Program with students from Haas to Harvard. This week, I joined the Global Sales Organization at their training offsite in Monterey, CA. It was an insightful two days of learning how to sell and the perfect opportunity for me to bond and solidify my relationships with fellow interns. Since there were multiple sessions, I was able to leverage my intern network to exchange learnings from other sessions.  While I spent time with the team learning how to identify our customers’ true pain points, my fellow intern David spent time with the team building the skills needed to be a trusted advisor. By sharing our different experiences, we were able to learn about different parts of the Sales organization. Of course, sharing stories wasn’t all we did, we also built sand castles and made s’mores on the beach! I’ve also built incredible relationships with other interns through events planned by LinkedIn to take advantage of the California sunshine. This past weekend, a group of MBA interns went on a glorious tour of Napa Valley in a stretch SUV. On our way up, I talked to a few interns about how our current internships at LinkedIn were giving us interesting work experiences that will help us reach our career goals in the future. , a Marketing intern, is focused on making a significant impact while balancing work and life. , another Marketing intern, is getting valuable experience in big picture marketing. And for me, I want to work at a strategic organizational level. Since I know career success is built on genuine relationships like these, I’m so glad to know that I will be able to call on Emily or Brian for their marketing expertise. To continue this relationship building, we’ll be attending a sushi making class to learn how to roll and tomorrow we’ll be celebrating an intern’s birthday in San Francisco to see who knows how to rock! So far, LinkedIn has been a great place to connect with amazingly talented professionals as I grow my career. I know that the friendships I develop this summer at LinkedIn will be connections I’ll be able to count on for the rest of my career."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Nicole Williams","title":"How to be a Summer Standout","date":"June 28, 2012","content":"They don’t call them the lazy days of summer for nothing. Summer is the one time of year (aside from the much shorter holiday season) when everyone has numerous social obligations and is actively looking for ways to slack off. Weddings are standard, as are family vacations, reunions, barbecues, camping trips, concerts and festivals. Odds are that more than one person at work wants time off, usually to the boss’ chagrin (remember, he’s trying to leave town too!). Someone’s got to get the work done and the deadlines met on time. And that person is you. With your boss on vacation and your nemesis sporting baby doll dresses and flip flops, there are three simple ways to become a summer standout…without breaking a sweat. There are roughly 15 Fridays between Memorial Day and Labor Day. And while I don’t mean to be a killjoy here, the reality is you don’t need to take advantage of each and every one of them. In fact, while your co-workers are at the beach sleeping off Thursday night’s hangover, you can be getting A LOT accomplished in your very quiet office. Use this time to work on projects or pitches that you don’t have time to tackle during the week when the phone’s ringing off the hook and you’ve got back-to-back meetings. This quiet time is great to work on passion projects you’ve been too busy to focus on during the year. Need a focus group to see if you’re going in the right direction? Post a discussion in one of your to get your project off the ground. With perspective in place, your pet project will start taking shape. If you know a co-worker is so busy planning her wedding (hard to miss considering she isn’t talking about much else…) that she isn’t keeping up with her daily tasks, offer to take some of them off her plate. Listen and take careful notes in meetings about deadlines, projects, and clients so that you can be informed and ready to become involved at a moment’s notice. This is an amazing way of showing that you are ready for a promotion and banking a favor all at once. This is also a great time to try out new skills and dip your toe in a new department. If you’ve always had a hankering to try your hand at marketing, the summertime ‘HR hole’ gives you the time to step up. Keep your ear to the status update ground and stay on top of industry news on so you’re ready to jump in. Have you ever noticed that once summer hits, the office becomes a ghost town at 6 p.m.? Or that the lunch “hour” somehow stretches to two when it’s warm enough to eat outdoors? This lazy summertime attitude doesn’t contribute much to workplace morale or productivity. Because of this, you’ll shine especially bright if you continue to show up on time, work hard, and smile just like it was an average week in October. (And when the temperature’s creeping into the triple digits, the air-conditioned office is a great place to beat the heat.) This is also an excellent time to cozy on up to the boss: show your initiative, make some killer proposals, and finish up that project a week or two before it’s due. Utilize the last hour of the day to with the contacts you’ve recently met. Send them a personalized message with a tip, compliment, link or article that they might enjoy. A personal touch goes a long way. And the best news about daylight savings?  You will eventually get out of the office and still play a game of softball before the sun goes down."},{"post_categories":["Featured","LinkedIn for Small Business"],"author":"Ryan Roslansky","title":"Sharing Professional Content on LinkedIn and Twitter","date":"June 29, 2012","content":"LinkedIn and Twitter have worked together since 2009 to enable the sharing of professional conversations on both platforms. Since this relationship began, some of you chose to sync your LinkedIn and Twitter accounts to share your professional content, knowledge and expertise.

Today's new professionals aren't just searching job sites and emailing resumes; instead, “social” is their native habitat. They use social and professional networks to research companies, explore trends, and get the inside scoop on careers from classmates, friends and family. So in this dramatically changed environment, which companies have attracted the attention of today’s students and recent grads? To find out, we crunched LinkedIn data. Our results are based on their LinkedIn activity including job search behavior, the companies they follow, and their views of company pages and member profiles. As expected, the big multinationals top the global list: What about companies that are beyond the global giants? When we looked at Top 10 lists for mid-sized companies (1000 - 10,000 employees) across different countries, some interesting trends emerged: A recent survey** shows that more than 35% of students plan to use LinkedIn as a primary source for their job search – that’s a 700% increase since 2010.  And our numbers back this up: students and recent graduates are the fastest growing demographic on LinkedIn, with more than 20 million* today from nearly 20,000 schools worldwide. Since “social” is the new “tech-savvy,” companies that build strong employment brands in the social streams where students swim will excel at attracting the next generation of top talent.  So how can companies build their talent brand to attract, recruit and retain the new generation of top performers?

My brother-in‐law and I jumped on 2 motocross dirt bikes, as we always like to do, for a spin around the private drive. When heading back toward the party, the new road tires hit some gravel and I lost control of the back end of the bike. By the time I regained control, I was no longer in line with the road, and instead hit an old rusty guardrail head on.  After spending several weeks in the hospital undergoing numerous surgical procedures it was later determined that my leg would need to be amputated above the knee. As a new reality set in, we quickly had to learn what life would now be like as an amputee. My family had recruiting backgrounds, a drive to understand it all, and just wouldn’t quit so we quickly gained momentum toward a goal to get me back to my life.  This is when we found and met .  A foundation that shares our newly discovered common passion of supporting people who’ve suffered limb loss.  WiggleYourToes supported us in getting back up quickly, and now my wife and I give back to others by being on the board and starting the first WiggleYourToes chapter on the East Coast. When I returned to work 6 months after the accident, I saw my career in a different light and had an opportunity to make yet another major change.  The doors of LinkedIn opened at the perfect time.  I was craving new energy, and landed in the thriving, dynamic and unique culture of LinkedIn which immediately commanded my entrepreneurial spirit. In fact, after just a few weeks on the job, my Director challenged me to run in the JP Morgan Chase 5K Corporate Challenge in New York’s Central Park and of course I readily accepted. After committing to the challenge, time flew by while I learned a new industry, a new company and culture and pushing to gain momentum toward my goals.  When the 5K challenge got closer, I knew I had not trained nearly as much as I should have and was nervous, anxious and scared because I didn’t know what to expect during/after the race mentally or physically.  A couple weeks leading up to the event, the LinkedIn NYC team designed a t-shirt to compete in the JP Morgan Chase T-Shirt contest to win a $1,000 donation for WiggleYourToes Foundation.  The team was tenacious about winning, and that’s exactly what we did. I was honored to see them fight so hard to take home a victory that earned us much needed funds to help others. When the race day arrived last week, I was totally stressed out but held most of it in my own head.  I had tremendous support from my fellow colleagues and friends who wanted to stick with me at whatever pace I could do and be with me to cross the finish line.  An anxious moment indeed as 15,000 people crept toward the starting point. But once the race was underway, I felt confident and comfortable as my team was by my side.  When I needed to walk, they walked; when I needed water, they jetted to the tables to get me a cup; when I fell, they quickly picked me up and kept urging me forward.  Now, I know this wasn’t a marathon run, but I can assure you that it was a proud moment to cross that finish line with the LinkedIn team, leading me right into the arms of my family just a year after this tragic accident. I cannot thank my family, friends, and colleagues enough for their support and encouragement."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Life"],"author":"MaryAnne Viegelmann","title":"InDay: Play and Bring Your Kids to Work Day","date":"June 21, 2012","content":"At LinkedIn, our passionate employees work hard everyday, so for last Friday’s InDay we asked employees around the world to “play”.

However, the  in the series highlighted a different type of scalable online learning -- one where are interpreting new data, receiving feedback, and constantly improving. Our speakers were  and  , world-renowned computer science professors at Stanford and machine learning superstars. They recently launched , which is partnering with Princeton, Stanford, the University of Michigan, and the University of Pennsylvania to offer free online courses to everyone. Their mission is inspiring, as are the technological challenges they are solving in order to accomplish it. As computer scientists, our ambition is to achieve scalability through technology. Until recently, however, education has resisted this widespread trend towards greater efficiency. College tuition costs have been rising twice as quickly as healthcare costs -- and four times more quickly than the Consumer Price Index (CPI). And yet education is essential to filling the widening  : in the United States, we have the highest number of job openings in nearly four years, while 22 million people are unemployed or underemployed. Coursera brings technology (and scale) to education. Over a million students have signed up, and some courses reach tens of thousands --  numbers unimaginable in a traditional classroom setting. Andrew noted that it would have taken him 250 years to teach as many students as he reached with his online machine learning class. Is it possible to achieve that scale while providing the personalized instruction that studies show is best for learning? Coursera starts by using world-class instructors, then goes beyond passive video instruction by offering in-lecture interactive quizzes -- the equivalent of professors asking quick questions in class. However, in contrast to what amounts to semi-rhetorical questions in a large auditorium setting, the quizzes are in sync with every student and provide immediate feedback and recall before a student has the chance to fall behind. Coursera’s approach to feedback and assessment is a very interesting application of data science. Tests are either computer-graded or peer-graded -- the latter following industry tested crowdsourcing best practices (clear instructions, gold standards, training, qualification tasks assessor agreement monitoring etc.). Peer grading isn’t just treated as a means for scaling -- it is part of the learning process. One of Daphne’s charts showed that students significantly improved on subsequent tests after peer- and self-grading. Interestingly, the better students learned even more from self-grading than from grading others. Coursera’s scale also creates a powerful community. Students who ask questions in online forums receive answers in 20 minutes, and voting mechanisms surface top questions. Study groups meet all over the world to meet students’ particular needs -- be it language, learning style or background. Employers are also taking notice -- we are starting to see Andrew’s machine learning class on the resumes and LinkedIn profiles of people we’re trying to hire. Of course, scale also offers opportunities for data analytics. Instructors can detect patterns in students’ mistakes, common learning paths, and particularly challenging modules. They can then adapt their material based on these insights.

Launched in April with a few of our customers, Targeted Status Updates aims to make it easier for members to receive relevant information from companies they follow. In turn, companies can now communicate with their followers in a very personalized way and provide content tailored to specific audiences. So, why follow companies? We did a study recently where we found that 67% of our members follow a company to gain industry insights, 61% for company news, while 49% are attracted by the peer community. Getting company status updates will allow you to accomplish this, and now with our pool of 2 million companies it opens up endless possibilities. When following a company, you benefit from receiving engaging insights like company news, industry trends and job opportunities in your daily news feed. The more you engage with a company, the more you’ll find relevant content to help you meet your professional goals. [embed]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuDgan3s4d4[/embed] Only a small number of our existing customers have had a chance to try these Targeted Status Updates until now, and they are seeing positive results. Philips for example saw a 106% increase in engagement by followers after running Targeted Status Updates in their daily communications with members. We’ve also made it easier for company page administrators to track the effectiveness of their efforts with the release of our powerful new follower insights page. Now more than ever, company page administrators can quickly understand the demographics, growth, and engagement of their company followers.

We are continuing to investigate this situation and here is what we are pursuing as far as next steps for the compromised accounts: It is worth noting that the affected members who update their passwords and members whose passwords have not been compromised benefit from the enhanced security we just recently put in place, which includes hashing and salting of our current password databases.

We want to reiterate that we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused our members. From the moment we became aware of this issue, we have been working non-stop to investigate it. While we continue to learn more as a result of our ongoing investigation, here is what we know now: Yesterday we learned that approximately 6.5 million hashed LinkedIn passwords were posted on a hacker site. Most of the passwords on the list appear to remain hashed and hard to decode, but unfortunately a small subset of the hashed passwords was decoded and published. To the best of our knowledge, no email logins associated with the passwords have been published, nor have we received any verified reports of unauthorized access to any member’s account as a result of this event. Since we became aware of this issue, we have been taking active steps to protect our members.  Our first priority was to lock down and protect the accounts associated with the decoded passwords that we believed were at the greatest risk. We’ve invalidated those passwords and contacted those members with a message that lets them know how to reset their passwords. Going forward, as a precautionary measure, we are disabling the passwords of any other members that we believe could potentially be affected. Those members are also being contacted by LinkedIn with instructions on how to reset their passwords. We are also actively working with law enforcement, which is investigating this matter. Finally, we’ve enhanced our security measures through an additional layer of technical protection know as “salting” to better secure your information. We are working hard to protect you, but there are also steps that you can take to protect yourself, such as: Our efforts to protect LinkedIn members impacted by this incident are ongoing and we will continue to keep you posted here.

We take this criminal activity very seriously so we are working closely with the FBI as they aggressively pursue the perpetrators of this crime. As you may have heard, there have been reports of other websites that have suffered similar thefts. We want to be as transparent as possible while at the same time preserving the security of our members without jeopardizing the ongoing investigation. In this post, we want to address questions we've been receiving and share what we've learned so far about the incident, how we've responded, and what we're doing to protect our members going forward. First, it’s important to know that compromised passwords were not published with corresponding email logins. At the time they were initially published, the vast majority of those passwords remained hashed, i.e. encoded, but unfortunately a subset of the passwords was decoded. Again, we are not aware of any member information being published at any time in connection with the list of stolen passwords. The only information published was the passwords themselves. Here are the most common questions we are being asked by our members: Thus far, we have no reports of member accounts being breached as a result of the stolen passwords. Based on our investigation, all member passwords that we believe to be at risk have been disabled. As soon as we learned of the theft, we launched an investigation to confirm that the passwords were LinkedIn member passwords. Once confirmed, we immediately began to address the risk to our members, prioritized as follows: Based on our investigation, those members whom we believed were at risk, and whose decoded passwords already had been published, had their passwords quickly disabled and were sent an email by the Customer Service team. By the end of Thursday, all passwords on the published list that we believed created risk for our members, based on our investigation, had been disabled. This is true, regardless of whether or not the passwords were decoded. After we disabled the passwords, we contacted members with instructions on how to reset their passwords. We have built a world-class security team here at LinkedIn including experts such as , formerly vice president and chief information security officer at Yahoo!, who joined us in 2010. This team reports directly to LinkedIn’s senior vice president of operations, . Under this team’s leadership, one of our major initiatives was the transition from a password database system that hashed passwords, i.e. provided one layer of encoding, to a system that both hashed and salted the passwords, i.e. provided an extra layer of protection that is a widely recognized best practice within the industry. That transition was completed prior to news of the password theft breaking on Wednesday. We continue to execute on our security roadmap, and we’ll be releasing additional enhancements to better protect our members. If your password has not been disabled, based on our investigation, we do not believe your account is at risk. However, it is good practice to change your passwords on any website you log into every few months. For that reason, we have provided information to all of our members via the , as well as a banner on our homepage instructing members on how to change their passwords.

While yes, it may be best that you don’t find yourself attracted to the woman in accounting, or that you down a club soda rather than a glass of chardonnay at the company picnic, and steer clear of the water cooler conversation about the impending merger, but the reality is: she’s cute, it’s cold, and if you’re about to be down-sized, it’s better to be on the in than the out. Whether you like it or not, gossip is a part of the career landscape. While you should absolutely steer-clear of the malicious, bullying, back-stabbing, falsehood kind of word-on-the-street, there are times and places when getting and having the goods are going to be hugely advantageous to your career. From lay-offs to promotions, the truth is having your ear to the ground will help ensure you don't miss out on the goodies that may affect your career. But there is a quid pro quo expected as part of the rumor mill and if you’re not willing to participate, you’re going to be out of the loop.  The best way to ensure you are armed and ready is to have some factual and positive news to share. Follow your co-workers' as well as other companies within your industry so you can pipe in with comments like, \"Did you hear that Bob got a promotion?\"   The other trickier but very potentially powerful element of the Give to Get concept is using it to establish loyalty and allegiance.  If you hear that there is a promotion in the pipeline that may affect your boss, deciding to share that information may very well ensure that she’ll have your back come your yearly review. One of the most effective ways of leading the direction of gossip in a positive and productive direction is to be prepared. You never know when you’re going to hop on the elevator to find your boss who wants to know what you think about the latest IPO or who made a startling entrance at last night’s marketing gala. Ideally, you’ll already be up to speed and ready to take advantage of this impromptu and relationship-building tete a tete. One of the realities of this digital era is that news comes at us at a fast and furious pace, and more often than not, is delivered to us online. I have heard more than one story of an employee learning her colleague has just been laid off via her profile status or that the company is in financial distress via a newsfeed rather than from the C Suite. Check out your industry-specific newsfeed to help you prioritize and sort through the news that’s making the rounds. Out of the Office:  While I'm not particularly proud of it, The Bachelorette is on my TiVo - and it turns out it's on my boss's as well.  The purpose of gossip is often to get past the day-to-day grind of work. A little detour into the lives of the Real Housewives can be a powerful way to safely bond over the lives of others. And in some cases it can even translate into an informative workplace discussion. Mad Men regularly makes the rounds of marketing industry publications and . Frivolous and unrealistic maybe, but at the end of the long day, it’s better to be talking about Don Draper's love life than your boss's. Speaking of which, here's a little lesson for those of us on the receiving end of gossip, especially when it comes to the world of office dating. Speculation is infinitely more interesting than reality. There are three ways to stifle the gossip-mongers when it's your life and career on the block. (1) Tell the truth: I'm not recommending sharing TMI here!  Just a simple, mature acknowledgment of the relationship will do just fine. (2) Direct confrontation:  When it comes to the bad kind of gossip, the culprits are generally bullies and they tend to back off when faced with a simple \"What did you say?\" (3) Distraction:  Being the focus of gossip isn't so bad when it's about the kick-ass job you did on the client proposal. Update your profile status with lots of fun, positive and team-based congratulatory messages, and you'll be sure to get the right kind of attention."},{"post_categories":[],"author":"Jodi Glickman","title":"Find Your Next Gig: Tips for Freelancers and Contractors","date":"June 5, 2012","content":"Are you one of the who make your living as a solopreneur or independent contractor? Perhaps you’re considering taking the leap, leaving corporate America and striking out on your own (the independent workforce is projected to grow by 40% to ). If you’re a freelancer, you know how important it is to get gigs and maintain a healthy backlog of new clients and prospects. Here are three tips that will help you land that next project or assignment and keep the business coming… Make sure your LinkedIn profile is up-to-date and complete with all of your relevant skills and experiences. Think of your profile as your first stop for personal branding and marketing. Keep SEO in mind and use keywords as you update your profile. Make sure to include phrases like “freelance journalist” or “independent contractor and graphic designer” in your summary, headline and tags. You also want to be easily searchable based on your key skills and desired client base, so include those skills that drive your revenue stream or business, i.e. public speaker, corporate trainer, six-sigma consultant, etc. Think of it as marketing 101 and be sure to include your value proposition to potential clients as well — what kind of results you do you regularly achieve for clients? Go ahead and boast a bit — your bio should draw potential clients in and make people want to hire you. And of course, a picture is worth 1000 words — if you work in the visual arts, take advantage of the app. , an advertising and production freelancer, uses this app to show off his creations right alongside his profile. It’s easier than ever before to share your artistic genius with the world. For those in creative and non-creative industries—you can show your stuff with LinkedIn’s new app — upload your recent PowerPoint presentations to give others an idea of the great work you do. Get recommendations! People want to know that you’re great at what you do. I’m much more likely to hire you when I see that six other people are singing your praises and love working with you. Haven’t stock piled any? Start writing recommendations for others and in exchange, ask friends, colleagues or former clients to reciprocate. And don’t worry — it’s never too late to ask. Even if you transitioned off a team or stopped working with an organization months or even years ago, it’s okay to reach out, reconnect on LinkedIn and ask for a recommendation. If it has been a long time, consider providing some guidance on what you’d like that recommendation to say. It never hurts to help jog someone’s memory about the great work you did for him or her in the past. Most freelancers live by referrals. Your network is your most important asset. , a project manager and early childhood expert says word of mouth referrals are her best friend. She keeps in regular contact with her network and always reaches out to former clients when she’s between jobs to let people know she’s looking for work. She also sells her skills, not just her experience. “You want to demonstrate that your skill set is broad and can meet all of a clients needs,” says Halee. Freelance journalist uses her LinkedIn network to find editors to approach with story lines or pitches. She researches their backgrounds and finds mutual connections so that she can get a warm introduction via LinkedIn, which typically yields a much better response rate. But it’s not just one-on-one networking that’s important. Joining groups can be just as effective. Check out the hundreds of – there are groups for writers, graphic designers, software developers, virtual assistants—you name it.   Find your affinity group and get involved. You can join group discussions, find job postings, and make invaluable connections that will lead to new business leads down the line. At the end of the day, building and maintaining a strong freelance business boils down to building relationships, marketing yourself regularly and using your extended network to source opportunities. Stay in touch with former clients, classmates and colleagues, don’t be afraid to highlight your skills and talents and ask others to vouch for you. Opportunity is more likely to come knocking at your door when you proactively set yourself up for success."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Mobile","Privacy","Security"],"author":"Joff Redfern","title":"More about our mobile calendar feature","date":"June 6, 2012","content":"You may have seen a few press stories highlighting concerns about how your data is used in the opt-in calendar feature of our mobile phone apps.

The bad news? It’s still a really tight job market for young people, with one of every two recent grads either unemployed or underemployed. How can you be among the fortunate ones? As someone who has guided college students to careers for the past ten years, I can tell you that it takes hard work, persistence and -- perhaps most important -- the guts to step out of your comfort zone. Here are some tips on how to use LinkedIn to be a courageous post-college career seeker: While resumes are limited to one page of standard-format, bullet-pointed information, your LinkedIn profile can go way beyond the basics. The information on your resume and profile definitely need to match (job titles, employment dates, key accomplishments, etc.), but think about LinkedIn as an expanded portfolio of who you are and what you can do professionally. Include a well-written, confident summary statement both to explain what you offer to employers and to show your written communication skills. Beneath that, fill your Specialties area with keywords representing all the skills you gained during your college years. Next, don’t be shy about including all professional experience you have, even if that experience was unpaid or part-time, such as a spring break internship or after-school tutoring. If you don’t have much paid work experience, you can showcase volunteer work, school projects, internships and extra curricular activities. Add additional sections to your profile in areas where you particularly excel, such as standardized test scores, volunteer work, honors or awards, or a creative portfolio of your visual work. Finally, collect a few recommendations from professionals who are willing to publicly sing your praises, such as a professor, an internship manager or a boss from your summer job. Just remember to ask each person to vouch for you in specific and professional terms, such as “Robert demonstrated excellent attention to detail and budgeting skills as head of the student government fundraiser,” rather than “Robert is a great person and very smart.” Although it may feel weird, it’s okay to prompt your recommender with a few bullet points of what to include in his or her recommendation (once that person has agreed). And remember that you have to be connected to a person on LinkedIn to request a recommendation (see the next tip for strategies on growing your network). One of the major benefits of a university education is the vast community of alumni you join when you graduate. Don’t wait another minute to tap into this network now that you’re a part of it. Trust me as someone who graduated from college 16 years ago that I’m always thrilled to receive an email or LinkedIn request from a fellow grad of my alma mater. I love sharing some ideas or guidance in exchange for the good feeling of helping someone whose shoes I was in not that long ago. To tap into your alumni network, check out , a tool that shows you where your school’s alumni live, where they work and what they do. Just click on the city where you’d like to live or the profession you’d like to enter and a range of graduation years (you can select all years to get the broadest results or search for recent grads who may be in jobs similar to the ones you want) and you’ll discover alums who meet the criteria you’ve selected. You can also find alums by joining LinkedIn Groups for alumni of your university -- simply visit the and search by the name of your school. When you come across someone you admire, someone who’s posted an interesting discussion or someone who works at a company you’d like to join, gather up your courage and send that person a LinkedIn connection request. Keep your message short, simple and polite: “I recently graduated from ABC College and I’m hoping to start a career in the healthcare industry. I came across your LinkedIn profile and really admire your career path. Would you be willing to offer some advice or ideas on breaking into the field? I would be so grateful for a brief phone call or just a few tips by email. Thank you!” You can use the above strategy with other contacts as well by connecting on LinkedIn to friends, neighbors, family members, former professors and advisors and other professionals. Upload your address book to LinkedIn and start reaching out. Even people who’ve know you your whole life will view you differently when they interact with you in the professional context of LinkedIn. When I ask students if they comment on employers’ LinkedIn status updates or respond to recruiters’ group discussion posts, they often say, “No. I don’t want to say something that will hurt my chances of getting hired.” While of course you need to be careful what you say (never criticize the company or share too much personal information), it’s a mistake not to engage with companies that clearly want to engage with you. After all, that’s why they’re using social media in the first place! First, follow every potential employer by visiting its . When you see that employer update its status with company news, an article or an event announcement, leave a brief, thoughtful comment. Then, when you apply for a position, you will have a track record of interest and engagement with that employer. It’s like showing up at job fairs and company information sessions on campus -- you want to become a familiar face online as well as offline.

But recently, I had the opportunity to visit LinkedIn’s headquarters in Silicon Valley and take a peek behind the screen, as it were, in order to write . Going into it, I imagined LinkedIn would be one of those scrappy tech startups you hear about all the time. And while there’s plenty of playful energy at LinkedIn, I was struck by how grown-up the operation is. LinkedIn is housed in a campus located just down the road from Google, the sort of serious-minded operation you’d expect from a publicly-traded company that happens to be the world’s largest professional online network with more than 160 million members. There’s a real sense of excitement at LinkedIn that’s palpable as you walk the halls and talk to people. LinkedIn is growing at a rate of about two new members every second, and keeping up with that kind of hyper-growth serves as its own kind of energy drink. At LinkedIn’s offices, there’s a hum of energy that comes from workers who feel as though they’re on a mission. And maybe they’re right – after all, LinkedIn isn’t another tech company hawking the latest shiny gadget that you’ll need to upgrade in a year. It’s helping members achieve things that are deeply important to them – discovering insights to be better at what they do, finding a new job, attracting more clients or building a stronger professional network. As a LinkedIn user, I’ve found LinkedIn Groups to be an especially good way to expand professional contacts beyond the usual suspects and to generate new ideas. I was also interested in what , LinkedIn’s CEO, told me about the company’s mantra, which he’s been able to reduce to two words: NEXT PLAY. It’s a concept inspired by Duke University basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski, who shouts that phrase every time the ball changes hands. The idea is to make sure people don’t spend too much time celebrating a successful outcome or lamenting a poor one. Instead, they turn their attention to the next play, the challenge ahead. “Next play” has become a rallying cry for LinkedIn, a reminder that for all of the company’s success, there’s still more work to be done.

One of the key design principles that drove the approach for the visual change was to simplify the experience; creating an elegant, delightful and customized experience for news consumption. One of the core focus areas for LinkedIn Today has been to design a user interface that is engaging and simple to use. The default magazine theme layout creates a nice page hierarchy that allows users to quickly scan and identify the most interesting and relevant news and content. It also gives users an overview of who’s sharing articles in your network – a great way to find like-minded people. Users can use the “Share” and “Save” buttons to share in their network in a timely fashion and save articles for reading later. You'll also notice that we've made changes across the product experience to offer further customization of news so that members can receive the most timely and relevant news impacting their peers and industry. You'll see this when you click on the “Customize your news” tab on the right hand module, as well as when you click on the gear setting icon on the upper right corner of the page. Those links will lead you to the news setting page where you can easily follow more industries & sources, as well as change the news email settings. We know that having access to realtime information and insights can be just the competitive edge you need to deliver a productive meeting as well as help you be empowered for your workday. And we're thrilled that we're able to keep coming to you with new ways to make it even easier to be more productive and successful.

Talent is a company’s most important asset, so we decided to use LinkedIn’s data insights to discover which startups are grabbing the attention of San Francisco Bay Area engineers. In the Bay Area alone, there are more than 240,000 professionals on LinkedIn in engineering and related roles. They use LinkedIn to establish their professional profiles, build their networks and get the insights they need to be great at their jobs. They also use LinkedIn to learn more about companies of interest and their employees. This includes visiting profiles of employees looking for common connections, checking out LinkedIn Company Pages, and following companies using the LinkedIn Company Follow button to keep up to speed with relevant news and career opportunities. By focusing on companies with fewer than 500 employees on LinkedIn, and activity among Bay Area engineers between January and March, we can surface insights into which startups are attracting the interest of this scarce talent resource. Three major takeaways stand out for which startups Bay Area engineers find most appealing: . LinkedIn knows how valuable big data is and our own big data powers this blog post. And it seems Bay Area engineers are looking to embrace similar opportunities, propelling big data companies to four of the top ten spots (Cloudera, Palantir, Hortonworks, & Splunk). . Our top 2 tech startups, Arista Networks (hardware) and Nicira (virtualization software), are taking different approaches to transforming networking, but are both red hot with Bay Area engineers. . Box, Square, and Pinterest are well-known brands beyond the engineering community, blending strong consumer awareness with a growing employer brand. Ever changing. Silicon Valley moves at record pace, and since March already both Yammer and Instagram (being acquired by Facebook) have made impressive strides with engineers, so we’ll be keeping an eye on which new companies vie for a place on the leaderboard. Stay tuned as we continue to mine our data and dig up more nuggets to help better understand how companies beyond Silicon Valley can attract different pools of talent. If you’re interested in tackling some really big data, and think you can build brilliant products to connect talent with opportunity on a massive scale, ."},{"post_categories":["Featured","Infographic"],"author":"Nicole Williams","title":"Does your To Do List need a makeover?","date":"May 22, 2012","content":"If you’re like the majority of people around the globe, a day in your life consists of a never ending to-do list that doesn’t always get completed. According to LinkedIn’s latest study, professionals around the world use a pretty even mix of paper and technology to capture their daily tasks. We are also easily distracted and, especially if we work in law, chances are we’re not likely to knock off the majority of things on our to-do list. At the end of the day, not all to-do lists are created equal and the quality of your list is tied to your success. So, does your to-do list need a makeover? Find out how here (right after the infographic): Unless you’re craving the pleasure of the ‘scratch-off’ that comes with completing a task, it’s not likely you’re listing tasks like bathroom break, call mom, shop Gilt, and chat with Jenna in accounting, but the fact of the matter is there’s a lot of our day that we spend dilly dallying. Most of us need a little down time over the course of the day to take a breath and stretch our legs, but it’s worth finding out if you’re spending an inordinate amount of time on unproductive tasks.  One of my favorite ways of shocking people is to ask them for one week to make a record of all the time they spend on on-work essentials. 10 hours, 20 calls and 15 to-die-for-sales later, it puts the reality of your to-do list in perspective.   You can have non-productive time in your schedule each day, but just be sure to add it to the list. It will quickly become clear why you didn’t get to that report. Having spent some time on a farm in my youth, it didn’t entirely surprise me to learn that LinkedIn found professionals working in agriculture claim to be most productive: 83 percent stated that they regularly fulfill most of all of their planned tasks. The regularity of routine (due to sunlight, seasons and the fact that if you don’t feed the pig, the grass, the chickens… well, they die) is real motivation to get your to-do’s done and something those of us outside of agriculture can learn from. With 26 percent of the professionals stating that they are easily distracted, having a regular list of tasks that need to get done each and every day will help not only keep you focused but also ensure you’re able to respond to inevitable diversions of your attention.  For example, if your boss walks by your office and asks what you thought of the latest industry news, you’ve already read and can thoughtfully respond; or if someone in your industry backs out of a speaking gig and you happened to connect with the organizer last week, he may end up asking you to come to the rescue. Starting your day with a list of efficiency to-do’s, including: being up to speed on industry news, contributing to discussions and reaching out to key contacts on LinkedIn, is the key to getting the things on (and off) your list done! You don’t need to be an expert to-do-er to know the trap of the dregs. These are the things that you find on your list again… and again… and again because they are either hard, non-essential or are things that frankly, you just don’t want to do. This is the part of our list that literally and figuratively hold us back from the satisfaction and motivation that come from a clean slate. Write down your dreg list and divide it into the three categories. For the ‘hard’ pile, go to and ask questions. Don’t be afraid to ask for help and ask for insight. You don’t need to do it alone, and hard problems are most often solved through group-think – or rather, by someone who’s also endured the same ‘hard’ problem and knows how to solve it. The non-essential pile should be reviewed by a trusted colleague (this list more often than not really should be in ‘hard’ or ‘don’t want to do.’) If in fact, these are non-essential tasks, so take them off. The ‘don’t want to do pile’ is my favorite. The key to this list is delegation.   Do an to find someone to take on the task. Whether it ends up being a willing intern or new vendor, your to-do list just got shorter!"},{"post_categories":["International","LinkedIn Tips"],"author":"William Arruda","title":"9 minutes a day: Continuous career management","date":"May 14, 2012","content":"I have been working with LinkedIn since early 2012, exploring the importance of continuous career management. Along this journey we have found that spending just 9 minutes a day on your career management could help you get promoted, find that ideal job or help you become better at what you’re already doing. I’ve analyzed what realistically can be fitted into a daily schedule without adding stress or pressure. It is commonly known by educators and psychologists that the ability to focus one's attention on a task is crucial for the achievement of one's goals and so I believe that 9 minutes is the maximum time that can be spent concentrating on one subject before minds begin to wander. [embed]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBkSwobbac[/embed] We all know the pace of change in employment is accelerating and for this reason, is more essential than ever. Rapid changes in the working world have seen steadily decreased opportunities for job tenure, increased fluidity in the job market and have drastically altered the types of jobs that are available. Graduating from University with a degree is no longer guaranteed to land you a great job or successful career and so regardless of your level or situation; you need to ensure you’re consistently managing your career to put yourself ahead of the game. 9 minutes a day is a short window of time which can easily be slotted into your busy day – by making your 9 minutes a continuous habit and part of your daily routine, there will be no added stress or pressure to your existing schedule or ‘To Do’ list. 9 minutes gives you complete focus – a time away to focus on you – to reflect on your current career status and more importantly, your career aspirations. Here are some suggested activities you can easily slot into your 9 minute window and LinkedIn clearly provides a perfect platform to facilitate a wide number of these: These days, everyone is busy and time poor and so it’s easy to get distracted and lose focus on your 9 minute ritual.  To avoid this set a specific time of day for your 9 minutes of continuous career management. This could be during your lunch break, whilst commuting using the Linkedin App on your mobile device or whilst enjoying your morning coffee. Try to prioritise your actions for the 9 minutes so you are truly focused – build a calendar each month with your 9 minute actions to help keep you on track.

For similar posts check out our series on networking tips and tricks . – Ed. I’m guilty of this myself. When the summer months approach and I have more work than I can handle, I consider hiring an intern. I know there are students out there looking for an opportunity to build their skills, but instead of just putting out the call, I end up oscillating somewhere between: I could use the support, but sometimes it feels like it's more work to train them than to do it myself - and on top of it all, I’m not sure I’m going to have a full-time job for them at the end of the internship. In reality, taking on interns does require investing your time and energy, but it will pay off in the end.  Here are some easy steps to help you take advantage of them so that they can take advantage of by getting the skills they need to land a job… even if it’s not with you in the end! This may very well be your intern's first “real” job experience (not including bussing tables and working the school newspaper.) They'll most likely feel shy, a bit out of place, and somewhat intimidated. They don’t want to make a mistake, and they don’t want to talk out of turn. So, how do you break the ice? Take the time to actually get to know your intern. Kick-start the process by checking out their interests on LinkedIn. Learn about where they went to school, their hobbies and past experiences. Creating a rapport with them will open up the lines of communication and make them feel more at ease, which in turn will make them more skillful workers. If they don’t have a thorough profile, give them pointers on why it’s so important and how to use this internship to continue to build it out so at the end of the term they are walking away with a solid, employee-enticing profile. Use yours as an example by highlighting your word choice, skills, and specialties. Then, make sure they were paying attention by giving them some LinkedIn-related homework: personally connecting with 50 contacts and completely updating their profile. If your intern is a college graduate looking for a full time gig at your office and you don’t have one, then have the talk - no matter how much you might want to avoid it. Let them know there aren’t any full time jobs available for them at the moment but ensure they know this news is not permission to slack. If you don’t have a job for them don’t feel guilty about it but make sure they are walking away tangible skills and real-world work experience that will land them a full-time gig. I’d also encourage them to use this time to prove that there is a job here and they are the one to fill it. If you give your intern (legitimate) hope of earning a full time position, then they’ll work harder. Here's another task to give to your intern that'll help you know if they have what it takes and support their full-time working venture: instruct them to follow competitive companies on LinkedIn. This is essential research for you and it will also help them keep an eye out for a full time opportunity. : Now that you’ve had the ‘get to know you’ and ‘expectation’ conversations with your intern, it’s time to get down to business. Think about all the tasks that you could put on their desk that’s been cluttering yours. Be very specific about what you’d like them to do.  Once they’ve mastered those tasks, research what types of skills and specialties they list on their profile that could come in handy at your firm. Are they proficient at HTML? Can they work Photoshop? Manage your social media groups? Put those skills to use and let them spearhead a project. But make sure you let them know when they’re doing a great job. Getting positive feedback will give them the confidence to work hard at any task - and win even more of your approval. But remember, since it’s your intern’s first introduction to an office atmosphere, they may be extra inquisitive, which could halt your own work flow. Combat this issue before it starts by introducing your intern to LinkedIn Groups and Question & Answers. By doing so, you’re letting them know that it’s OK to ask for help from other industry professionals - something that's especially useful when you can't devote all the time that's necessary for answering their questions. The worst thing an employer can do is keep an internship going with no end (ie: pay) in sight. If they really have done a stellar job for you, have learned everything they can in the context of this opportunity but you just don’t have the resources to hire them, then flat out let them know. Encourage them to seek a new gig that pays. Write them a stand out recommendation, highlighting all the great projects they’ve worked on and how much they've helped the company's bottom line. Reach out to your network to see which of your contacts might be a good fit for them.  Sit down with them and give them a tutorial on how to effectively network and search for jobs on LinkedIn - a tool that they'll need to master no matter what job they end up taking."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Tips"],"author":"Jodi Glickman","title":"How to Make A Career Switch","date":"May 10, 2012","content":"Conventional wisdom says that an average worker has between 7 and 10 careers in a lifetime.  For the Millennial generation, that number is even higher.  Today’s workforce is mobile, global, and tech savvy.   With opportunities literally at our fingertips, it’s easier (and more acceptable) than ever to try one’s hand in a new field.  If you’ve been thinking about a career change, here are 8 tips to get started: First, ask yourself three key questions: Are you bored or not challenged?  Itching to be part of the start-up, high tech revolution?  Do you need to move to a more lucrative field?  Whether you’re looking for more job satisfaction, a bigger paycheck, a more collaborative work environment, or a chance to put your natural talents and skills to use, you’ve got to know what’s driving you and then tailor your job search to meet your needs.    When Suzanne, a close friend, reached her limit as a corporate accountant, she was determined to put her interpersonal skills to use.  As she began to look for new jobs, she focused on organizations and roles that would emphasize and value her communication and leadership skills above all else, and thankfully ended up at a non-profit that did just that. Do you need to go back to school to get there? Does it require an advanced degree (Ph.D., MBA, MFA, etc.)?  Are internships or apprenticeships a pre-requisite? If you’re headed to media or entertainment, you likely need to start in the mailroom or as a production assistant.  If journalism is your thing, blogging and/or freelancing are great ways to start.   Finance will likely require an advanced degree while high fashion is all about scoring the right internship.  A great way to learn about what the pathway to success looks like in your desired field is to network within and search for 2nd and 3rd degree connections to ask for informational interviews. Chances are you’ve acquired some marketable, transferrable skills along the way.  What do you do well? Coding, graphic design, project management, creative writing?  We’ve all got natural talents and abilities—think about how to put yours to use in your desired field.  What skills will help you mange relationships with teammates, clients, customers or your boss and help you become a great sales rep, councilwoman or entrepreneur? What skills are most valued and how do your natural talents jive with what’s needed to excel in your new field?   Look at the profiles of people who have the positions you want and check out their —do yours match up? Next, get organized Follow industry trends on and sign up for Smart Brief newsletters to get smart about what you need to know in real estate, aerospace or advertising.  If you have specific companies you’re interested in, follow them on and set up for up-to-date news on key transactions or key players in the business.  Join or follow your industry’s key professional associations (and if you don’t know which ones to join, check out ).  You’ll need to be able to speak with confidence and insight about your new industry so that people take you seriously and want to help you pave your way into their field. A career transition can take anywhere from months to years.  Create a plan with near and long-term goals and strategies to map out your course of action.  I recently spoke with , a former investment banker who dreamed of opening up her own cooking school for kids.  She longed to start her own business and become an entrepreneur, but the thought of leaving the corporate world (and a steady paycheck) behind was terrifying.   Jessi decided to take baby steps.  She enrolled in an for women entrepreneurs to bounce around ideas and then reached out to former classmates and friends for brainstorming and fundraising advice.  She scoured her network to find legal advice for small business owners and secure her first location.   She gave herself a timeline of 18 months to get her ducks in a row before leaving her corporate gig.  Today, she is up and running with a staff of thirteen at Kitchen, a state-of-the art test kitchen for kids. Update your LinkedIn profile to indicate your interest in your desired field. Make sure your Opportunity Preferences are set to welcome career opportunities.    Tell everyone you know—family, friends and acquaintances—that you’re transitioning into a new field so they can help your cause.  And make sure you’ve got your ready in your back pocket so that you can easily explain your professional journey to others – where you’re heading and why, where you’ve been, and how the two are connected (i.e. why this career move makes perfect sense). Work your network Explore and expand your network.  Reconnect with classmates using LinkedIn Alumni.  Ask friends, classmates, or former colleagues about job openings in your desired field.  Do an filtered by industry.  Can your connections share expertise, introduce you to others or sit down with you for informational interviews?  Ask key questions about how people broke into the field—what helped them become successful and what skills do they think are most valuable to new professionals in their industry today. Finally, stay on top of industry trends, news and events so that you’ve got a great reason to reach out to potential employers, friends or colleagues in your new industry.   Congratulate others on job moves or promotions, offer to help someone breaking into the field you’re leaving, and do your best to reciprocate for help you receive in your own career switch. Reaching out is a two-way street—the more you do for others, the more you’ll receive in terms of help moving forward on your own career path."},{"post_categories":["Economic Graph"],"author":"Mario Sundar","title":"The Next Human Leap: Closing the Gap Between Talent and Opportunity","date":"May 10, 2012","content":"A few months ago, our CEO Jeff Weiner wrote in Fortune Magazine describing the “other” unemployment crisis;  that despite historically high unemployment rates we still have more than three million unfilled job opportunities in our country, and what we could do to solve it. Last week, he had a chance to revisit this theme in his speech to roughly 1,000 local CEOs and business leaders at the , where the theme was \"The Next Human Leap\". Jeff’s speech touched upon the ever widening gap between in nearly four years and the roughly 22 million unemployed and underemployed individuals in the US. i.e. the gap between the job opportunities currently available in the U.S. and the skills required to fill those jobs. Simply put, he argues the pace of innovation has accelerated to the point where it's becoming increasingly difficult to properly educate our existing workforce to capture newly created opportunities and he recommends a three part solution: 1. Improve our education system -- both longer term, generational improvements in primary school education as well as immediate term improvements in vocational training 2. Free up the supply of H1B visas to make it easier for those born outside of the U.S. with unique skills and qualifications to work inside the U.S. 3. Invest in our digital infrastructure and new digital technologies Solving for the widening gap between talent and opportunity is of great importance to us at LinkedIn, as our vision is to create economic opportunity for every professional.

For similar posts check out our series on networking tips and tricks . – Ed. Say again? So I struggle for months to find an internship. Research, wear a suit, interview, interview and interview again until finally I convince a company to take a chance on me. And now I work over 60 hours a week in a completely new and challenging environment, trying things I’ve never done before with people I’ve never met before. Grabbing coffee, researching until my eyes roll back in my head, becoming the go-to for anything tech-related just because I know how to register a URL, basically at my “boss’s” beck and call… and all this, I do for ? I’ve heard this lament about internships more times than I care to count - but let me assure you, the biggest mistake you can make is to think (and even worse, act) as if you’re working for free. In fact, if you’re making the most out of your internship, you’re going to be walking away with one of the most lucrative opportunities of your career. Here are the three things you want to get out of an internship that will make it all worth it. You’ve heard the good ol' saying, \"It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.”  Well, believe it.  Career opportunity almost always comes through people and if you want to land a job outside of this internship, it’s all about making quality connections… lots and lots of them (at least 50!) After creating a thorough LinkedIn profile where you highlight your education, volunteer and work experiences and keep track of your newly acquired skills, you want to take a two pronged approach to building your Rolodex. Your initial focus is to ask for connections from all the folks you work with, and if you have a particularly close working relationship with your manager, ask if she is willing to help you make introductions to her connections. Think: \"(Insert boss’s name here) admires the work you do and suggested I reach out to connect with you.\" Then, you want to spread your wings. Start following companies you may be interested in working with in the future.   Study who's in and who’s out, and if you find someone of interest with whom you have something in common ( ), feel free to ask exploratory questions like \"How did you get into the industry?\", building up to a suggestion to further your conversation over a coffee. You have two very unique and unthreatening things going for you: first, you have a “job” while you have an internship and second, you’re new and people want to help people who are starting out.  But keep in mind this very important qualifier: even as a newbie, no one owes you anything.  When you are asking for a connection, it’s always helpful to go in first with a compliment that illustrates the fact that you’ve done your research.  But save your big asks (i.e., a job) for after you’ve built some rapport or even better, have offered something to help them (like registering that URL you’re so good at). One of the biggest mistakes I see in internships is the whole sit-back-and-wait-to-be-told/shown-what-to-do approach.  An internship is all about what you make of it and it’s important to keep in mind that your boss is two things: very busy and somewhat afraid that you’re going to screw up. At the end of the day, you are new to the whole scene and there is going to be some reservation about putting you on the front line. It’s up to you to prove that you are up to the task. Three initiative taking tricks:  1) Take a look at the mission-critical skills that others in your industry or organization have acquired and follow their lead; 2) Go onto LinkedIn Groups and join the conversation. Ask for insight and advice before delving into a tough project or participating in a meeting to demonstrate your knowledge; and 3) Try actually executing the project on small scale. Internships are exactly where you want to try your hand at new things, not only to build your skill set but also to get a real sense of whether or not this is the career for you. The whole point of an internship is to move from theory to practice, and the more initiative you take and confidence you instill, the more earning power you’ll muster. Relationships + Experiences = Recommendations.  Let’s go back to the opening lament about internships. Yes, there is a risk that you will be working for nothing - and by nothing, I mean failing to build the relationships and experiences you need to walk away and have someone be willing to endorse you and your work. The key here is to start with the end in mind. Even though it’s not until toward the end of the internship that you’ll be making the ask, you need to work hard and be worthy of a recommendation from the start. Build specific skill sets that they can refer to in a recommendation. Also, figure out whose word has the power to influence the opinion of those who are hiring - both within the organization and the industry at large. Help them to get to know you and your skills long before you need to ask for the recommendation to post on LinkedIn and make it easy on them by specifying what you would like it to highlight. A recommendation is worth its weight in gold. Don’t leave an internship without it!"},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Lindsey Pollak","title":"Lurk First (and Four More Tips on Beginners Getting the Most out of LinkedIn Groups)","date":"April 23, 2012","content":"Interested in finding a new job, switching careers, attracting more clients or building a stronger professional network? LinkedIn Groups is the place to be. Groups provides opportunities to meet and engage in discussions with members of your industry, your alumni community or other professional interest areas. Becoming active in LinkedIn Groups is like attending a professional conference every time you log on. To join a group, start exploring the Group Search page, which has recently been updated to make it easier for you to find the most valuable places to network. Then click “Join” for any groups that sound appealing. Once you’re accepted as a member, you’ll be able to post and comment on discussions, review job postings, connect with your fellow members and more. With over over a million groups on LinkedIn, you’re bound to find several communities that are beneficial to you and your career. But with so many opportunities to participate, what’s the best plan of action? Here are five ways to get the most out of LinkedIn Groups. The first groups to join are those you belong to offline. For instance, become a member of your university’s LinkedIn alumni group, any corporations where you’ve worked, any professional or trade associations you belong to and any non-profits where you volunteer. Because you share a “real world” affinity with your fellow members, these are the environments where you’ll likely feel most comfortable seeking advice, connections or information. You might post a general career question, such as “Does anyone have advice on making the transition from consultant to full-time employee?” Or, you might search each group’s members for people in your desired industry to whom you can reach out and request an informational interview. Next, join groups related to your industry (or the industry you want to join if you’re a recent grad or career changer). You’ll stay up to date on important industry issues, must-read articles and other hot topics. To find the most valuable industry groups to join, be as specific as possible in your search criteria. For example, type in “social media marketing” rather than simply “marketing” if that’s your particular interest area. If your search comes back with lots of results, LinkedIn helps you filter by showing you which groups are “Very Active” (definitely where you want to be for the most potential opportunities) and which groups include members of your network (if people you admire belong to a particular group, that’s a great sign that you’ll find value there as well). Join as many industry groups as feel relevant to your interests -- you can always drop out if the discussions aren’t valuable for you. In any group, your best bet is to “lurk” first without commenting to get the lay of the land. Check out what topics receive the most comments. Look to the “Top Influencers This Week” area to see which members are driving conversation. Visit the “Manager’s Choice” discussions, where the group’s manager has elevated certain conversations that he or she feels are most important for members to view. You can also get a feel for the overall tone of each group’s discussions (Casual or buttoned-up? Highly technical? Globally or regionally focused?) before you contribute. After lurking for a little while, dive in! Discussions are a fantastic place to be visible and highlight your skills and expertise to a broad audience. You can answer a question, add your opinion to a discussion, share advice with someone seeking help, comment on a posted article or all of the above. To make sure your contributions are having a real impact, craft them as if you were speaking on a public panel or writing a letter to the editor of a news outlet. If your comments are relevant and helpful, people will take notice by commenting back and / or “liking” what you say. Some fellow group members may even offer more than that. Recruiters and headhunters love to scan group discussions to discover talent, as do journalists seeking expert sources and conference planners seeking presenters. In addition to engaging publicly in groups, you can also use group discussions to build or enhance one-on-one relationships. Let’s say you’re scanning discussions in an industry group and you come across a comment that’s strongly related to your interests or expertise. In addition to -- or instead of -- posting a comment publicly, you can take the opportunity to reach out directly to the person who posted the discussion. You can do this by clicking on “Reply privately” next to the person’s comment and writing a message such as, “Dear Greg, Thanks for sharing your question about how to find a social media marketing job in the Denver area. I’m looking for a similar role, but in the Boston area. Perhaps we can chat sometime and compare notes?” To continue the live conference analogy, think of this strategy as having a side conversation while attending a large networking event. Your goal is not to directly ask for a job or client, but to network in a mutually beneficial way with someone who shares similar professional interests. Finally, what can you do in a group if you don’t see any immediate opportunity to comment on a discussion, answer a question or reach out privately? Simply make it your goal to add value every time you visit each group (which should be a few times a week at least). You can add value by “liking” an interesting discussion, voting in a poll or perhaps forwarding a posted job or article to someone in your network. LinkedIn Groups are about building community, and in any community, every action counts. This is just a starting point but we’d love to hear from you if you’ve tried some unique ways to participate on LinkedIn Groups.

Last August, we completely revamped our iPhone, Android and Mobile Web products. Today, we added the newest member to our mobile family – LinkedIn for iPad. The new experience re-imagines LinkedIn for the iPad, taking full advantage of Multi-touch and the new Retina display. We aspire to be the place where every professional comes throughout the day. A place where members come to gather important business intelligence and insights to be great at what they do. With that, I’d like to introduce you to our new app: ...  The Linkedin iPad app was handcrafted to provide the most engaging experience for our iPad users by shining a spotlight on the essential information they need throughout the day. We know that our members use their iPads heavily during the morning and evening hours.This “Coffee & Couch” behavior is so pronounced that we designed our new app to make every professional feel like they have their own personal assistant. Imagine having one place where you can get all the info you need about who you’re meeting with that day, trending and timely news that is impacting your industry, who’s changed jobs and what your coworkers are sharing, liking, and commenting on. We’ve pulled all this for you, all in one place. Professionals live by their smartphones and iPads to manage their day. In particular, they constantly turn to their calendar to see when, where and who they are meeting. To help you understand “who” you are meeting with, the LinkedIn iPad app can sync with your device calendar to incorporate rich Linkedin profile data about each attendee. With the LinkedIn iPad app you are one tap away from learning about things you have in common with the people you are about to meet, like common connections, work experiences, and schools; probably helps to know what they look like as well. Now you’ll have something more important to talk about than the weather (of course, if you need a weather update, we’ve included that in the app as well). We like our calendar feature so much we decided to also include it with our LinkedIn iPhone (iOS 5+ required) and Android apps. It’s there now, so check it out. Your professional dashboard also contains all of the features you’ve come to enjoy on our mobile products - updates, news, groups, who’s viewed my profile, your LinkedIn profile, search, Inbox and much more. Besides the all-ubiquitous search box to help you find professionals on LinkedIn, our iPad app is broken down into three main areas: : Get a snapshot of your professional updates, news, and information all in one place : Access your profile, connections and activity dashboard with a quick swipe : Send and receive your LinkedIn invitations and messages in one place You can also find us on the web. In addition to our iPad app, we are rolling out a new mobile web experience for the Safari browser on iPad. Try it here: tablet.linkedin.com. Today, our new iPad app is available in English. The mobile team is working hard to bring localized experiences to you and we are always looking into new ways to enhance our mobile experience - wherever our members work. Lot’s more to come.

Of the , four were about the purchase. But on a much more personal level, the social network also made news. This time, though, it was COO Sheryl Sandberg's admission that she leaves work at 5:30 p.m., has been doing so since she had her first child, and is no longer ashamed to admit it.  ( ) For years, says Sandberg, she used to cover her bases by sending emails late at night or early in the morning so that coworkers would realize she was working very, very hard — despite not being at her desk. I did that when I was at Google, I did that here, and I would say it's not until the last year, two years that I'm brave enough to talk about it publicly. Now I certainly wouldn't lie, but I wasn't running around giving speeches on it. But now she's definitely talking about it. And the result has been almost a global exhale. Wrote UK-based program manager in a LinkedIn update: Our office is hugely guilty of this. Actually told myself post Christmas I'd try to leave before 7:30 more often. In India, a HR manager named sent a LinkedIn update in response with just one word \"Commendable.\" The Sandberg story comes on the heels of , which saw an article about the uselessness of working more than 40 hours rocket to near the top of the charts.

I'm not just referring to salary requests here, but negotiations about flexible work arrangements, parental leave plans, part-time work schedules — even deciding work assignments we accept. Here are a handful of my favorite negotiating tips for strengthening your confidence and impact at work: More companies than you may realize are willing to make case by case determinations about money, roles, or career paths. In fact, there's less of a trend today requiring that all employees conform to one strict hierarchy or ladder. And yet, over the years I've observed many professionals skip negotiating altogether, seeing their work conditions or earnings like an item in a shop that has a non-negotiable, fixed price on it. But what might surprise you about the very best negotiators is that they don't need slick moves or mind tricks to get their needs met. Instead, they see the world around them as open to revision and up for discussion and they tend to set their sights high. It's up to each of us to do the same; doing our homework before making the \"ask\" and building a compelling case that's hard to say \"no\" to. After all, we don't get what we don't ask for!

With all of the research tools available on the Internet and elsewhere, it is now easier than ever to avoid this mistake. You should always visit a potential employer's own website first. Then, for additional information and up-to-the-minute insight, proceed directly to LinkedIn Company Pages. A is a centralized location to learn about a company's operations, current news, products and services, employees, job opportunities and more. There are over two million company pages on LinkedIn, spanning a vast number of industries, company sizes and geographic locations. Where does all of the information on a Company Page come from? The organization itself provides a portion -- the company overview, Careers page and Products and Services descriptions. The rest of a Page's information, including the company statistics and employee information, are based on LinkedIn's own network data. This means that on a Company Page you're getting more information about the backgrounds and career paths of the people who work for that organization. As a potential job seeker, this information provides a guide on what it takes to get hired and succeed at that particular company. For instance, you can learn what universities a company's employees attended (including who graduated from your own alma mater), what types of employees are receiving promotions and what LinkedIn groups those employees belong to. As you'll see below, all of this information can help you better craft your LinkedIn profile to attract the attention of recruiters for that company and it can help you find potential referrals into that organization. To make the most of Company Pages as a job seeker, begin your research on the page and follow these easy steps: First, search for every company on your prospect list. Begin to stay up-to-date on job opportunities, company news and industry trends. All company status updates will appear on your LinkedIn homepage, so you'll never miss a new opportunity. You can find additional prospects by using the search facets on the left side of the Search Companies page. You can search for companies based on location, industry, size, whether they are currently hiring (over 22,300 are hiring on LinkedIn right now!) and how you are connected to that organization. I love this last search option most of all. You can filter a set of results to include only those companies that are hiring AND those where you have 1st or 2nd degree connections. It's always easier to get a job at an organization where you have support from an existing employee or where a friend can make a personal referral. How do you turn those 1st and 2nd degree connections into opportunities? The best approach is to reach out to request informational interviews from people who work for the companies where you'd like a job. (You can do this directly with your 1st degree connections or through an introduction request for 2nd degree connections.) Write a brief note that says something like this: \"I'm very interested in a potential opportunity at XYZ Company and saw that you currently work there. Would you be willing to chat with me for 15 minutes or so and share your experience at the organization? I would be so grateful for your time.\" Most people, particularly if they know you personally or are introduced to you through a trusted contact, will be happy to answer a few questions or share some advice. The trick is to impress them when you're on that informational call. So, before you speak to anyone for an informational interview, spend at least 30 minutes on that organization's Company Page to learn about its products, services and current news. The Overview tab of the Page will provide a summary of the company, its recent status updates (the news that company wants its LinkedIn followers to know) and available job opportunities. (The Overview also provides additional insight into how you are connected to employees at the company through your LinkedIn network and university alumni network, which is great for finding even more people to ask for informational interviews.) Many companies also have \"Careers\" tabs on their LinkedIn page, where they share more information about working for their organization, such as videos, employee testimonials, awards and recognitions. Review this information thoroughly so you can ask very specific questions during your informational interviews. For instance, \"I read about your company's new environmental initiative -- can you tell me more about how that is working?\" is a much more impressive question than, \"So, what does your company do?\" The more you impress your connection, the more likely he or she is to recommend you for an open job. In addition to helping you prepare for informational interviews (and real job interviews later on), Company Pages can also help you improve your LinkedIn profile so that a recruiter is more likely to notice it. Click on the \"Check out insightful statistics\" link on a Company Page to find helpful intelligence about what an organization looks for in its employees. For example, you can learn what job functions and educational degrees are most common, and you can view the 10 most common skills listed by employees at that company (which are great keywords to include in your own profile, as long as they're accurate). And, you can view the LinkedIn profiles of people at that company with new titles -- which includes people who've just been hired or just been promoted. This means you can study the profiles of the exact people who succeed at that organization. Take note of how they describe themselves in their profile headlines and summary statements, what experience they list, what groups they belong to and what their recommendations say about them. These are all tips for what to include on your own profile to attract the attention of recruiters from that organization. Don't be shy about reaching out to a company based on what you've learned from its Company Page, even if you don't have any 1st or 2nd degree connections. You can comment on a company's status update in a way that shows you are interested in their news and educated about industry developments. For instance, you can respond to an update about a company's new product by mentioning that you recently read a positive review of it. Or, if you see on a Company Page that a person has recently been promoted who is in your or shares a LinkedIn Group with you, reach out and say congratulations. You can use the opportunity to politely mention that you are interested in working for that organization as well. Finally, there's one more area of a Company Page you shouldn't miss. On the \"Check out insightful statistics\" page, you'll find a listing of where that company's employees worked joining that company and where employees worked that company. These are great organizations to check out as potential employers as well. Remember that you need to cast a wide net in your job search and research as many prospects as possible."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News"],"author":"Daniel Roth","title":"LinkedIn's Top Stories: Han Solo vs. Vito Corleone -- Who is the Better Leader?","date":"April 6, 2012","content":"Here's an idea for a new game: Would You Rather, The Business Edition.

But moving cross-country and looking for a job at the same time — it's enough to throw any sane person over the edge. Launching a job search in a new city is undoubtedly harder than finding a new gig in your hometown, but today you've got more resources to help make the transition smooth, seamless and successful. Here are 8 things to keep in mind as you load up your VW, board that plane, or head for the other coast. Ask yourself the tough (or obvious) questions and be straight with yourself. Are you making a lifestyle choice, (Boulder anyone?) moving to be close to friends and family, or making a career change? Any of these factors will likely impact your job prospects and earning power post-move. Whatever the case, be honest with yourself about the reality of the situation and adjust your expectations accordingly. Start reading the local papers online and find some niche blogs that speak to you. Research the business drivers in your new city — is your destination a high tech zone, like Silicon Valley; a booming college-town like Austin, Texas or a burgeoning start-up community like Chicago? How robust is the local economy? Are you moving to Bismark, ND ( ) or Detroit ( )? Take into account the strength of the local economy as you factor in how long your job search will actually take. Update your LinkedIn profile with your headline \" Post your new status on Google+, Twitter, Facebook  and any other social networking sites you use.

For the more adventurous who want to take networking offline, consider joining an in-person MeetUp group. The Portland Job Seekers Group, for example, hosts regular networking and recruiting events around town. Once you've tapped into your network, old and new, go ahead and take the plunge — ask for the help you need. People relish being the expert on their city and enjoy helping friends and acquaintances find their footing in a new locale. Ask your friends, friends of friends, friends' parents who they know who can help your cause. Be as specific as possible in your requests for help. Do you want contacts in and or are you looking for informational interviews with consumer products professionals in Cincinnati?

Instead, make your job search work for you by using the advanced search function in and searching jobs by keyword, zip code, date posted and more, so that you are only seeing the most relevant and interesting jobs. You'll also have the ability to see who you're connected to at respective employers, giving you a great leg up to learn more about a specific company or position.

Job search in coffee shops so that you're not home alone feeling blue. Get a part-time job or volunteer to get to know people and become engaged in your new community. Whatever you're hoping to accomplish, assume it will take longer than expected. Finally, reach out and thank all of those who helped you along the way. Close the loop and let people know how things turned out. And of course, think about how you can return the favor and pay it forward. Who can you help with a job search or write a LinkedIn recommendation for? How can you give back to your new (or old) community?

Like any other social presence, understanding what you want to accomplish takes precedence. What do you want to achieve? Are there \"fan\" groups already in place that you should participate in? Or perhaps it's as simple as avoiding the risk of becoming a \"ghost town\" once you start? Search Engine Land's group is designed as a networking group, to be a place where people interested in search marketing can ask each other questions and get help. We actively encourage discussions, and strongly discourage self-promotion. The focus is clear, and as a result, the members benefit. Below are eight tips that have fostered our group, and built a community that is nearly 40,000 members strong. Search Engine Land is an active group that is closely monitored, so we developed rules for our group in order to maintain the discussion quality. For example, we clearly state in our group rules that we hold a firm line against people posting links since many are either self-promotional or just outright spam.  If a member posts links from outside sources, we delete them from the queue. Unfortunately many posts don't add value, and risk burying the good conversations that do take place. We invite everyone to join, but we do hold all of our discussions to be moderated. As a publisher it seems counter intuitive to not have your news feed on. It’s natural to want to get the content out to where the people are.  But then again, if you publish a lot of content each day, you may be tempted to share the entire feed on your social channels like your LinkedIn Group. That’s not necessary. Don't bury the interesting posts shared by individuals - the group is not about you. If you want to promote dialogue and sharing, feed content is not the way to do it. Sometimes member link posts are legit, they just don't belong in a discussion. For example a free webinar on a relevant topic, or, of course, a hot job listing both provide value to the group. By enabling these categories, you keep the discussions clear of promotional content. We publish timely tech news as well as more in-depth how-to's, so we have an advantage to seed our discussions differently each time. Whether if it's results from a recent internet marketing study, or a new feature that Google has rolled out, we like to point to our content as a reference. Asking questions and taking polls are easy entry points. Recommending to bookmark a source or sharing a guide is also a valuable way to make the most of the evergreen content you have on your site. Special editions, \"best of\" rankings, and seasonal content are all excellent fodder for any LinkedIn group. We are in a unique B2B space, with many questions specifically about website marketing or search marketing. The expertise within the group spans from extremely high level marketing professionals to more technical developers, with many providing resources as well as consultation. To handle the broad range of content, we recently asked one of our active group members to be an admin - he answers many of the technical questions even helping guide some of the newer internet marketers in the right direction. Pro Tip for Members: In the Members area, check out your Top Influencers, you can get a good sense of who is contributing to the most active discussions in your group. The Manager's Choice area in the group allows you to highlight an article or discussion - not just in the Group interface, but also in the regular email sent out to group participants. This is a great space to call attention to a timely topic that may be getting a lot of activity, or announce a special event. If you have an interesting discussion going, spread the word. As publishers we naturally cross-promote on channels like Twitter and Facebook to drive traffic to our sites. The audience from those networks are usually already in place, as a result they provide a platform to easily grow your LinkedIn group participation. Recently we had a contributor looking for some volunteer websites to take part in an article he was writing for us. We had a call for volunteers on LinkedIn, and promoted the opportunity on our other social channels. Within days he had over 70 requests on LinkedIn, many more than needed, but it demonstrated that there was a need to be filled  - people were actively looking for help. We continued to promote the same thread outside of LinkedIn again, only this time mentioning that there were businesses looking for search expertise. We used the LinkedIn group as the starting point for the article, but continued to promote the discussion outside of LinkedIn to keep it going and aggregating responses. Although not directly related to LinkedIn Groups, one of the most beneficial things you can do as a publisher is to take part in LinkedIn Today. Although a stand alone website, it powers articles to also appear on your own personal LinkedIn home page. Because it matches content to people within specific industries, it can .

Would have made a great blog post. But then I realized that I had worked well beyond 40 hours this week and the chances of the output being any good were dangerously low. This is something managers of the Mad Men era once knew, but the link between long-hours and lost-productivity has been lost in the information age. First, the list:  Inc.'s brief look at the 40-hour workweek — based largely — reveals a couple of interesting facts: One, that in the 1960s, even the Chamber of Commerce was a fan of 40-hour weeks and, two, that a raft of studies done at the time proved that companies got no additional output from a 10-hour day than an 8-hour day. Writes the author of the original piece: By the eighth hour of the day, people's best work is usually already behind them (typically turned in between hours 2 and 6). In Hour 9, as fatigue sets in, they're only going to deliver a fraction of their usual capacity. In the decades following the Great Depression, researchers had studied what contributed to great work, and when that work fell off. All of the research showed that there was a benefit to closing the factory doors or bringing in new shifts. With the New Deal, the U.S. made a 40-hour week a national standard. But, of course, the meaning of work changed with the tech revolution. Suddenly there were fewer workers at lathes and more coding, constructing PowerPoints, or filling out tax forms. Did the hourly findings hold for them, too? Salon says, yes: Research shows that knowledge workers actually have fewer good hours in a day than manual laborers do, on average, about six hours, as opposed to eight. You can stay longer if your boss asks; but after six hours, all he's really got left is a butt in a chair. Your brain has already clocked out and gone home. One thing the article gets wrong, however, is the idea that there's such a thing as keeping a butt in a chair. As Henry Blodget points out in his highly shared presentation, , the chance of any of us disconnecting from the office even when we're not in the office are getting lower and lower. The global smartphone conversion — the U.S. is about , while the rest of the world is a bit behind — means no one is ever truly disconnected. And that makes keeping to even 10 hours more difficult. Might be interesting, actually, to diagram out the growth in hours worked vs. the growth in smartphones. But that's just going to have to wait for next week."},{"post_categories":["Engineering"],"author":"Mitul Tiwari","title":"Spread of Social Networking in Emerging Economies","date":"March 21, 2012","content":". One of our stellar interns from last summer, from the University of Michigan, explored how users from emerging economies are interacting with social networking. He did so by analyzing LinkedIn's unique data set with over 150+ million members, representing professionals from every country in the world, including several million in Africa and a strong presence in Asia and Latin America. We recently published this large-scale data analysis in a paper [1] at the (ICTD 2012) and I'm happy to present the results here: As mobile and Internet penetration improve worldwide, users from developing countries are participating in increasing numbers in online communities. Several studies of web usage patterns in developing country contexts indicate Internet users in these areas are very engaged in online social networking and communication tools, spending a significant portion of their online time on them. These observations have been made across several usage scenarios, ranging from educational institutions in urban India to remote Internet access sites in Africa and Latin America. The paper we presented at ICTD 2012 provided the first large scale and detailed analysis of social networking usage in developing country contexts. Our analysis was based on profile and activity data from LinkedIn members. As part of the work, we analyzed data in understanding social networking usage in the developing world under six themes: In this blog post, I'll give you a preview of the paper by presenting the analysis for the first theme, \"Connections\". For the rest of the themes check out the . Online social networks enable participants to establish connections with members from around the world. Here we investigate the makeup of these connections. For connections that do not terminate in the same geographic region, we consider patterns in cross-country and cross-continental relationships. The following figure shows a branching map that depicts where outbound connections terminate for selected countries. For each country, we show a few countries where members in the originating country have connections to. The thickness of the line for each arrow corresponds with the fractions of connections that terminate in the destination country. An interesting pattern in analyzing social network connections is the interconnectedness of members within a region, or the locality of relationships. We express the geographic locality of relationships by computing the ratio of connections that are established to members within the same geographic region. The following figure shows the interconnectedness of various regions. For each region represented, we also provide a few selected countries from the same region, and consider connection locality at the country level. Africa and the Middle East have two of the lowest rates of geographic locality: nearly 40% of connections in each respective region are established with members outside the region. Next we analyzed geographic locality of connections for all countries in Europe and Africa. In the following figure we show connection locality by dots, as the dots on the map of each country get larger and darker, connection locality increases. Another interesting way of looking at connection distributions is to consider how far connected members are from each other. Using location information, we estimate the distance between members using the . The following two figures show connection distance for different regions and a selection of countries.  In the above two figures, for each region, the distance distribution is computed by considering all connections that originate from the region. On average, Africa and Asia have the two longest distances for connections, and this is also reflected in the individual countries represented. Several reasons, including geographic attributes of the region and the rate of connection locality, affect this distribution. The goal of this analysis is to provide a revealing look on the growth, adoption, and characteristics of social networking in developing countries. Read for more details on the rest of the themes.

Hand Over Your Passwords","date":"March 23, 2012","content":"You may think you're prepared for every question that could come up in a job interview. But here's a new one: \"what's your Facebook password?\" In one of the most widely shared stories on LinkedIn this week, the Associated Press reports that companies are getting aggressive about peeking at your social networking profiles. Many job hunters have tightened their Facebook privacy settings so that the details of their personal lives don't jeopardize a potential job. But some employers are trying tactics to bypass those obstacles, including asking potential new hires to log in at the job interview, or \"friend\" human resources managers to get around those settings. The legality of asking job candidates for their passwords has been challenged, and some interviewees have walked out on opportunities rather than work for a company that would employ the practice. But with unemployment still high at 8.3 percent, many people need a job so badly they can't afford to stand on principle. But maybe employers should be more concerned about making their new hires — and their top achievers — happy. There was lots of buzz on LinkedIn this week around a story by Forbes contributor Erika Anderson on why companies lose their top talent. Anderson says it comes down to being badly managed, and organizational structures that are \"confusing and uninspiring. Writes Anderson: Be clear about what you're trying to accomplish as an organization, not only in terms of financial goals, but in a more three-dimensional way. What's your purpose; what do you aspire to bring to the world? What kind of a culture do you want to create in order to do that? And then, once you've clarified your hoped-for future, consistently focus on keeping that vision top of mind and working together to achieve it. It's advice that applies to keeping not just to top talent, but entry-level workers. Nobody wants to work in an environment where people are clamoring to leave and providing an inspiring culture can often be a better incentive to stay than a fat paycheck."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Brad Mauney","title":"An Easier Way to Grow your Professional Network","date":"March 27, 2012","content":"Today, we're excited to announce an update to our feature that will be rolling out to users over the next few weeks.

In December 2011 Heyning and a team of hackers created a hack aimed at helping LinkedIn members achieve their career aspirations. Inspired by this work, the team suggested the theme Aspire for an inDay and Hackday. The goal for this inDay would be to challenge all LinkedIn employees to clearly define their own aspirations and take a step toward them, encourage everyone to look at how they can inspire those around them to chase their dreams and entice our engineers into looking at how the LinkedIn site can assist our members with their career plans. Along the lines of inspiring others, a group of us invited 130 8th graders from a local school to our office in Mountain View for a day of learning about what \"career\" means and what \"jobs\" you can have at a corporate company. Eight departments at LinkedIn set up workshops focused either on introducing students to skills needed for that particular function (Finance, Sales, Blogging, IT) or on giving the students tools to think about and plan their future (Recruiting, Marketing, User Experience Design and our inVersity team). The most impactful for them, and they might not know it yet, may have been their time with the inVersity team which focuses on helping college students manage their careers before they even start so they have the advantage of a professional network upon graduation. Activities in the other workshops included experiencing telesales by pitching a product to LinkedIn employees as far away as London, learning how to make a good first impression with a firm handshake and eye contact, and creating collages in a Marketing workshop on personal branding. They crisscrossed the LinkedIn campus to visit our Localization team, hear more about Hackdays, and see what \"work\" is like at LinkedIn. \"I could never imagine getting this many employees at my company to participate in such an event said one parent chaperone as he watched the students build pin boards showcasing their dreams for their futures with the inVersity team.

We are cognizant that professionals deal with an increasing number of virtual calls these days — whether via online meetings or email — so we built a single, elegant platform that tracks, measures and analyzes every aspect of both the meeting itself and the follow-up process. This not only enables our customers to identify the specific approach and tactics of their most successful salespeople, but they can also replicate them across the organization. Starting today, you can identify key decision-makers and connect with other LinkedIn members directly on a SalesCrunch online meeting. Simply put, integrating with LinkedIn makes meetings more social, enabling participants to quickly put a face to a name and make a personal connection. Once authenticated, SalesCrunch displays relevant information from LinkedIn including common connections you have, professional history, college or university attended, and other LinkedIn members \"you may know\" at another participant's organization. Presenters and participants can now establish new LinkedIn connections with their associates, prospects, suppliers, and business partners with the click of a button during a meeting. When a meeting concludes, all authenticated users are given the option to once again invite other participants to connect on LinkedIn. This makes it especially easy for salespeople to stay close with their customers and prospects, and clients to stay connected to their associates, suppliers and business partners long after the meeting ends. With many organizations continuing to slash travel budgets, online meetings are an attractive solution for salespeople hosting frequent meetings. We are seeing the trend of companies doing business virtually and with our new LinkedIn integration, we're excited about helping people make personal connections in ways never before possible."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News"],"author":"Daniel Roth","title":"The Top 5 Stories on LinkedIn: The Leadership Lessons of CEO James T. Kirk","date":"March 9, 2012","content":"I get it: It's tough and lonely being a leader. You can't always ask people around you for answers — you're supposed to them, not seek them! — so sometimes you're forced to grab inspiration wherever you can. And this week, the professional world picked two sources: an Inc. roundup of great leadership qualities. And lessons from Captain James T. Kirk. From Star Trek. Here's the full list:  You've got to hand it to Forbes' Alex Knapp for finding ways to connect the Enterprise with modern enterprise. For instance, leaders should never stop learning, which can be seen in Kirk's ability to build a shotgun to defeat a group of \" \" called Gorn. If you think about it, there's no need for a 23 Century Starship Captain to know how to mix and prepare gunpowder if the occasion called for it. After all, Starfleet officers fight with phasers and photon torpedoes. To them, gunpowder is obsolete. But the same drive for knowledge that drove Kirk to the stars also caused him to learn that bit of information, and it paid off several years later. In the same way, no matter what your organization does, it helps to never stop learning. Knapp goes on to find lessons in Kirk's knowledge of poker and willingness to place himself in harm's way. He praises Kirk's willingness to blow up his baby, the starship he commanded. And he issues a interplanetary call to arms: \"By following these lessons, we can lead our organizations into places where none have gone before.\" Over at Inc., writer Jeff Haden follows up last week's most popular story — — with a shorter list from across the great cubicle divide.

Turns out LinkedIn likes this question, too. In a recent survey, we were able to poll professionals from across the globe and looks like we have a winner! The country where professionals feel luckiest is... Nearly half of all LinkedIn members feel lucky in their careers - and it's because of a few globally accepted tricks for increasing your luck factor, ranging from being flexible to having a strong network. Want to be luckier in your career?  Hint number one: get on LinkedIn. Hint number two: Follow these three tips. Somewhat surprising (considering the serendipitous nature of luck) is that one of the top 5 most universally identified important contributor to getting lucky in your career is this: not sitting back waiting for it to happen, but to get out there and work for it. But don’t be deterred thinking, \"I’m already logging 70 hours a week!\"  Work ethic has so much more to do with working smart rather than working hard, and as far as I’m concerned the smartest thing you can do is to use the resources that help do the work for you.   Get this: if you put in the work to thoroughly fill out your professional profile, like adding more than one position and your volunteer work experience, then you’ve just made yourself 12 times more likely to be viewed – and that can happen when you’re working on your business plan, out for dinner with friends or even in your sleep.  That’s what I’d call working your luck. Actually, come to think of it, you can be shy because LinkedIn provides you with the forum for hitting the second most important factor in building your career luck: strong communication skills.   For those of you who still aren’t comfortable hitting the networking circuit or asking the guy standing in front of you at Starbucks what he does for a living, LinkedIn is for you.  This is a professional platform where people expect and want to be engaged with for professional purposes, and there are a number of tools that make reaching out and communicating super easy and stress free (no make-up, breath mints or Xanax necessary).   Whether you're sending a note of congratulations to a fellow alumni after learning via your status update feed that he just landed a promotion, or forwarding an interesting article on LinkedIn Today with a note to your boss about how you think the concept presented can improve the work you do, LinkedIn gives you all the conversation starters you need to get lucky. As a native Canadian, I pull this Wayne Gretzky classic out of my career pocket on a regular basis.  “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take”.   In the spirit of this hockey great, and rounding out the list of the top 3 important factors in building success in your career, luck comes to those who act on opportunities.  If you are not on LinkedIn you are missing out on one of the most important shots at luck you have access to in your career. Increasingly more employers are using Advanced People Search to track down the talent they are after by looking for a combination of industry, experience, function and geography.  Or what about the fact that LinkedIn offers over 1 million Groups where you have the opportunity to engage with other professionals from the ease of your computer.    These are lucky opportunities you can’t afford to miss. . #inluck"},{"post_categories":["Featured","Jobs"],"author":"Manu Sharma","title":"I to the We – What is the true reach of your LinkedIn Network?","date":"March 14, 2012","content":"Some of you may have read from our co-founder, , on his book “The Startup of You” (co-authored with ). In the book, we’re introduced to a couple of interesting concepts on professional networking. One of these is the idea of “I ” – how the strength of your network out to the third degree magnifies your individual capabilities. It’s not only “who you know”, but also “who the people in your network know”. That’s the power of “I to the We” of your network. Based on sampled data, the average LinkedIn member has access to over 9,000 people via their 2nd degree network. That represents, on average, access to opportunities and connections in over 6,000 companies and organizations in 130 industries via 2nd degree connections that can be reached by an introduction. We see this clearly when we look at how a professional’s network evolves as they connect with highly connected individuals. For instance, our CEO’s ( ) first connection was our co-founder ( ). That original connection gave Jeff immediate access to 560 companies and 106 industries. We’ve also found that our most connected members on average have access to 200,000 companies through 3 million people in their extended network. The data shows that as your professional network grows, so do your career opportunities. Whether it is a former colleague, a business partner, a friend or a classmate, the connections in your network are all insiders at an organization with whom you may collaborate in the future. We actually found that as members advanced in their careers, more than 20% of them advanced to organizations where they knew somebody in their prior jobs. And this percentage only increases as the number of connections in your network grows. Adding trusted connections to your network is likely to increase your success whether it’s starting a business, finding key insights in your role, or even being more successful in a meeting. For example, our data shows that job seekers who grew their networks were 30% more likely to find jobs than other job seekers whose networks remained static. Your LinkedIn connections give you access not only to the information and opportunities in industries, organizations, and groups that they belong to, but also to their entire professional networks. That could be thousands or even millions of people your connections can put you in touch with. How long did it take to make the first 10 connections in your network? How about the first 100 or 1000? How long would it take to reach a million connections? And, that’s how a professional network like LinkedIn can give you access to a million professionals through your 2nd and 3rd degrees, even when you have only 100 connections."},{"post_categories":[],"author":"Lindsey Pollak","title":"LinkedIn Tips for Over-50 Job Seekers","date":"March 16, 2012","content":"While conducting a recent for job seekers, I was struck by the number of questions we received on the subject of job hunting over the age of 50. Fear not, Baby Boomers. There are many ways LinkedIn can be particularly useful for job seekers with extensive resumes. Here are some tips: While those who've been in the workforce for many years have built up many valuable skills, you need to make sure those skills are still in demand. If they're not, you may have to update your proficiencies. , vice president of Encore.org, an organization that helps people transition to jobs in the nonprofit and public sectors, says, \"Are your skills up to snuff for the kinds of positions you're interested in? If not, spend the time and invest in yourself. In today's environment, you could easily be working another twenty years so it's a worthwhile investment that you can amortize over time.\" If you're not sure how relevant your skills are, check out the skill requirements listed in the LinkedIn job postings for the positions you want. You can also search for and view the profiles of LinkedIn members who have those exact positions to see what skills those people mention on their profiles. If you have certifications or licenses that you know are in demand, feature these prominently on your profile. Make sure you use current terminology in describing your skills as well. To give a well-known example, \"secretarial skills\" has been replaced by \"administrative assistance.\" Find out what the dated terms are in your line of work and find their contemporary counterparts. If you're concerned that employers may perceive you as overqualified for the jobs you want, you can draw attention away from a long work history on your LinkedIn profile. You can do this by choosing to list only the last 15 to 20 years of your work experience and / or not including the year you graduated from college. Use your Headline and Summary statement -- often the first elements of a profile that people read -- to display your passion for your work or your excitement about recent developments in your industry. No matter what job or industry you're hoping to enter, technology will most likely be part of the job. Fortunately, you can use your LinkedIn profile to show potential employers that you are comfortable with current technology. (Simply by having a LinkedIn profile you're already demonstrating a level of savvy about social media!) When it comes to being tech savvy, remember that this phrase also refers to the way technology has sped up the pace of business. Respond quickly to any LinkedIn connection requests or messages you receive to show that you can operate on \"Internet time.\" Many high-level jobs are found through personal connections rather than job postings, so networking is absolutely essential for highly experienced job seekers. Just remember to network beyond your peer group and form connections with people of all generations and experience levels. One great way to do this is through involvement with your university's alumni community. Whether you graduated last year, last decade or last century, you'll always share a bond with people who attended your alma mater. Check out , where you can quickly search your entire alumni community by employer, industry and geographic location. Then, reach out to alums of every age who work in your field and ask to have a quick chat about your career interests. Most people will be happy to speak with you and may know of opportunities at their organizations. And, with your level of wisdom and experience, you'll surely be able to offer them valuable knowledge or connections in return.

At arguably the two biggest companies in their industries, an employee walked out the door lighting a torch behind him. First up was James Whittaker, a former engineering director from Google (here's ) who took to his new employer's blogging site — Microsoft — to detail the corrosion in culture he saw at Google. A few days later, a Goldman Sachs vice president used a slightly bigger platform — the New York Times — to explain the same thing. Even more amazing: his op-ed served as a resignation letter. They say two makes a trend. If so, are we in for a riot of Why I Quit testimonials? There are reasons to think so.  Perhaps the biggest sign that points to a wave of \"Dear CEO John\" letters is that, in a social age, the idea of keeping quiet seems practically archaic. Two is that if you are looking for a big audience, there doesn't appear to be a bigger way to get one. The Goldman story was the top-shared story of the week in the industries you'd expect: financial services and banking, for example,. But it crossed over into the wider professional world, too. Here are a few other industries where it was No. 1: broadcast media, computer games, software, consumer goods, defense and space, environmental services,food and beverage, government administration and there's still the rest of the alphabet worth of industries to plow through. But what about the argument that your chances of getting another job are limited; that it's not just the bridge that gets burned, but everything around you? The fact that Whittacker is still at Microsoft is one sign that that belief might be fading. And the New York media world is waiting on the Goldman quitter, Greg Smith, to sign a six- or seven-figure book deal.

If you're a woman in engineering (student, intern, enthusiast or professional), here's your chance to showcase your talents. Since today is International Women's Day, I'd like to share a little bit about my passion as a woman in engineering. Throughout my student life and career as an engineer, I've loved participating in programming contests. There's nothing like the rush of cracking a difficult problem, but over time programming contests started feeling rigid and I realized I was more interested in producing creative solutions to meaningful problems and not just code. This is when I discovered hackdays and fell head over heels for them. A hack is a quick and dirty solution to a real world problem, usually built within 24 - 48 hours. It's never perfect or complete, but it's almost always clever and insightful. At LinkedIn we have Hackdays once a month, where all employees are free to work on any idea they are passionate about. Everyone gets together to demo their hacks in front of the entire company and senior tech leaders vote on the ideas and pick winners. Some of the products you see on LinkedIn and were born as hacks. I love hackdays because what happens there is amazing. Strong personal bonds are created, you discover your physical and mental limits and experience absolute synergy with your team and others in the room. Everything starts with a seed of an idea, maybe something that fulfills a personal need or something huge that can shake up an entire industry. You do some quick research to make sure it hasn't been done already and put together a team, which means you have to go out and sell your idea to prospective teammates. We've setup a DevelopHer Hackday LinkedIn Group to help you discuss ideas and find teammates . Once you have a team, the coding starts and continues all night until you have a solution to demo. On this special Women's Day, we want to share our love of hackdays with women in engineering and are very excited to announce LinkedIn's first Women's Hackday, DevelopHer. What will make this Women's Hackday extra special?

First, technology advancements were disrupting companies and changing entire industries. Second, globalization — which is partly a function of technology — was making the world of work for professionals more competitive. These changes are redefining how individual professionals survive and thrive in the modern economy. One part of my thesis when cofounding LinkedIn was that, in response to these changes, individuals in every industry need to think of themselves as the CEOs of their own careers. People should invest in themselves as businesses-of-one, especially if they are employees at a company. We built LinkedIn to be the platform on which you could manage your professional life in this way. We kept it simple at the beginning.

But being CEO of your career means more than this. In the years since starting the company, we have extended the LinkedIn platform: We're helping you on your industry, you need to master, make the right connections, and ultimately become better at the job you already have. As I observed people learning LinkedIn, I came to realize that building the technology platform was not enough. People needed to understand more deeply the ideas and strategies that are behind the new world of work, otherwise they couldn't deploy the LinkedIn platform the right way. They needed to understand why and how to grow their \"soft assets,\" adapt, and play for great opportunities. This is one reason why I co-authored a new book called , along with co-author and entrepreneur . In the book, Ben and I focus on entrepreneurial techniques that can accelerate your career, like establishing competitive differentiation, ABZ planning frameworks, and taking intelligent risk. We look at what start-up entrepreneurs do when growing companies and apply them to a career setting — the start-up of you. We dedicated one of the eight chapters to professional relationships and explained how your network underpins all elements of career strategy. At the end of each chapter, we offer some ways to invest in yourself, including some LinkedIn-specific tips. We see the book as the foundation for an ongoing conversation. We've also for you to share your ideas and experiences and connect with others who are similarly committed to taking control of their future. May you adapt to the future, invest in yourself, and transform your career. Life in \"permanent beta\" —a term we describe in the book — demands nothing less!"},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News"],"author":"Daniel Roth","title":"Top 5 Stories of the Week: The Myth of the 8-Hour Sleep and Other Bad Business Beliefs","date":"March 2, 2012","content":"It was a myth-busting week on LinkedIn. In article after article, top authors took widely held business beliefs and crushed them. Thought your best employees were the ones who fit their job descriptions? .  Believe that you need 8 hours of sleep? .  Insist that happiness will come when you hit your sales goals? . Here's the full list:  Let's start with the BBC's sleep story. Not surprisingly, this piece was most widely shared by people in sleep-deprived industries like IT, computer software, design and higher education. For anyone who has spent their days pounding Red Bull while lamenting the poor sleep they got last night, the BBC brings sweet relief: Until the late 17 Century, the idea that you needed one long snooze was laughable. Instead, people used to sleep a few hours around dusk, wake up, write or smoke (or both), then sleep again. Candle lighting, however, started to mess with our sleep cycles. Lit streets meant people could stay out later with less fear of getting robbed and lit coffee houses gave people a place to go. Humanity pivoted and the two-sleep system was dead. Today, most people seem to have adapted quite well to the eight-hour sleep, but [sleep historian] Ekirch believes many sleeping problems may have roots in the human body's natural preference for segmented sleep as well as the ubiquity of artificial light. Now, of course, we're lucky to get even one of those sleep chunks in. Eight hours may be unrealistic, but with so much work to take care of (not to mention Facebooking, Wording with Friends, etc.) two sleeps seems even more impossible to pull off. Some of the other treasured ideas under fire this week:  Jeff Haden at Inc. looks at all the somewhat quirky,  status-quo challenging people in an office and says these are your most remarkable employees. Unusual personalities shake things up, make work more fun, and transform a plain-vanilla group into a team with flair and flavor. People who aren't afraid to be different naturally stretch boundaries and challenge the status quo, and they often come up with the best ideas. The comments on the article filled up with such \"unusual personalities\" complaining that either their peers hated them for their quirks or managers didn't hire them because they didn't fit the bill. Clearly finding and grooming remarkable employees is something that still needs some work. And also at Inc., Jessica Stillman challenges long-held beliefs about happiness, saying that success doesn't make you happy, being happy brings success. She cites a researcher at Harvard who has studied how the brain deals with happiness. The more primed you are for being happy, the better chance you'll have of achieving it. Getting there isn't that hard, either. Explains study author Shawn Achor: What we found was something as simple as writing down three things you're grateful for every day for 21 days in a row significantly increases your level of optimism and it holds for the next six months. The research is amazing. It proves we actually can change. And if you feel like taking on the world, try writing down those affirmations after your first sleep. You'll be well rested, well adjusted and just quirky enough to be the most remarkable person at your job."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Events","LinkedIn Life"],"author":"Jim Brikman","title":"LinkedIn Innovator Challenge: A Recipe for Innovation","date":"March 7, 2012","content":"Every company is hungry for innovation. At LinkedIn, we've cooked up something we call the \"Innovator Challenge,\" which has been tremendously successful at bringing out new and disruptive ideas from every employee at the company. It's a one-day event that mixes competition and recognition as a way to bring creative ideas to life. Here's the recipe: Take one day of work and every employee at your company, mix thoroughly, and let simmer for 8 hours. We've found that almost everyone is walking around with a few great ideas locked away in their head; you can help release these hidden flavors and aromas by giving everyone a full day to spend on pursuing their passions and creativity. The deliverable by the end of the day is a quick \"pitch\" (we limit it to 2 minutes) using any medium (powerpoint, video, drawing, interpretive dance) to get the idea across. Now, add in the executive staff. Getting time to work on your ideas is great; having a chance to get your work recognized and your ideas heard by the executive staff is even better. Set up a fun event with food and drink where employees can present their ideas and the executive staff act as a panel of \"judges,\" offering feedback and advice. Add spices to taste: consider inviting celebrity judges from the industry too. Finally, stir in a few prizes and incentives. We've found that , electronics, and gift cards work well to create an atmosphere of friendly competition. As a cherry on top for the winners, give them ample opportunity to show off their projects to all the relevant parties, such as a couple minutes to present their winning ideas at a product all-hands or engineering all-hands. Serving size: at this year's Innovator Challenge, we had 400 ideas submitted. We did local judging in 18 offices around the world and narrowed the field down to 18 finalists. We brought in guest judge to join CEO and co-founder to pick the winners. After an exciting round of presentations, we selected our 2012 Innovator Challenge Champions: 1st Place: & (Mountain View) 2nd Place: (Mountain View) 3rd Place: , , , & (Tokyo) Some of these ideas, including our winners, are disruptive enough that we can't talk about them until we build them. Stay tuned. We are excited to continue the Innovator Challenge tradition at LinkedIn. We hope that you can try this recipe too so you can uncover the brilliant and disruptive ideas that are sitting dormant in your office."},{"post_categories":["Economic Graph","Advance Your Career","LinkedIn API"],"author":"Scott Nicholson","title":"LinkedIn Industry Trends: Winners and Losers During the Great Recession","date":"March 8, 2012","content":"How has our economy evolved in the past five years? Which industries are shrinking or growing through these challenging economic times? These are some of the questions that the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) delves into each February in the \" \" (ERP). This year, the CEA worked with us to glean further insights into industry trends both during the recent recession and after its end in June 2009 [1]. With the data and methodology [2] in hand, we calculated the growth rates in industry size between 2007 and 2011. Here's what we found: The fastest-growing industries include renewables (+49.2%), internet (+24.6%), online publishing (+24.3%), and e-learning (+15.9%). Fastest-shrinking industries were newspapers (-28.4%), retail (-15.5%), building materials (-14.2%), and automotive (-12.8%). Instead of the growth in percentage terms, we also examined the volume of job gain / loss by industry, as indicated by the largest bubbles in the figure above. Our data show that even through the recession, the industries with the largest volume of employment growth (the largest circles on the figure above) were internet, hospitals & healthcare, health, wellness & fitness, oil & energy, IT and renewables. On the other side of the story, retail, construction, telecommunications, banking, and automotive had the largest volume of job losses between 2007 and 2011. Some of the most interesting insights came from looking at how the size of industries change as the country enters and emerges from the recession. Below is a figure depicting how industry size fluctuated by year: In terms of post-recession recovery, IT, marketing & advertising, computer software, and insurance are the largest industries that fell heading towards the end of the recession in 2009 but in 2011 are at or above their 2007 employment level. Financial services is starting its recovery and real estate appears to have bottomed out. Several industries such as newspapers, supermarkets and telecom have continued to shrink throughout the sample period. We were also able to glean the fastest-growing and fastest-shrinking job titles as the earlier today. These are fascinating and important data points that allow us to better understand the economic world, and it's just a hint of what we can see by scouring the \"data exhaust\" of 150+ million LinkedIn members who share information and insights with each other. It was exciting to be able to work with the CEA on this project, and expect to see more of this from us in the future. Helping people better understand how their skills fit into the broader economic context is something that we are well-suited to do and we would like to provide more of to our members. As our CEO, , , the ability to connect talent with opportunity is more important now than ever before. Our vision is a world where every work opportunity is digitally searchable and linked to the appropriate company and the skills required for that opportunity. These industry trends uncovered by our data science team are steps along the way to making LinkedIn's call for an \"economic graph\" a reality. ------- [1] Source: [2] We identify industry trends from 2007 through 2011 by longitudinally following anyone in the US who has a position listed in 2007 (we adopted this methodology to control for the incredible growth in our member base since people who join LinkedIn after 2007 still are likely to list a job they had in 2007).

No. 1: Managers used to be able to motivate by giving raises. (Better to motivate through clear goals and consistency, says Inc.) No. 2: Managers used to be able to set the course and expect people to follow. (Don't even try it with the social media generation, says the Harvard Business Review.) No. 3: Managers used to provide people with ... chairs. Chairs? The WSJ looks at the trend, primarily in tech companies, of mandating short, prompt meetings in which everyone stands. The goal is to keep things fast and focused. Chairs are removed from meeting spaces, as are tables or other places for people to lean. The more uncomfortable, really, the better. At one company in Florida, the person talking has to do so while holding a 10 lb. medicine ball; go on too long and your arms remind you to shut up. For newcomers unaware of the practice, \"it's pretty mean,\" [founder ] says, \"but really the main thing you want is to avoid people pontificating.\" So one thing managers can still do, apparently, is stuff that's \"pretty mean.\" But what they can't do, says Cisco VP in the HBR, is assume they can make decisions by relying on a small group of advisors. Being social is now a requirement of the connected boss. Says Hajela: \"they'll be expected to interact digitally with a much broader range of people both inside and outside the company.\" The most interesting part of Hajela's blog post is the details he pulls out of a recent research report conducted by Cisco on \" .\" Cisco's research found that 40% of those surveyed would trade a higher salary for things like the to ability to access social media while at work and the \"choice on the mobile devices they could use on the job.\" Somehow Inc., in it's incredibly popular look at what levers managers can pull to motivate workers, missed that one: cell phone choice as a perk. But it did offer up some other good tips. The biggest takeaway: Employees don't want to work for a paycheck; they want to work with and for people. A kind word, a short discussion about family, a brief check-in to see if they need anything... those individual moments are much more important than meetings or formal evaluations.

(\"Jeremy who?\") But now that he's gone from New York Knicks benchwarmer to NBA behemoth, people - even, or maybe especially, business people - want to learn from him. No surprise: His success seems to offer so many lessons for those who believe they are being overlooked or who want to believe they could have a secret star on their staff. Forbes' Eric Jackson finds 10 Lin-sights (sorry!)  in the No. 3 most-shared story by LinkedIn's 150 million members. Here's the full list:  So what managers and workers learn from Lin? There are three big take-aways: Never stop believing in what you can do (at the right place), try harder than anyone else, and learn to spot talent that might be hidden: You probably manage people at your own company today. Are you sure you don't have a Jeremy Lin living among you now? [...] We put people around us in boxes. He's from Harvard. He's Asian-American. Not sure he can play. How many assumptions have you made about talent around you? Don't be like the General Managers in Golden State and Houston, and let talent slip through your fingers. One way to identify that talent: spend time slavishly studying the numbers. That's what Ed Weiland, a FedEx driver and numbers hobbyist who writes for the website Hoops Analyst did. The who in 2010 studied two overlooked stats that pointed to greatness for the then-unknown Lin: 2-point field-goal percentage and a blended metric of rebound, steals and blocks called RSB40. Writes the WSJ's Jason Gay: Weiland concluded that Lin had to improve on his passing and leadership at the point, but argued that if he did, \"Jeremy Lin is a good enough player to start in the NBA and possibly star.\" The WSJ story didn't make our top-shared list, but it does highlight a trend that that the New York Times' Steve Lohr identifies in his No. 5 top-shared story: \"The Age of Big Data.\" In the piece, Lohr explains that looking for patterns in massive stacks of data is going to mean revolutionary changes in how business works. Research by [MIT] Professor Brynjolfsson and two other colleagues, published last year, suggests that data-guided management is spreading across corporate America and starting to pay off. They studied 179 large companies and found that those adopting \"data-driven decision making\" achieved productivity gains that were 5 percent to 6 percent higher than other factors could explain. Some of that data will turn into new ways of selling, new products to build or new markets to tackle. That promises a future filled with Lin: known but unexploited people or data just waiting to become heroes."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Tips"],"author":"Lindsey Pollak","title":"3 Ways to Reinvent Yourself on LinkedIn","date":"February 9, 2012","content":"We're already a month into 2012 and most job seekers have given up on their lofty New Year's resolutions. If you're in this boat, don't despair! Instead, use LinkedIn -- and a few trusted friends or colleagues -- to help you make the change you desire. Over the years I've observed the ways that people use LinkedIn to change career direction or perk up a slumping job search. Here are my three favorite reinvention tips: Do you belong to LinkedIn groups in 23 industries, list 41 skills on your profile and display a profile heading with 7 slash marks between each of the different descriptors of what you can do? I often come across LinkedIn users like this, who seem to believe that more is more. While I absolutely encourage you to cast a wide net in your job search and express all of your talents, you don't want to confuse people. A quick way to determine if your LinkedIn profile is too unfocused is to ask a few trusted friends to review your profile for 60 seconds each. After that minute has passed, ask each person to describe you (or the job you want) in just one sentence. If you don't like the answers you hear, then go back and revise your profile to be more clear and focused. \"But, wait,\" you might be thinking. \"I'm trying to show employers that I'm open to a wide variety of possible jobs.\" I understand the rationale, but this is a mistake. As a general rule, employers like certainty. For instance, if your LinkedIn profile says that you are interested in a job as a nonprofit fundraiser or a public relations coordinator, you'll likely be less appealing to employers in each industry than those candidates who are passionately focused on just that field. If you really can't focus on just one path, then my best advice is to try to turn your lack of focus into an asset. Using the example above, you might begin your Summary with a sentence something like this: \"I offer extensive experience as both a nonprofit fundraiser and a public relations coordinator. I am eager to serve an organization in either of these functions, and I believe that my unique combination of experience -- raising money and promoting clients to the media -- makes me more creative and resourceful in either activity.\" Most people, even the focused ones, are pretty terrible at describing themselves and promoting their unique talents. So, another great way to reinvent yourself is to reinvent the way you describe yourself. Why not ask those same trusted friends to go one step further and edit your LinkedIn profile for you? (You can show your gratitude by offering to rewrite theirs in return.) While you may not use every word your friends suggest, other people's input may help you discover a valuable new way to explain your capabilities or a strength you never realized you possess, such as resourcefulness or natural leadership ability. You'll also glean insight from what your friends leave out of their descriptions of you. Perhaps you've been promoting an unimportant credential or outdated skillset (e.g., profiles no longer need to promote knowledge of Microsoft Word or Internet Explorer) that you're better off omitting. You can also measure your profile's effectiveness and impressiveness against the LinkedIn profiles of successful people in your field. Use Advanced Search and Company Pages to review the profiles of professionals working at the organizations where you'd most like a job. While you don't want to copy sentences verbatim from other people's profiles, there's no reason you can't borrow a fabulous phrase or two. My final recommendation for reinventing yourself on LinkedIn is to change the way you interact with your LinkedIn network. The majority of job seekers log in to the site each day with the goal of something -- a piece of information, a job lead, a networking referral, etc. There is certainly nothing wrong with this, but what if you approached LinkedIn with the goal of something instead? You might give by recommending an article in your status update, congratulating someone on a success, answering a question in a LinkedIn group or thanking someone for a helpful meeting. Beyond the good feeling of helping people, being a giver will positively influence your job hunt and long-term career prospects. When people consistently encounter you as a generous person, they see you as someone who has a lot of value to provide -- to them and anyone they know who is hiring. These small daily goods also will help you stay top of mind with your network and encourage reciprocity. And, by seeing how much you have to give, you'll continually see yourself as highly valuable, too -- a confidence that will serve you well during a job search.

If you believe Mashable's headline in what is our most shared story of the week, the Stop Online Piracy Act has moved on to its final resting place. But if you read the words of the act's chief sponsor, Texas Rep. Lamar Smith, it sounds more like SOPA is just getting smelling salts in the corner. \"It is clear that we need to revisit the approach,\" says Smith. \"Congress cannot stand by and do nothing while American innovators and job creators are under attack.\" This is that SOPA news has topped the professional conversation. Last week, workers from all industries shared articles about the Internet taking on Hollywood (with Congress trying to measure the shifting winds). This week, most of the sharing was done in industries that would have been impacted by SOPA: largely, software, online, publishing, and TV and film. The rest of the working world had turned to other matters. For instance, would there be jobs for them, and if there were, would those jobs require them to live in a dormitory in China? Here's the list:  It was Seth Godin, marketing consultant and prolific author, who was the harbinger of bad news on the jobs front. \"If you're an average guy doing average work, a company is going to find someone to do the job in India for cheaper.\" Said Godin: 2012 isn't going to be more of the same, it's going to be worse. Why? Because we're not in a cyclical recession, but a \"forever recession\" caused by the end of the industrial revolution. The the only way to make good money is for workers to invent their own jobs rather than counting on finding low level or middle management positions that will pay well. Perhaps not surprisingly, the article resonated with industries that either delivered that message in form of cost-savings mandates, or had plenty of middle management positions still being filled: management consulting, banking, financial services and consumer goods. And while it didn't grab the overall top spot, a New York Times story about the factories in China that make iPhones showed the other side of Godin's barbell-shaped world: the place where unskilled jobs have migrated. They're gone for good, says BusinessInsider's Henry Blodget. Writes Blodget, : So, yes, money is part of why all of our gadgets are built in China. But what started a couple of decades ago as a reach for efficiency has now resulted in the entire electronics-manufacturing ecosystem being lifted up and transferred to China. Apple doesn't build iPhones in the United States, in other words, because there is no longer an ecosystem here to support that manufacturing. One thing for those who thinking of making the move to China, whether to set up factories or work in them, it's probably best to avoid sneaking over any fine wine. The most-shared story in the wine and spirits industry was a Decanter.com article about a Chinese exec given life in prison (life!) for not paying import duties on over 70,000 bottles of wine, possibly including Chateau Lafite and Chateau Latour His defense: The punitive tax rate of up to 50% on wine left him no choice but to smuggle."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Life"],"author":"Daniel Roth","title":"What Makes Apple Tick?

That means the news of Facebook's coming IPO -- announced Wednesday, Feb. 1 -- had only one day to attempt to rocket to the top of our rankings. A Mashable story about the IPO came close, but didn't have enough juice to unseat an infographic looking at the rise of Pinterest. That's fitting, actually, as the top two stories show how fluid the current business world is. Facebook is the giant today. But new platforms like Pinterest are popping up, rising and falling, and no business model can go long without finding itself at risk of being upended.  Here's the list:  The best example of the upending is Business Insider's look at P&G's decision to slash ad spending, realizing that it doesn't have to buy media the way it used to. In its earnings call, CEO Bob McDonald laid it out: I believe that over time, we will see the increase in the cost of advertising moderate. There are just so many different media available today ... One example is our Old Spice campaign, where we had 1.8 billion free impressions and there are many other examples I can cite from all over the world. P&G is the world's largest advertiser. When it declares a shift in thinking -- and starts talking about the benefits of \"free\" -- other large companies and any companies that depend on advertising are sure to pay attention. Then there's Pinterest, the site that's becoming a major feeder channel for retail. Members -- about 60% of whom are women -- post original pictures, photos of celebrity hairstyles, recipes, things they want to buy and more. Others comment or start their own threads based off the original post. The viral activity has caused traffic to soar, rising over 400% last fall to 7.2 million unique visitors by December. Where this curve ends is impossible to know: Does it rise to a Facebook-like magnitude? Drop off like MySpace? Is there someone in a garage somewhere getting ready to reveal a site that tries to out Pinterest. Pinterest? (No doubt, the answer is yes.) Or, what happens if there's a seismic shift and the Internet landscape suddenly changes? As the BBC notes in its story on the G20 \"Web economy,\" even the current desktop world is just a few years from being completely transformed: By 2016 about 80% of all internet users will access the web using a mobile phone. That giants will rise and giants will fall in this new landscape is about the only thing that's certain."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Tips"],"author":"Nicole Williams","title":"Make Cupid's Arrow Hit the Mark: Tips and Tricks for Snagging a Sweetheart AND a Sweet Gig on Valentine's Day","date":"February 7, 2012","content":"It's been a few years since I've been on the dating scene, but I never departed for a date without the essential precursor to heading out with any new beau: doing the Google check. It hasn't taken long for this stealth, inexpensive and revealing trend to hit the job market, and while the predominant talk on the street has been about what not to do (those pictures of the holiday party shenanigans). The good news is that I have a few years of online dating techniques to lean on and YES, they work for your career! : You may think you look fantastic in that picture that your friend took of you back in 1989, but unless you have been able to retain that same youthful glow (not likely), you're better off using a photograph that is no more than five years old. I hear the same lament on the job-seeking front as I do on the dating: I get it, but the problem is that when you walk through that door, will he recognize you? If you look too far off the mark, the person on the other side of the desk will need to get past the feeling of deception and wondering about your level of self confidence before he or she can even get to know that great personality of yours. Beyond the interview, if you're meeting a client at a busy Starbucks or trying to locate someone at a crowded conference better that they can actually recognize you. The best picture is simple head-shot of you in professional attire. Pull back those shoulders, chin up and a confident smile are all you need. And as for the question, No. Not unless you're a vet. : \" I haven't met a single woman (or man for that matter) that doesn't have a physical or at least a mental list of what they are looking for in a date. I'm a big believer that you don't get what you don't ask for, and considering the fact that we spend more time at work than we do with our significant other, it's not a bad idea to sit down and actually define what you're looking for in a dream job. Now, I know this sounds like crazy-talk in light of the current job market, but trust me on this one: the same way having standards make you more attractive in your personal life, the same goes for your professional life. How do you take initiative and actually find the job of your dreams? Take advantage of your own ability for some online reconnaissance. Follow Companies that you're interested in, and identify Groups that contain your industry's best and brightest. That way, not only do you get a sense of who you want to work for, but by the time you get to the interview stage, you're also able to bring all of your unique talents and experiences to the table and help them to see that not only are they the perfect fit for you, but also that you are the perfect fit for them.  I'm not lying when I tell you I've actually read about a woman's love of wine on a resume I received recently, and she was not applying to be a sommelier. So, here's the deal. There are so many ways in which you could summarize yourself, so where do you start, and even more importantly, where do you end? Not unlike the online dating world, the best place to start is not with you, but with whom you are attempting to attract. Of all the great talents and interests you have, the only ones the potential employer or client cares about are those that are going to benefit her business. Do your research (see above), make a list of all the adjectives and ways in which the industry and/or company you're interested in describes themselves, and then match your experiences and skills to what they are looking for using similar language. For example, if they say they are innovative, then so are you! On the more personal front, and round about the point you want to be wrapping up, yes, if you're a distance runner, avid skier or even wine collector, you can include it in your summary. However, it's not about the buzz you get off a great glass of vino, it's about your ability to discern trends, distill research and be a disciplined collector. Your mom raves about the \"great gal\" she met in her virtual book club who is absolutely perfect for you ...not so much. Your best friend who is dating his own super model turned inventor of the snuggle...more like it. The first step is to make sure you're connected to the kind of people who reflect not only who you are but who you aspire to be (you know what they say about Birds of a Feather). And then ask for them to help set you up. When it comes to getting what we want in either our personal or professional life there is nothing like the power of a solid recommendation and LinkedIn makes it easier than ever."},{"post_categories":["Featured","Security"],"author":"Arvind Mani","title":"A More Secure LinkedIn Browsing Experience","date":"February 7, 2012","content":"We are happy to announce LinkedIn now supports for your browsing experience.

The message they have sent us is clear; more than 75% of respondents told us that red tape is a problem and 30% considered it to be a major issue. We hear that message loud and clear and we are determined that this UK Government will leave office having reduced the overall burden of regulation. But we need you, the people trying to navigate the regulatory landscape, to tell us exactly what we need to change. That's why I launched the last year. It allows you to tell us about the regulations that are frustrating you and your business. But it is not just red tape that is hindering economic growth. Outdated regulation is also holding back our most innovative entrepreneurs. New business models — particularly those that involve doing things differently, often enabled by new technologies — are sometimes falling foul of regulations that were intended for another age, or for another purpose entirely. So I announced in November that we are expanding the Red Tape Challenge to examine, not only the regulation which affects the businesses of today, but also the businesses of tomorrow. We've already had some really useful comments ranging from the difficulties faced by new peer-to-peer lending companies, to the burdens of the patent process, and the vagaries of distance selling rules. But I want to make sure we are hearing from as many people as possible. That's why I've set up a new LinkedIn group to provide another forum to share your experiences and discuss possible solutions with a like-minded community. When you identify regulations which are not a fit for purpose, we'll put them on probation and decide which regulations should go and which could be improved."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Nicole Williams","title":"New Year, New You: 5 Career Resolutions to start the Year strong!","date":"January 10, 2012","content":"The Labor Department just announced that 200,000 new jobs were created just last month alone. If your New Year's resolutions have lagged along with the employment rate over the last few years, then get ready to tackle your career with all the momentum that this latest announcement inspires.  If your resolution is sticking with the job you have, don't be lulled into thinking this is the year to sit back and phone it in. In fact, the best strategy for keeping your job is to build your skills and put them out there for all to see, just as if you were tackling the greatest job search of your life. Not sure what new skills are going to make a difference? Go to LinkedIn Skills and type in a talent you have or check out a listing of related skills and new talents you need to stay competitive in your position. You never know you just may end up with the raise you didn't dare to put on your resolution list. If your goal is to get promoted this year, don't do it alone. Success breeds success. Not only do you want to share your relationships and expertise with others, you want others to share their contacts and knowledge with you. One of the most powerful things you can do to build your reputation is to leverage the influence of others. You do this by seeking connections and asking for recommendations. If this sounds daunting, there are two things to consider that will make it easier. First, it's a two-way street. You need to demonstrate you have something to offer by having a thorough profile and your own Rolodex to share. Next, even though it's for a professional purpose, this is a personal ask. Personalize your connection requests and specify what the recommendation you're seeking should entail so it's effective for you and not too time consuming for them.  If your resolution is the more passive goal of being tapped on the shoulder and courted into a new career opportunity, then you may be in luck. With 75 of the Fortune 100 companies using LinkedIn as a recruiting tool, it's never been easier to be discovered. But here's the thing: Even the best hiring managers are not mind readers. Fill out your profile completely (include your volunteer experience and avoid over-used buzzwords that count as filler) and finally add a photo that looks like you at your professional best. Now reach out to at least 50 connections so those second and third tier prospective employers can track you down.  One of the most exciting things that happens in a burgeoning economy is a renewed sense of optimism and with it, the creation of new jobs. But here's the trick: it happens quickly and usually long before a job posting is ever created. If you're strategically tracking industry trends and following companies via LinkedIn, you have the potential to be on top of the job long before the masses start competing for it. Initiative and innovation are two things that hiring managers are looking for; so, writing to the CEO of the company you're following after reading the article on LinkedIn Today that he tweeted and suggesting a new marketing strategy may very well be the key to a job that you didn't know existed.  If there's any single thing you can do in this New Year to make a difference in your career, it is to put yourself out there and network. Opportunities are found through relationships, and I can guarantee that if you're stuck in your career (and frankly, even if you're not), you don't have enough of them. The whole concept of networking can conjure up images of awkward asks like, Can you help me find a job? Over a highly-orchestrated networking lunch or event after work. The truth is that networking should be happening anywhere and everywhere and is simply the building of authentic relationships. That means a little get-to-know you long before you need anything is the difference between getting the job, promotion, recommendation, introduction, raise and not.

According to , the editor of Inc.com, the singular definition was created 37 years ago by Harvard Business School professor : Entrepreneurship is the pursuit of opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled. In other words, an entrepreneur spots a goal and ignores all the reasons why he or she will never achieve it. Lack of money? Lack of clear path? Lack of talent? Lack of outside approvals? None of those are deterrents. It's a great definition and nearly 40 years ago, it probably helped separate the careerists from the creators. But today, Stevenson's definition can be applied to just about everyone. To make it in business today, you have to either think like an entrepreneur or be one, a philosophy that can be seen by looking at our top stories of the week, which we compile by analyzing the articles most shared by LinkedIn's more than 135 million members. From Fast Company's opus on embracing the no-career-path path to Mashable's look at the top startups for 2012, it's clear that nimbleness and scarcity are things workers are starting to assume, not avoid. The list: The most-shared story of the week demonstrates the spread of the entrepreneurship-for-everyone idea best. Joe Reynolds, the founder of Chicago's Red Frog Events, talks about why every company should adopt his policy of having no vacation rules. Red Froggers can take as much time off as necessary, whenever necessary. His is a classic startup concept: When you've got everyone focused on a common goal, you can give people time off as they need because they'll always be working toward the cause (and they may never take the time off, anyway). Before they leave they'll make sure transitions are handled beautifully. And even on vacation, they'll still be thinking about work. \"Every last Red Frog employee is unflinchingly focused and devoted to our mission,\" Reynolds writes. He also points out the policy helps when recruiting new people. Outside of a few big employers like Netflix, eradication of vacation is a nonstarter. Businesses have developed processes and checks to ensure that things move smoothly and that resources (which, according to the definition, entrepreneurs don't have) are monitored and controlled. Paid time off is part of the established company plan. Instead of offering unlimited time off, they offer salaries, career ladders, defined perks, and HR support. Yet professionals went crazy for the Reynolds concept, sharing the article to their networks and beyond. When a story on vacation plans goes viral like it's a LOLCats page, it's worth paying attention. The other top story: Fast Company editor 's tale at what he calls \"Generation Flux” the workers of today who change titles and collect skills like they're frequent flier miles. For these professionals, there are always new opportunities to be pursued and they'll hop from resource-rich big company to startup as necessary to deploy what they've learned and to acquire new talents. The future of business whether you're running one, starting one or working for one \"is pure chaos,\" says Safian. Here's the conundrum: When businesspeople search for the right forecast--the road map and model that will define the next era--no credible long-term picture emerges. There is one certainty, however. The next decade or two will be defined more by fluidity than by any new, settled paradigm; if there is a pattern to all this, it is that there is no pattern. Entrepreneurs have operated in this environment their whole existence. The rest of us are just now coming into the fold. I wonder what the singular definition of \"worker\" is?"},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News"],"author":"Daniel Roth","title":"Top 5 Stories on LinkedIn: Concern About SOPA Dominates The Conversation","date":"January 20, 2012","content":"Not since the in the fall of 2011 has one story so dominated the attention of professionals. The fight over the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA -- a U.S. House of Representatives bill designed to block online copyright violations took three of the top five headlines in our weekly look at the most-shared stories by 135+ million LinkedIn members. From professionals in the IT industry to aviation and aerospace workers, concern over how the Internet might work or might stop working with the bill's potential passing brought a torrent of sharing. Here's the full list: Mashable grabbed the top spot with an usual pairing: It had , Mashable's chief architect, try to decipher the bill. And \"decipher\" is really the best word. As Heald wrote: If a programmer on my team wrote code as convoluted as this bill, I would fire him on the spot. Heald focused on a few areas of special concern, including how easy it would be for nearly all websites - or web users - to run afoul of the law. Take sections 103, which sets out to define what it means for a site to be all-about-theft. The language is broad enough, says Heald, that a site just has to offer some way for copyright-violating content to be uploaded. That could come from a photo upload feature, a comment box, or a video service. He goes on to look what would happen if you uploaded a video of yourself singing a popular song in the shower. That act, he says, may win you a following, but it could also provide you a criminal record. \"You don't have to receive any money. You don't have to gain anything from your video. Simply receiving 2,500 views on a song you sung, which happens to have copyright held by someone else, makes you a felon.\" Other top articles look at the tick-tock of the law's progress: Forbes pointed out that President Obama had come out against SOPA and similar bill Protect IP. And after some websites went dark to protest the bills, Mashable kept a running tab of all of the Congressmen who had suddenly yanked their acts. That ran from Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (a co-sponsor of Protect IP) to Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch. \"Do you think the widespread website blackouts, such as Wikipedia's, are to credit for the bills' supporter drain?\" asks Mashable. Now the focus shifts to what's next. As Forbes points out, the copyright battles aren't going away anytime soon (just after we compiled the data, for example, file storage and sharing site Megaupload was shut down). \"Just like piracy itself, this debate isn't over,\" says Forbes contributor . \"Expect more bills to move forward, although the wording in future legislation is expected to be more narrowly focused in an attempt to appease the current administration.\" One thing is clear: the professional world turned into this bill in an unprecedented numbers.

A small favor: Would you mind socializing this blog post with your colleagues and ideating a response? Two sentences, three of the worst management terms of 2011, . Some of the others: weaponize, socialize, internalize, ideate. I'm not sure I've ever heard weaponize used in a meeting, but maybe I'm just attending the wrong meetings. In any case, the last week which bridged 2011 and 2012 ideated some year-end frivolity, sure, but mostly professionals were interested in big, buzzword-free topics. Top stories included everything from why Best Buy was sure to fail to how education was going to go free. The full list: It's not surprising that two school-related pieces grabbed the attention of workers everywhere. Both tackled a major question with significant implications for the future: How do you make sure education is widespread and not just reserved for the wealthy? Finland has handled this by making all schools free - something the author says American educators routinely overlook as they study Finland's success: Only a small number of independent schools exist in Finland, and even they are all publicly financed. None is allowed to charge tuition fees. There are no private universities, either. This means that practically every person in Finland attends public school, whether for pre-K or a Ph.D. MIT, meanwhile, has even broader implications: It's building a complete set of courses available online, for free, and that come with official certificates of completion. That means top brains everywhere, not just those who can afford to enroll or to travel to the U.S., can learn from the best of MIT and have some document to prove that they've mastered the information. Forbes writer James Marshall Crotty calls it \"nothing short of revolutionary\" and points out that it could also pose a challenge to the for-profit online universities. Also under threat: Best Buy, says Forbes writer Larry Downes. He calls Best Buy's wound self-inflicted and looks at what the company can and should be doing differently. Why self-inflicted? Downes spells it out simply: There's no magic to retailing 'hot products' and doing so at a profit.  Efficient inventory and distribution, managing customer relationships for the long term, competitive pricing, pre and post-sales support for technically complex items:  these are the most basic elements of competitive advantage for a retailer that actually wants to stay in business, now but in the past as well.  Most of what Amazon does right has nothing to do with technology or the Internet at all. The story is worth a read and the lessons stretch across all industries. Folks in the education sector, especially, might want to internalize the learnings.

Famous quotes about \"flaming out\" from Henry Ford (\"Success is 99% failure\") to Mickey Rooney (\"You always pass failure on the way to success\") cover the wall, sharing room with the hand-written admissions of disasters and bad decisions of his employees at Dun & Bradstreet Credibility Corp. Through these personal tales of failure, Stibel has built a culture that encourages risk taking and humility.  He lays out the reasons why he embraces failure and why you should, too in an article on HBR.com that was one of the most shared stories this week on LinkedIn. In fact, failure seemed to be the theme of the week, as you can see from the Top 5: Learning from failure, of course, is a key component of the Silicon Valley-inspired business culture that has spread well beyond Route 101. Today, the scars of unrealized ambition are displayed proudly, not covered up. Small businesses everywhere, for instance, can look at the ugly early designs of what are now the world's biggest websites as highlighted by Mashable and see a reason to launch and iterate on an imperfect design or idea. Never launching will definitely bring failure; getting something out there and facing and fixing issues could lead to glory. As , a software developer in Greece, tweeted in response to the story: \"Are you still working on the perfect design for your app?\" Writing for Inc., Ilya Pozin (his second week in a row on the leader board) details how people fail by multitasking, jumping to answer email and setting unachievable goals. Like Stibel, Pozin uses poor decisions as a way to think about how to make better ones. As the year wraps up, it's no surprise that such stories of failure and redemption are bubbling to the top of professionals' must-read lists. The economy is showing signs of hope for 2012 (in some sectors), unemployment is dipping, and companies have cash to put to work; now feels like the perfect time to set a game plane for how to take off next year.

So I went straight to the source and asked for some tips from two active LinkedIn recruiters -- Zachary Simon, Director of Global Executive Talent Acquisition for , and Cyndi Klein, Technical Recruiter for . Zach and Cyndi generously answered all of my prying questions and shared the following insider tips: “Make sure you incorporate a lot of keywords for the kind of job you’re looking for,” says Cyndi. “As a recruiter, I run through LinkedIn and I look for the key requirements of [each available] job. I look for very specific skills, so have these in your profile.” For example, describe that you have experience as a “systems administrator for Linux” not the more generic “support technician.” If you’re not sure what skills or terms to use, look for the keywords mentioned in the job postings for positions you want and the LinkedIn profiles of people who currently have those jobs. Cyndi also advises that job seekers focus on what you’ve done in your current or past jobs to make an impact. In other words, your LinkedIn profile should focus on your accomplishments and not your tasks. Zach agrees and reminds job seekers that tone matters as well: “Convey your expertise in what you do and your enthusiasm for your role and your results.” Recruiters using the tool won’t be able to view your photo in their searches; however, recruiters and hiring managers may come across your profile while interacting in groups or elsewhere on the site. This means your profile photo needs to make the right first impression. “Don’t use a casual, too personal picture on LinkedIn,” says Zach. “Recruiters won’t be impressed with a picture from a family picnic or of you at a sporting event.” (I agree, unless you are a caterer in the former example or work in the sports industry in the latter.) Stick with a professional headshot of you alone, preferably with a smile, and you’ll be just fine. “I am not impressed with profiles that have too many recommendations,” says Zach. “To me, it looks like the person is constantly asking for these and it looks a bit self-indulgent.” So, what’s the right number? My best advice is to have at least one recommendation for each job you list on your profile. Beyond that, only post recommendations that will impress recruiters and hiring managers (remember that you don’t have to display every recommendation you have; be strategic). To Cyndi, this means having recommendations from former bosses and some peers. “Make sure people are recommending you who really know you or are people you’ve had an impact on,” she advises. “I look at recommendations to tell if someone is going to be a good cultural fit. I look for mention of soft skills, like being good with customers or having a good work ethic. You have to be able to do the job, but I want to know what it’s really like to work with you.” LinkedIn group memberships are another way recruiters assess job candidates. Zach advises job seekers to join LinkedIn groups that are “relevant to your work, your education and even outside interests, such as community activities and philanthropies.” Why do recruiters care about your affiliations? “Your groups can be a reflection of your priorities,” he explains. This is especially important for career changers, recent grads and people who’ve been out of work for a prolonged period. Group memberships can show you are active in an industry even if you’re not currently working in it. For instance, if you’re trying to transition from sales into a career in financial analysis, you should drop out of sales-related groups and join groups related to finance and accounting. This shows that you’re serious about the career change (and it also helps your networking efforts). Be aware that recruiters are looking beyond the content of your LinkedIn profile. They’re looking at your list of connections as well. According to Cyndi, “Make sure you’re connected to people who are relevant [to your career interests].” Cyndi likes to hire professionals who are well networked in their industry, so she advises job seekers to “connect with all of your peers.” This also increases your chances of a recruiter finding your profile while looking at the profile of one of your colleagues. When I asked Cyndi for her biggest pet peeve as a recruiter using LinkedIn, she didn’t hesitate with her answer. “The worst thing is when you can tell someone is sending mass emails,” she says. “Customize your approach to each position or person,” she recommends. “We don’t want someone who just wants to get a job anywhere. We want someone who is passionate about working here. Make us feel special!” This means always customizing any cover letters you send through LinkedIn and even tweaking your profile when you apply for a position to highlight the qualifications a specific employer is seeking. For instance, you could change your profile headline to feature some keywords that match a particular position description or rewrite the first paragraph of your Summary statement to highlight those keywords and relevant experience. This will help your profile stand out for the position you want, but it won’t exclude you from consideration for other jobs. Whenever you send a connection request or InMail message, always, always, always customize your message to the person you are contacting as well. Generic connection requests and template emails won’t impress anyone. Finally, don’t be afraid to reach out directly to a recruiter on LinkedIn. Cyndi says that Rackspace recently hired two people who reached out to the company’s recruiting managers on LinkedIn. How do you do this effectively? Cyndi advises that you only send a message to a recruiter when you feel you’d be a good fit for a specific position the company has posted. If this is the case, first submit your resume for the position and then send a message to the specific recruiter who has posted the opportunity (you can find this information on the LinkedIn job posting). “Be direct and to the point,” says Cyndi. “For example, you might write, ‘I just applied for XYZ position and I wanted to reach out to you directly to let you know I applied.’” This isn’t a guaranteed strategy, of course, but in today’s challenging economy, every bit of extra effort counts.

After reading the entire book in one sitting, I was absolutely convinced that Tony should be an inDay speaker at LinkedIn. There are so many similarities between Zappos and LinkedIn - from our intense focus on our members and customers to our commitment to nurturing an incredible employee culture. So my colleague and I started encouraging folks around the company to email and tweet our ask to Tony. We even had an ad with Tony's picture on it that we were planning to show the next time he logged onto LinkedIn. Luckily, before that panned out, our founder sealed the deal with Tony and he came to LinkedIn last Friday to speak to a standing room only crowd at our Mountain View headquarters. The response from my coworkers was resoundingly positive, with \"awesome\" being the most common word used to describe the talk. This experience really showed me just how uniquely empowering LinkedIn's culture is, that a determined passionate group of employees could so easily get support from the top to help us cross the finish line."},{"post_categories":["Product News"],"author":"Anita Lillie","title":"Group Statistics: Designing for Clear Insights","date":"December 8, 2011","content":"A month ago we launched our Groups Statistics dashboard to help our users learn more about LinkedIn Groups. In today's post, I'll delve into a few of the design decisions that made the product what it is today. I came to work at LinkedIn because of the enormous potential we have with data. We can provide millions of members with unique insights to advance their careers. With Groups we saw a huge opportunity to make a tool our members could use to find the right groups for their professional development. We can't build a tool that's perfect for everyone, so we have to narrow our intended audience a bit. We targeted this product at members who are looking to join a new group and members who want to gain a better understanding of the groups they are already members of. While group administrators can benefit tremendously from this same information, we didn't design it primarily for them. This is one of the reasons our Group Stats dashboards are not more densely packed with data; we're aiming to show users the most important parts of the big picture, rather than overwhelm them with details. Choosing which data to surface is one of the trickiest steps. We want to show data that provides insights even in the most general case, and more importantly, wanted to show data that users care about. When joining a group, we know the key elements members care about -- group growth, demographics, and activity -- so we carefully chose to highlight data around those topics. At the same time though, we had to choose not to show data about other items, such as more detailed trends in volume of job posts, schools members attended, or member age. Though this data is quite interesting, it's not pertinent to our audience and use case. We assigned a priority to each of the types of data we included, which in turn helped determine the layout. Some very important pieces of data merited a chart (e.g., number of comments over time, which is sustained and substantial in a healthy group) while others (e.g., number of jobs posted last week) only needed a number. Within each tab, we placed data points users want to see first at the top of the page. We tried many designs until we narrowed in on our final one. I've included a few of them below. You can see that at various times we tried different layouts, typography, and color palettes. One evening about a month into the project, we decided to scrap everything we had designed previously and start again. This was because we stepped back from the designs and realized that we were crowding the page with too much information, that we'd been designing for a much more technical user than we'd intended. And while it was a very difficult decision to make that evening, I look back on it now and am so glad we have a better product because of it. We aim to keep all of our products as simple as possible. In Group Statistics, this meant showing only the minimal data necessary. You'll notice that we never show more than one chart at a time, only show charts when direct comparison (across time or category) is necessary, and use just one color throughout. We even pared down the chart styles themselves, removing axis and divider lines and axis labels (the content of which is apparent by context alone) in order to de-clutter the page and let the data really shine. When it comes to data, design is more about addressing real data than idealized situations. When we tested our initial designs on real groups, we realized we'd have to make some changes. For example, I had designed the group membership space to accommodate a group size up to 99,999. But it turns out that we already have groups on LinkedIn with over 100,000 members, and several more about to break the barrier. So we had to adjust the area devoted to that metric and tweak the font size to make it more readable. We saw this same issue when looking at growth rates for groups: Some groups grow so rapidly (5+ digit growth %) that area and font size tweaks wouldn't cut it; so we added a rocket ship badge for those explosive-growth situations... a badge that will always fit in the space we have. The extra bonus here is that the rocket becomes an award for our fastest-growing groups! Testing with real data also helped us realize that some groups are not yet ready to benefit from Group Statistics. Some groups are so young that showing trends in their growth and activity don't make sense. So we spent some time honing the rules that determine when a group's statistics get displayed. Even though we tried to test for all circumstances, we missed a few things. In cases like this, it's often our users who help us improve the product by giving us their feedback. Immediately after we launched the product, some users pointed out that they would like more explanation of the data categories, or a different metric for growth, and even pointed out specific issues with our geographic data that confused them. With this invaluable feedback, we can make future versions of Group Stats more useful. When designing most web-based products these days, sharing is key. We want to enable discussions to spring from our data, let you share with friends and colleagues, and generate more interest in groups as a whole. Our share buttons help users initiate discussions on several platforms. In order to allow users to share Groups data openly, we also made the aggregate data publicly shareable, even if the group itself is not open. This product was built by a team that had to adapt to changing designs and deadlines. I owe major props to for her help with layout and typography. I credit with reminding us to step back in the middle of the process and ultimately to ensure we were focused on the end-user experience. Numerous developers and engineers - including , , , , and - put every piece of data and every pixel in place. And our trusty Product Manager, , continuously cleared the way for each of us to be as productive as possible. This has been one of my favorite teams to work with, and it's my privilege to keep working with them every day."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News"],"author":"Daniel Roth","title":"Business Goes Visual -- A Look at the Most-Shared Stories This Week","date":"December 9, 2011","content":"With only a few crucial weeks left before books close on the year, professionals seem to be spending their time, well, coasting.

Maybe during the last year some of our members scrubbed their profiles of buzzwords and more uniquely described themselves? Or maybe there has been a huge growth in the number of innovative, motivated, entrepreneurial team players who are results-oriented and thrive in fast-paced environments. To the data! We took a look at the more than 135 million professional profiles on our site and here are the top 10 buzzwords for the United States: This year's top buzzword in the U.S. is \"creative\". What differences do we see from last year? We had a couple of methodological changes [1], and setting those aside, we see that \"creative\", \"effective\", \"communication skills\" and \"strategic planning\" have appeared on the list this year. Comparing words that could make it on both this year's and last year's list, we can see that last year's top buzzword \"extensive experience\" still makes it to top three. \"Motivated\" is now ranked higher than \"innovative\" and words such as \"results oriented\", \"fast paced\", \"entrepreneurial\" are off the list. Given the large international representation of our members, here are the number one buzzwords for a selection of countries: : Australia, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, UK, US : Brazil : France : India : Italy : Ireland : Spain : Singapore So if you're a LinkedIn member in Germany, France or Italy, you might be a creative, dynamic problem solver!

We aggregated the adjectives in the summary section of our member's public profiles and removed some overused nouns (e.g., \"mobile\") and other irrelevant words. From that list we sorted words by frequency and took the top 10 for each country. The main difference from last year is that we took more of an agnostic approach and let the adjectives sort themselves out, vs. starting with a list of 40 predefined buzzwords and ranking them."},{"post_categories":["Groups"],"author":"Ian McCarthy","title":"Polls in Groups: The Easiest Way to Join the Professional Conversation","date":"December 14, 2011","content":"I'm pleased to announce the newest, easiest way to participate in professional conversations happening in over a million LinkedIn Groups today. Welcome to the first LinkedIn application within Groups - Polls - that will be rolling out to all members over the next few days. A key reason our members use LinkedIn Groups is to share insights with like-minded professionals. Voting on polls now provides the same quick convenience of clicking \"Like\", but with also the richer point of view of a comment. We've also seen in testing that many members elaborate further on their choice in the familiar comments area that we've provided once you vote in a poll. Plus, in open groups, any member of LinkedIn can vote on a poll, just as they can \"Like\" any discussion or comment in an open group. Moderators of Groups have always shared with us that they're looking for easy, time sensitive ways to generate conversations within the group. Sharing an article or blogging your thoughts on the latest topics takes a while. Now, creating a poll provides a simple way to unlock the insights of the members of the group. Poll creation follows the same rules managers have set up for moderating discussion creation, including any requirements for approval in the Submissions Queue.

Here are top five reasons to start, build or even just to try out LinkedIn groups: There is nowhere on the web but LinkedIn were senior professionals from every walk of life congregate and network. If you want access to industry gurus, academic thought leaders, or business leaders, LinkedIn is the place to go. Groups offer an exceptional opportunity to reach out to the people that you want to talk to most. Starting or joining a group gives you the exact right context and setting to engage in focused dialogue and networking. LinkedIn groups are the cocktail parties or reading clubs to the vast stadiums of people that social media has become. I am confident in saying that you will find no greater learning experience than by participating in and moderating group discussions. You may not want to be at the front of an audience. You may not want to deal with thousands of people or position yourself as any kind of industry or professional expert. But I can tell you, LinkedIn groups is not about that. Instead, they give you the chance to dive into what you are most passionate about professionally and explore your areas of interest with your peers and experts by your side. You can learn something new and meet someone new every day; groups are your chance to be a student again. If you have a company blog or perhaps have set up your own website, you know how you sometimes feel like you are talking to an empty room. LinkedIn is no empty room. By forming a tightly knit member community and then actively participating in the discussions, group managers enjoy unprecedented access into professional fields and experts. As a group moderator, you can pick out choice discussions to feature and call attention to members in order to form relationships with your members. It's easy to start or feature discussions, and then comment and engage with your community. A new member joins LinkedIn every second. Membership has grown to . With features like LinkedIn Today however, people are now seeing LinkedIn not just as an online resume, but as a place to find content and engage in discussion. LinkedIn groups lets you tap into the one true platform for daily professional conversation. Not only can you experience rapid membership growth because of this traffic, but more importantly, you can also develop a focused member base. If you start a group that you are passionate about, that will show through in your group management. LinkedIn's made it easier than ever with to monitor membership and discussion. One of the most important ways to give back to a group is to share industry articles and interesting LinkedIn group discussions. LinkedIn's group announcement feature and the ability to pick a daily manager's choice allows you to easily share your relevant content with the group. It's a great way to participate with your members and get feedback. In 2007, everyone I knew was joining LinkedIn and becoming passionate advocates of its professional networking. But when LinkedIn introduced Groups, I knew that they were on to something really big. It turns out I was right (or more appropriately, LinkedIn was right.) Since I started the LinkedIn Group -- -- back in November of 2007, more than 230,000 members have joined. Four years later, the group is growing faster than ever with more than 400 new members every day. Back then, I didn't know everything LinkedIn Groups could do for me. Social media was new, exciting, and it felt like a club. These days, you might say people are catching on: LinkedIn users have started over one million LinkedIn groups. The tips I've shared above are what I've learned as a group moderator, growing our community from scratch to nearly quarter of a million members. Hope my learnings as a group moderator and participant are helpful to those of you considering LinkedIn Groups."},{"post_categories":["Latin America","International"],"author":"Osvaldo Barbosa de Oliveira","title":"LinkedIn chegou ao Brasil!","date":"November 30, 2011","content":"É com muito orgulho que venho anunciar o lançamento do primeiro escritório do LinkedIn na América Latina, em São Paulo, Brasil.

In addition to behind-the-scenes improvements to our content management system, speeding up page load times and building a foundation for language improvements down the road, here are changes you'll see today: Our primary goal with the redesign was to shine the spotlight on the content, minus all the clutter. We removed a few widgets and just kept the three that's tied to the content - Status Updates, Photos and Videos. And, we also wanted to feature posts through a more visually appealing feature section. I think Dan Frommer said it best: Don't make your site more complicated than it needs to be. Like editing text, you can often improve design by deleting. That doesn't mean you shouldn't have photos and illustrations, just make sure they're adding to the experience. Try to keep load times as short as possible, and note that many readers may be using mobile devices (and slow connections) to access your site. Make the right tradeoffs between revenue, flashiness, and clutter. In addition, we wanted to make all the content, including the archives easily accessible to all readers.

While yes, it may be best that you don’t find yourself attracted to the woman in accounting, or that you down a club soda rather than a glass of chardonnay at the company picnic, and steer clear of the water cooler conversation about the impending merger, but the reality is: she’s cute, it’s cold, and if you’re about to be down-sized, it’s better to be on the in than the out. Whether you like it or not, gossip is a part of the career landscape. While you should absolutely steer-clear of the malicious, bullying, back-stabbing, falsehood kind of word-on-the-street, there are times and places when getting and having the goods are going to be hugely advantageous to your career. From lay-offs to promotions, the truth is having your ear to the ground will help ensure you don't miss out on the goodies that may affect your career. But there is a quid pro quo expected as part of the rumor mill and if you’re not willing to participate, you’re going to be out of the loop.  The best way to ensure you are armed and ready is to have some factual and positive news to share. Follow your co-workers' as well as other companies within your industry so you can pipe in with comments like, \"Did you hear that Bob got a promotion?\"   The other trickier but very potentially powerful element of the Give to Get concept is using it to establish loyalty and allegiance.  If you hear that there is a promotion in the pipeline that may affect your boss, deciding to share that information may very well ensure that she’ll have your back come your yearly review. One of the most effective ways of leading the direction of gossip in a positive and productive direction is to be prepared.   You never know when you’re going to hop on the elevator to find your boss who wants to know what you think about the latest IPO or who made a startling entrance at last night’s marketing gala.   Ideally, you’ll already be up to speed and ready to take advantage of this impromptu and relationship-building tete a tete. One of the realities of this digital era is that news comes at us at a fast and furious pace, and more often than not, is delivered to us online.   I have heard more than one story of an employee learning her colleague has just been laid off via her profile status or that the company is in financial distress via a newsfeed rather than from the C Suite. Check out your industry-specific newsfeed to help you prioritize and sort through the news that’s making the rounds. Out of the Office:  While I'm not particularly proud of it, The Bachelorette is on my TiVo - and it turns out it's on my boss's as well.  The purpose of gossip is often to get past the day-to-day grind of work.  A little detour into the lives of the Real Housewives can be a powerful way to safely bond over the lives of others.   And in some cases it can even translate into an informative workplace discussion. Mad Men regularly makes the rounds of marketing industry publications and .   Frivolous and unrealistic maybe, but at the end of the long day, it’s better to be talking about Don Draper's love life than your boss's. Speaking of which, here's a little lesson for those of us on the receiving end of gossip, especially when it comes to the world of office dating.  Speculation is infinitely more interesting than reality.  There are three ways to stifle the gossip-mongers when it's your life and career on the block. (1) Tell the truth: I'm not recommending sharing TMI here!  Just a simple, mature acknowledgment of the relationship will do just fine. (2) Direct confrontation:  When it comes to the bad kind of gossip, the culprits are generally bullies and they tend to back off when faced with a simple \"What did you say?\" (3) Distraction:  Being the focus of gossip isn't so bad when it's about the kick-ass job you did on the client proposal. Update your profile status with lots of fun, positive and team-based congratulatory messages, and you'll be sure to get the right kind of attention."},{"post_categories":["Asia Pacific","LinkedIn Life"],"author":"Swasti Sharma","title":"InDay: Culture from across the globe","date":"November 23, 2011","content":"We kicked off the day with our first cultural competition.

It let’s men be men. This cause and movement is for the dads of the world. Those fathers, uncles, brothers, grandfathers that have been or could be impacted at any point in time. This is for them. This is for those of us who have lost someone to cancer. This is for the thought of loosing someone close, someone important to us. Men in general don’t like to admit something is wrong so if we do something as simple as make ourselves and the men in our lives talk to our doctors, we’ve made progress. I’m a proud supporter of the Movember movement and have been incredibly humbled by the amount of support my colleagues and friends have poured into this cause. It was never a question of “if”, it was a question of “how much”. So far, we've raised nearly USD $28,000.

The crowd arrived early under the bright blue sky to enjoy the berries and cream along with the mimosas that set the tone for a thrilling match between the last men standing from a grueling summer long tournament, and .  The mood of the two opponents was light-hearted and witty, just what you would expect from the two pros. The first set hinged on an unforced Cadigan error that allowed Roslansky to battle back from 15-40 to break Cadigan's serve to go up 4-3, the only break of the first set. Both players exhibited the skills that carried through the rigorous tournament that WimbledIn is famous for. Cadigan’s powerful serves and mind-blowing forehands were exchanged for Roslansky's finesse and incredible passing shots. The second set resembled the first, save the break. Neither player could break the other, and so it went as such until the set was even at 6-6. It was in the 2nd set tie-break, leading 5-4 that Cadigan earned a point on one of the most thrilling rallies in this year's tournament. When Roslansky stretched to get what appeared to be a sure Cadigan winner it set off a sequence that one would have to see to believe. Ryan's desperate stretch, where his racket seemed to extend eternally from his arm, sent the ball high in the air. Cadigan lined up the slam only to be thwarted by Ryan's self-defense return, leaving the ball to hit the top of the net, dropping delicately to the ground and most certainly to bounce a second time when Cadigan's full out dive sent the ball back over the net. Not to be outdone Ryan firmly returned the ball down the sideline only to have Cadigan take the impossible shot while diving headlong into the sun and mimosa-drenched front row sending the ball back over the net. Cadigan and Roslansky were now tied at 1 set each. As the 3rd set began, the talk in the crowd was that the longer the match goes the more it favors Cadigan. The pre-game chatter in the stands about Roslansky's training habits reappeared as the 3rd set approached and was the main factor in how mid-match wagers were being placed. What no one could have imagined was the grit and determination that both men displayed as they battled for the coveted WimbledIn plate. The heat began to take its toll on Roslansky as he fell victim to severe leg cramps. The injury time benefitted both players as they kept digging deeper to find the energy to continue. The one constant of the match was each players consistent serves. Breaks were hard to come by, which led us deep into the 3rd set and an 8-8 tie. It was then that the tide turned as Roslansky was able to display his fancy footwork and pinpoint placement to finally break Cadigan and take a 9-8 lead. During Roslansky's serve Cadigan staved off 3 matchpoints but when Cadigan returned a Roslansky serve into the net, and followed that with a beautiful forehand blaster that just went wide, the match and glory belonged solely to the humble and gracious champion, Ryan Roslansky."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Nicole Williams","title":"3 Ways to Successfully Pursue Professional Happiness","date":"November 17, 2011","content":"Despite the global economic crisis and what feels like an endless cycle of doom and gloom in the world of work, we seem to have found a bright spot. In a recent survey conducted of more than 12,000 professionals from around the globe the vast majority indicated they are actually happy with their current job. If you’re shaking your head thinking your glass isn’t quite as full as for those individuals, we thought we’d share three ways to finding a little more happiness (and success) in your career. . Happiness correlates with the feeling of power both over ourselves and our performance so it’s not surprising that the survey found that more than half of all global professionals feel like if they work hard and demonstrate results, they’ll have the opportunity to advance…and they’re right. But the key here is in the demonstration. From (after making sure you and your boss are connected) to mentioning how delighted the client was with your new marketing strategy while riding the elevator together, now is not the time to sit back and play the wallflower. Get out of the mindset of being fearful of being perceived as a show-off.  Make it appear effortless (as in, don’t complain or lament how hard you’re working) and make sure to include the fact that your team was an integral part of your success (which frankly makes work infinitely more fun) and you’ll become that much closer to a mountain of perks. . And what will make us even happier? Other than in the Netherlands where professionals are happy where they’re at, the majority of us want our efforts to be acknowledged and rewarded in the form of a promotion. But here’s the thing we all need to remember:  a promotion won’t just land in our lap.   They need to be pursued with effort (take the initiative to learn a new skill), require demonstrable results (make sure you add those new to your profile), and are best negotiated for in the context of supporting a team (offer it up).  Oh yeah, and putting a smile to your face when you ask doesn’t hurt either. . Sure, you didn’t get a raise this year but you have a kick butt manager who makes sure you’re front and center at client meetings reaping all the glory.  At this point, at least you have a job and a healthy dose of appreciation makes work infinitely more enjoyable…and will help you be more successful. Think of it this way: the more thankful you are for what’s going right, the more you’re going to enjoy your job, the better you will perform and the more likely you are to be rewarded.  At the end of the day, the majority of us have to work, and considering the fact that at least 40 of our hours are going to be spend on the job we may as well make them good and attitude has a lot to do with it. Gratitude is contagious.  The more you focus on what you’re thankful for in your job (even if it’s the free coffee and the walking distance commute) the more likely good things will come your way."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Nicole Williams","title":"LinkedIn and Dr. Drew’s Lifechangers on “Putting America back to Work”","date":"November 18, 2011","content":"This winter, LinkedIn is teaming up with Dr. Drew’s Lifechangers for a joint effort called, “ .” Twelve companies (from to ) have already joined LinkedIn and Lifechangers to offer close to 300 jobs to professionals who live in the Los Angeles / Southern California area.

Immediately. In his entertaining essay, , investor and author James Altucher violates all of the rules of good corporate behavior. He says that college is a waste of money, which teaches neither technical nor life skills (“nonbeliever” – strike one); complains of being betrayed by girlfriends, business partners, even his own psyche (“victim” – strike two); and declaims on everything from what makes for good writing to why students get A's in business school (“know-it-all” – strike three). But his main point is that everything he learned in business and investing came no thanks to 5 years and $100,000 in university payments. The fact that Altucher’s 2,600-word essay caught fire signals that the debate around college’s value is gaining traction. For now, the discussion is largely confined to the tech world (the story ).

The latter category is usually of the head-nod variety: as you read, you nod knowing that the tips are things you should be doing. The wisdom is smart, but conventional. The question the higher education industry needs to figure out is whether Altucher’s thoughts are being shared because they’re so odd and interesting — or whether people are reading and nodding along.

Millions of business cards are exchanged everyday, and CardMunch is at the heart of solving this age-old problem. In fact, millions of business cards have been digitized on CardMunch to date. By using the new CardMunch app, you now have access to deeper and richer information about the person behind the card -- via the LinkedIn profile -- who you know in common, where they’ve worked, where they went to school, and much, much more! For the first time, we’ll be connecting the physical world of business cards with the digital world of LinkedIn profiles, and helping millions of professionals everywhere take the world of contacts and phone numbers into the future of professional networking. We’ve also done a major re-haul of the CardMunch experience with particular focus on how we can make outbound professionals more successful and productive. As LinkedIn Mobile has grown 400% year-over-year in page views, we are continuously looking for ways to bring value to professionals and we’ve done this with the new CardMunch app. We’ve rebuilt the entire CardMunch experience from the ground up with powerful new features to make professionals smarter and more efficient, while on the road. Here are some new features all of our members will find valuable: The new CardMunch application introduces a brand-new and stunning visual experience. Additionally, our completely re-designed camera experience allows users to capture cards faster than ever. We've reduced the entire application to 3 super intuitive and easy to use screens: (1) Card capture (2) Contact list (3) Contact details and LinkedIn profiles. We’ve introduced the power of the LinkedIn ecosystem and combined it with features our users crave: Past versions of our app only showed you the information gleaned from the business card you scanned but with this version we wanted to bring to our members the richness of profile information that only a site like LinkedIn possess. Once you scan your card, we’ll map that information with their LinkedIn profile, along with photos of contacts, common connections, past work experience, education. Now you know the person behind the card - the who, what, where and when for every business card you scan. Finally, since CardMunch is used by professionals - both outbound professionals to the newbie attending her first conference - we’ve taken special pains to include some powerful functionality that’ll help any member. For e.g. We’re thrilled with this current iteration that expands on the original app by adding features our members had asked for.

For starters, we’ve made it easier than ever to find the right events to attend. And, more importantly, we’re adding a healthy dose of LinkedIn’s secret sauce - an easy way to find and connect with the right folks attending those events. In the past year alone, we've had over a million RSVPs to hundreds of thousands of professional events on LinkedIn Events. We've seen events on topics ranging from to , and everything in between. And we're only beginning to scratch the surface of what we can offer for professional events. Because we understand the importance of events to our members, we’ve taken their feedback and made some key improvements to LinkedIn Events. Staying up-to-date on the most important events in your industry can be difficult. We’ve taken a LinkedIn lens to this problem. First, you may be interested in the events your network is organizing - so those updates will appear in your Network Update stream. Next, your will provide an ever-evolving set of event recommendations based on your location, industry, network, and more.  Finally, there are times when you’re looking for a particular event or type of event. That’s why we’ve implemented a full-featured events search, complete with controls to filter by industry, location, and time. The common thread in all professional events is people. Perhaps someone at this event thinks you’d be a great fit for a job opening. Perhaps a fellow event attendee could be the perfect sales lead. And maybe that industry luminary you’ve been looking up to for years will be attending - here’s your chance to introduce yourself. We’ve built a set of tools to highlight people at the event. For a quick glance at some valuable new connections, we’ve built a feature called “Attendees You May Want To Meet”.  If you’re interested in digging deeper into the attendee list, try filtering the attendees by their industry and company to find the right person. Whether you’re a large conference organizer or just hosting a brown bag session, you’re always looking for ways to put your event in front of the right group of professionals. We’ll help you put your best foot forward with customizable event logos. Your event will automatically be picked up through search and Events You May Be Interested In. You can also easily share your event to your networks:   Once you’ve signed up for an event, we want to make the process as convenient as possible for you. Add the event to your calendar and find directions to the event -- you’ll be making connections in no time.

So, when I sat down to write a blog post to help job seekers with military backgrounds, I decided to follow my own advice. I posted a query here on LinkedIn asking veterans if they’d be willing to share some tips for other former servicemen and servicewomen. Not surprisingly, several veterans stepped up immediately to help, as did a few non-veterans who wanted to lend a hand. Here are the top recommendations they shared: Everyone’s first tip was to make sure your LinkedIn profile emphasizes your transferable skills. “Being a marksman with an M-16 has little applicability to supply-chain management,” said Erick S. Van Savage, a former corporal in the USMC, “but attributes such as self-discipline, dedication, leadership, courage, esprit de corps and a strong work ethic have great application to virtually all facets of business.” Veterans looking for work need to emphasize such attributes in their LinkedIn Summary statements and profile Skills sections. “You need to remove all the typical military language from your write-up,” added Robert Martin, MBA, LSSGB, who served in the US Navy and is now an E-6 US Navy and Supply Chain Professional. “Remember, very few of the people you come in contact with on LinkedIn will understand your background. Remember to write [your profile] from the perspective of a civilian because this what you now are.” According to LinkedIn’s research, veterans on LinkedIn have applied their transferable skills to build careers in the following top 10 job functions: If you’re not sure how to frame your military experience in civilian terms, look to your fellow veterans for guidance. Ray Luther, a former US Army Medical Service Corps Officer who is currently Director of Coaching and Development at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business, recommended “searching for other veterans who might have similar stories to yours and see how they are positioning themselves on LinkedIn.” This is a smart suggestion, and with hundreds of thousands of LinkedIn members with U.S. military service, you’ll have a lot of profiles to choose from. Once you have a strong LinkedIn profile, the next step for job seeking veterans is to connect with other professionals who might have advice or leads. “I would use LinkedIn to connect with everyone you served with,” advised Robert Martin. “Many [former] officers and senior enlisted men and women from the military get hired to consult on projects they worked on in the service. These people can provide the largest network of possible connections and career opportunities. They are also a great source for recommendations, which is very important to developing your LinkedIn profile.” You can also join LinkedIn groups, such as and , to find profiles of veterans who have made the transition to civilian careers. It’s also important to expand your connections beyond fellow veterans. “The worst thing you can do is stay insular when you are making this transition,” said Alexandra Levit, a career expert who has worked with veterans. “You should absolutely be meeting as many new people in as many new fields as you can.” One great way to expand your network is to join LinkedIn groups related to the industry you want to join. If you’re not sure of your direction, check out the top five industries for veterans on LinkedIn, where you might find that your skills and interests are a good match: In general, most veterans I spoke with characterized the transition from a military career to a civilian career as similar to any career change. You need to work hard to learn the language, customs and networks of your new industry, but once you’ve made the transition you’ll likely find that your different background is an asset. As Ray Luther remarked, “Many veterans live the values they inherited during their service for the rest of their lives.” In my experience, that’s an asset any organization would be honored to have.

Last week, three-time Pulitzer Prize winner and famed New York Times columnist came in to talk about his latest book “ .\" Tom’s latest book “That Used to Be Us” picks up where “The World is Flat” left off, as he turns his insights inward into how we can transform America and move past the economic downturn that’s roiling both America and the world at large today. Tom talked about how the world has rapidly evolved into a hyper-connected one in just the past few years thanks to the proliferation of information producers as well as the means to consume content via smart mobile devices. In order to individually succeed in today's world, he called out the need for each of us to have an internal OODA - Observe, Orient, Decide, Act - loop that is faster than that of our competition. He also stressed on the critical importance of realizing that “average is over”; and, also that the economy of the future will reward individuals who deliver “extra” in their roles and “invent, re-invent, and re-re-invent” the way they drive value out of their jobs. Finally, Tom spent time enumerating the challenges we face as a country in this new world and how we could overcome them. My core takeaway from his talk was a comforting one; that citizens and professionals in a country have a strong role to play in deciding whether or not we reassert a nation’s leadership and progress. As he said, it is up to us to decide if our “future is all used up”. So, what are the core values that are going to get our country moving along the right direction, again? At an individual level, Tom stressed on the need to prioritize spending our dollars on education over infrastructure. Making education out of reach to most Americans, at a time when some of our strongest competitors are increasing their investment in education, would sound a death knell to progress. On the other hand, Tom also suggested if we believe that our ecosystem (government-sponsored research, a competitive immigration policy, etc.) is exceptional, we need to preserve that at a higher priority than education. Lest we forget, the omnipresent Internet was the fruit of government sponsored research; and, several of today’s industrial giants would not exist without the efforts and dynamism of our forebears coming from different parts of the world. Tom’s talk inspired me to spend the time to understand the core issues behind the challenges we face, and to participate in overcoming them by sharing my thoughts with our local Congressional leaders. I believe it will take reflection and participation from the entire country to identify what we each personally think makes America what it is today and what trade-offs we as individuals are willing to make to ensure it stays that way."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Tips","Company Pages","Infographic"],"author":"Mike Grishaver","title":"Company Status: Five Tips to Engage Your Followers","date":"October 31, 2011","content":"By now, you’ve heard about LinkedIn’s , an exciting new feature that allows companies to engage directly with their LinkedIn Followers.

Given that we totally re-imagined the design of our app, we thought it would be interesting to look back and share some of the thinking that shaped the final product. Though the legacy design provided much utility over it’s lifetime, a close look at usage metrics, our roadmap, and input from users told us we needed to do more to improve the app’s efficiency and ability to support new features such as Groups. This was a real opportunity to streamline the user experience and elevate high-value content, while laying a stable foundation for future updates. We also wanted to introduce some personality to the app, and create something as beautiful to view, as it was delightful to use. The 3 x 3 icon dashboard can be a great tool for navigating an app; however, that’s where it’s utility ends. In the new app, we present relevant content up-front and instantly notify users of new invitations and messages. In other words, we remove the friction of a dashboard and provide immediate value on app launch. Throughout the app, we eliminated the use of unnecessary tab bars, tool bars, and other interface cruft. The idea being we surface more signal and suppress the clutter. We also wanted to create a holistic design language that could be employed consistently throughout the app. With these goals in mind, we standardized a concise set of design patterns and greatly simplified the user interface (UI) in order to bring critical functionality and useful content to the forefront. For example, in the old app, tab bars provided marginal functionality that few people actually utilized, and they occupied a significant chunk of screen real estate. It was apparent that people were using tabs to find more relevant content. So, with the introduction of “roll-ups” – where we aggregate new connections and profile updates – quality content and insights rise to the surface. This allowed us to eliminate the tab bar and give users more screen area to consume their stream. It was important to us that we pay attention to the details. From the color value of the leather grain to the highlights on the typography, we were meticulous about the design minutiae. Visually, we wanted to introduce more richness and create a more striking, high-quality look. In fact, we dedicated 10 days and the collective power of 10 designers to brainstorm and explore visual fit and finish. During the exercise, we found we could get considerable mileage from the careful and detailed application of few elements such as color, texture, and typography. A lot of time and care went into editing, polishing and debating the sweet spot between tasteful and tacky, and we’re pretty happy with the results. [caption id=\"attachment_8006\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"540\"] Some of the visual design explorations we experimented[/caption] Overall, our team feels great about the redesign, but we know there is much more work to do. We now have a solid, scalable, and attractive foundation upon which we will continue to innovate, so please keep your comments and feedback coming. We’re just getting started."},{"post_categories":["Featured","Infographic"],"author":"Nicole Williams","title":"INFOGRAPHIC: Women and Mentoring in the U.S.","date":"October 25, 2011","content":"It may not surprise you, but LinkedIn’s latest study found (in a survey of nearly 1,000 female professionals in the U.S.) that 82 percent of women agree that having a mentor is important.  But what will knock your socks off is that considering the competitive employment landscape, and the universal belief that mentorship is a critical component to career success, 19 percent (that’s nearly one out of every five women) have NEVER had a mentor. Whether you are one of those people who have yet to take advantage of this career-advancing relationship or if you want to add another to your repertoire (yes, you can have more than one) here’s what you need to know. :  Start with the goal in mind. While typically referring to friendships, I find this is one of the most effective ways of wrapping your head around what you’re looking for in a mentor.  Before you can address the where and how of it all, it comes down to having a very clear view of what you’re looking for.  Whether it be the insight of an expert to help answer a specific question that’s haunting you, or finding someone you want to emulate for their poise and integrity; the better you’re able to define what you’re looking for, the more apt you are to find it. :  If there’s one piece of advice when it comes to finding a mentor it’s to think outside the box. We can easily get stuck thinking of mentorship as this formal, official way of relating to people in business; however, by narrowing our definition of who can help guide us in our careers, we can miss out on the potential mentors who are right under our noses (our neighbors, direct colleagues or even our relatives). More importantly, it ignores those we may have never met in our life but would be happy to answer a quick question if you make a common connection online. Try doing an on LinkedIn and look for a mentor by narrowing your search parameters.  For example, because you can use LinkedIn to search for professionals by their title and the university that they attended, you could search for the following professionals: \" \" and try to connect with people by mentioning your shared alma mater.  You can even so you can meet up with someone right in your own city.  :  You're not going to get anywhere if you're not willing to ask, \"Will you be my mentor?\"  In general, people, especially successful people, want to help others by sharing the knowledge they've gained.  While you don't have to pose the question quite so formally, you do need to ask it. Unless someone is actively seeking a mentee, you have to be proactive and set the grounds for a deeper relationship.  In fact, 67 percent of the women LinkedIn surveyed said they had never mentored another professional because, \"no one had ever asked.\"  And here’s the deal: When asking, don’t make it sound like a death sentence.  Mentorship is responsible work but if there isn’t a promise of fun, initiative or excitement on your part (which can literally be conveyed by having a smile on your face), don’t expect your would-be mentor to embrace the opportunity to help you. : While the purpose of having a mentor is to further your learning and career, don’t forget that mentorship is a two-way street.  You're going to get more out of your relationship with your mentor if you (a) don't expect them to do the heavy lifting for you, (b) you make it easy on them (think closer to her office than yours when meeting face-to-face and (c) they are receiving something in return for their help. Don't underestimate the effects of reciprocity. While you want your gift back to be as work-related as possible, you can make the gift as thoughtful as possible. For e.g. save your mentee time that she can spend on you. Whether it's taking care of her kids or organizing her closet, you need to show your mentor that you're grateful for their guidance — and, frankly,  actions speak louder than words. These are just a few tips I’ve gathered along my professional career that’s helped me build strong mentoring relationships.

LinkedIn offered all that to me when I joined, and it’s been true every day since. After working for several months in business development, I had the opportunity to work on a dream assignment: . My entire business development team was behind me while I transitioned to my new role, and the team that came together to launch Japan – from all functions in the company – inspired me every step of the way. [caption id=\"attachment_7960\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"522\"] Everyone from the company involved in the LinkedIn Japan launch[/caption] LinkedIn has a unique culture where big projects ripple across every facet of the organization. When LinkedIn started thinking about establishing a physical presence in Japan, I leapt at the opportunity to draw from my experience and contribute. Even better was the enthusiasm my colleagues showed for the task at hand: securing an office in Shibuya, building our site to support our Japanese users, managing a launch event from across an ocean, and working around the clock to accommodate deadlines and timezones. Now that we’ve launched LinkedIn in Japan; looking back, laughter and celebration is what I will take away from my weekly 4 am calls with my team at headquarters. Likewise, they were regularly emailing me at midnight, 1 am, and 2 am Pacific time with deliveries of their own, often so I could have something ready for my work day in Japan. My interest in Japanese culture began in my childhood. I grew up in Kentucky, where Japanese auto manufacturers had a big presence. This exposure led me to study Japanese in college, and then spend two years after graduation as an elementary school teacher in Tahara, Japan. That’s when I fell in love with Japan, and Japan has become the strongest thread in my career history. I’ve worked for and with tech companies in Japan for more than 10 years. I’ve since moved to Tokyo to build out our office and continue to grow our presence in Japan, and it’s truly a dream come true. – our awesome marketing lead in Tokyo – and I have a whiteboard and a window, and we are in daily touch with our team at home, working together to achieve all the goals we have for this year and beyond. We’re recruiting a strong leadership team in Japan to help us – ! And we feel lucky to be in this early stage environment together with the support of our brand and our company behind us. LinkedIn is unique. It’s a company that creates an environment in which employees can take responsibility and accept a challenge, knowing that the entire organization will step up to help.  And we have fun doing it – just look at the photos of the Japan team accompanying this story!

On October inDay, we did exactly that. LinkedIn employees contributed in two ways. First, as personal coaches, guiding the member with their particular job search challenges. Each member had a unique career twist. For example, we met Jane*, a highly qualified biomedical engineering graduate of Carnegie Mellon, who had been out of the workforce for 5 years due to personal circumstances.  Her skills are in demand, but recruiters don’t know what to make of the gap.  The coach was able to help with explaining and positioning that gap in her LinkedIn profile and highlight her recent professional activities. Second, experts from each product area operated workstations for ‘deep dives’ into specific topics:  job searching, positioning your profile, volunteering, networking and, of course, the crowd favorite, head shots for that profile picture. Both groups felt a hugely positive vibe. Members felt they were unlocking new doors to opportunity:  “I never thought about searching for people as part of my job search.”  Many were inspired by our CEO, question and answer session. These were a few reactions: “that was a highlight of the day” … “He gave very specific advice to members, that means a lot.”  They were also inspired to see the people behind the website:  “You guys really care about helping members be successful… it shows.” LinkedIn employees gained insights and felt great connecting with real members.  One coach felt that the LinkedIn attendees “radiated that ‘do good and feel good’ glow”. Head of Business Development, rated his experience at 3 exclamation marks:  “what a fantastic InDay project!!!”. , Senior Manager of Business Analytics, particularly enjoyed the opportunity to connect with the members one on one. “The job seekers who attended were very interested in learning how to use LinkedIn to get an extra advantage in this competitive job market.

It captured my imagination, because she was able to use crowdsourcing to directly deliver work to the poor and impact the world. So, I was thrilled to have Leila over at LinkedIn for the most recent edition of our Speaker Series. Samasource is an internet non-profit with the mission of alleviating poverty in developing countries by giving people the opportunity to do “microwork.” Applying Henry Ford’s assembly line thinking to the standard outsourcing model, Samasource takes large data projects from its clients and breaks them down to small discrete tasks that can be accomplished over the internet by thousands of workers in developing countries. Leila spoke of the similarity between “microwork” and Mohammed Yunus’ model of microfinance, which entails giving very small loans to the poor. Like Yunus’ work, which challenged prevalent assumptions that poor people were too irresponsible to be lent money, Leila’s work at Samasource challenges similarly incorrect assumptions: that poor people lack the skills to participate in the global economy, and even if they had these skills, there isn’t the infrastructure to employ them at scale. The Samasource platform, or “Samahub,” takes advantage of the internet, connecting hundreds of workers in India, Haiti, Kenya, Uganda and South Africa to work from companies in the US, allowing large-scale data projects to be completed with high quality. Leila told several stories of the ways Samasource has impacted her workers’ lives. For instance, with the wages, her workers are able to save for college tuition, support the members of their families, and gain a sense of participation in the global economy. Each task accomplished earns the worker a couple of cents, which adds up to several dollars a day. While this may not seem like much, this is a substantial increase in quality of living for her workers, who previously lived on less than three dollars per day. After working for Samasource, workers have a proven job record, work experience, and relevant skills. Rather than giving charity, Samasource provides a meaningful solution to poverty by giving poor people the ability to provide for themselves, and a future. Additionally, Samasource consistently performs better than typical outsourcing firms, making a company or team’s decision to use Samasource not only an act of support for poor people in developing countries, but also a smart business decision. Since LinkedIn encourages every employee to volunteer one day a month (\"InDay\") to help good causes, I'd decided to use my InDay time to help Samasource. As I looked for the most effective way to help them, I discovered , an organization that pairs professionals and students to work on international development projects.  Through DSO, I guided and mentored students to do substantial work on our first project with Samasource, the creation of a video transcription module that would allow workers in developing countries to take in video and transcribe it to text. Ever since I started volunteering for Samasource, I’ve been struck by the similarity in Samasource’s and LinkedIn’s missions. Samasource uses technology and the internet to connect people in developing countries with opportunities to do non-menial work, allowing them to be employed en-masse in the execution of large data projects. LinkedIn uses technology and the internet to connect professionals and students all around the globe to opportunities, and to each other. As an employee of LinkedIn, I am proud to serve this mission, and to be part of an organization that encourages me to volunteer my professional skills to help Samasource in a meaningful way."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News"],"author":"Daniel Roth","title":"The King of Freemium and other Top Stories of the Week.

Fast Company’s lays out the coming battles between , , and , and explains why so many of the decisions they make today are in preparation for the future fights. Pleasing the consumer or Wall Street comes second, he argues, to keeping the competition off kilter: When Google invests billions to build smartphones and a new social network, is it really trying to topple Apple and Facebook—or is it simply building a wider moat to protect its core interest, search revenue? … These ventures are decoy threats that tax a rival's resources.

Houston cruises through the Valley in a Zipcar, spurning Apple and sharing bison with Mark Zuckerberg as he grows his cloud-storage company. His secret is a single-minded focus on a single product, and a mastery of the freemium business model. Houston’s got 50 million users, an expected $240 million in revenue in 2011, and only 70 engineers. Only 4% of people currently pay a penny, but: [T]housands of people each day blow through the free 2 gigabytes of storage, and upgrade to 50 gigs for $10 a month or 100 gigs for $20. Even if Houston doesn’t sign up a single customer in 2012, his sales will double. It’s no surprise that the story had such a powerful impact with business people. Who wouldn’t want to have that kind of math at play in their company or in the economy in general? Here are some top stories shared by professionals in the following industries. Finally, I wanted to go back to a poll we launched last month and look at its findings: We asked members to tell us where they thought the unemployment rate would be this time next year. Nearly 1,500 people voted. LinkedIn polls head dug through the numbers to pull out some insights. The most interesting: Owners of companies —the ones doing the hiring—were less confident about the direction of the economy.  By a 22% rate vs 17% for the overall population, they said that unemployment would likely be above 10.5% next year. And that dark sense carried through the entire poll. Overall, owners, CEOs, and VPs were more likely to be pessimistic than managers and individual contributors.

Developers have to rely on aggressive caching which creates its own set of problems. In his talk, Prof Ousterhout talked about an entirely new approach of dealing with this problem i.e. shift the focus on online data storage from disk to DRAM. While DRAM is still more expensive than disk, for lot of online data, DRAM is cheap enough that most of online data can now fit in RAM. RAMCloud is a new general purpose storage system being developed at Stanford that keeps all data in DRAM and uses disk only for backup. It is built to scale to 1000+ servers holding 100+ TB data. While each DRAM based server is able to deliver much higher throughput than a disk based one, the biggest impact comes from the latency which is many orders of magnitude lower. For web applications, this translates into ability to perform many more lookups per page, which means richer user experience. During rest of his talk, Prof. Ousterhout explained how crash recovery is done in RAMCloud which has some very innovative ways of speeding up recovery while keeping the memory footprint as low as possible.

The first telethon consisted of 15 members of our sales force calling 750 previous donors to see if they would consider reactivating their support. To keep it simple, when the team got someone live that was interested we simply forwarded the call to the Plan Ireland office or marked the contact for follow up. Our team’s efforts not only helped Plan Ireland update their records but these calls also had an important ‘hello’ factor in that those called reminded, and thanked donors for their previous support to Plan Ireland, thus reinforcing potential donor loyalty into the future. Most importantly, the funds raised within one hour of calling over €20,000, the equivalent of building three schools in a developing country. Our second telethon campaign was even more well received as we called existing donors that simply needed to fill in a tax form and send it in for Plan Ireland to claim a rebate from the Irish Revenue Commissioner. 16 people flew through these calls netting an estimated €24,000 that will be used to support Plan Ireland’s food and water crisis response in East Africa by feeding 800 Ethiopian families for three months.

We look forward to partnering with them throughout the year and hope to replicate this program again. If  we could complete 6 sessions in a year, we can potentially bring in over €140k. With this in mind the bar is being raised as we set a target of €200k for ourselves. Let me leave you with some thoughts from , Plan Ireland’s CEO: Our relationship with Linkedin over the last few months has been vitally important to us. Outside of the obvious monetary value, the enthusiasm and energy from everyone involved the Calling for a Cause campaign has been so encouraging. I look forward to continuing our relationship well into the future and, on behalf of all the children we represent, I thank all involved."},{"post_categories":["Groups","Engineering"],"author":"John Kristian","title":"Behind the Scenes: Engineering LinkedIn Groups","date":"October 18, 2011","content":" There are over 1 million on LinkedIn and millions of members join these groups every week. When working with this volume of data, we ran into an interesting problem: how can we rank group discussions so that the most \"interesting\" ones appear at the top? What algorithm could handle the huge stream of activity - new discussions, comments, likes, views, follows and shares - to produce an order that would work for active and inactive groups as well as for active and inactive members? We knew discussions with more recent activity should rank higher, so we wanted velocity in the formula. Our first attempt was to use . Take a look at the chart below: the blue and red lines represent two separate discussions. Each spike represents an \"action\" in the discussion, such as a comment or a like: [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"400\" caption=\"Using exponential moving averages to rank discussions\"] [/caption]  As time goes on, the score of each discussion decays. However, more recent actions get a higher score than actions in the past, so the red discussion gets a higher final score. It's something like velocity, and it also remembers old activity. Unfortunately, this approach doesn't scale. Since scores should decay over time, you'd need to update the scores on either (a) on a periodic basis, such as every 5 minutes or (b) every time an action is taken on discussion, you update all other discussions in that group. Option (a) results in a sub-optimal user experience, as stale discussions stay near the top while the updating code runs. Option (b) requires lots of (costly) synchronization as simultaneous actions compete with each other to update the same discussions. Either way, you'd need to constantly update a huge amount of data, which places a large, unnecessary, and, worst of all, ever-growing write load on our systems. Instead of decaying the scores of past actions, we decided to give more weight to current actions. For the same two discussions and four actions discussed above, the scores become: [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"400\" caption=\"Give more weight to recent actions\"] [/caption]  A discussion's score doesn't decay with time; it remains constant when there's no activity. When an action occurs, you update the score of just one discussion, and then rank it compared to the old, unchanged scores of its competitors. The ranking comes out the same as with moving averages, and since far fewer writes are required, the algorithm is more scalable. Unfortunately, now we have a different problem: the numbers get really big. As time goes by, the weight of a new action increases . For example, if the weight doubles daily, an event that scores 1 today would score 128 a week from now, 16,384 two weeks from now, about 1,000,000,000 a month from now and about 7.5 x 10 a year from now. Floating point arithmetic helps, but it runs out of gas eventually. We figured scores would overflow a Java double in about nine months, and overflow a number in our Oracle database about three months later. Although we could code our way around the Java limitation, the database limitation looked harder. If in ~12 months we were forced to change the storage system, we'd have to convert all existing scores while simultaneously processing new ones, and all without downtime (we don't shut down for maintenance, as a rule). We needed to get this one right from the start. We thought about storing the printable form of numbers as strings in the database. Using scientific notation, we'd have plenty of room to grow. But we couldn't use the database to find, say, the top ten scores in a group. The database would sort the strings alphabetically, not numerically, so we'd get wrong answers like 10 < 2 (because the string \"10\" comes before \"2\" alphabetically). Was there a string format that would sort like the numbers, the same way UTF-8 byte strings sort the same as the characters they represent? It was time to get help. We used our LinkedIn connections to get introductions to mathematicians and posted our question in LinkedIn groups devoted to . This sparked some creative thinking and lively discussions. In no time, somebody casually mentioned that some universal codes are lexically ordered. We could store a number in binary floating point, with the of the exponent followed by the fractional part of the significand. For example, here is how we would encode the number 14.25:   You can see the gritty details and the code . Our web servers send a stream of actions to a \"scoring service\" that updates scores and rankings in the database. Scores are stored as encoded strings, which are sorted to get the rankings. When a web server needs to show a summary, it calls the \"groups service\", which uses the cached ranking to put together the list of discussions. If the ranking isn't in the cache, the group service queries it from the database and caches it. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"400\" caption=\"Ranking architecture\"] [/caption]  We launched this system using Java double for calculating scores. Six months later, we went back and replaced Java double with , an awesome implementation of big numbers. Today, the scoring service runs on a small cluster of 4 servers: at peak, we process 500 actions per second while utilizing less than 30% of the CPU. Here's some sample data from the database: In decimal notation, those values are approximately: We changed the scoring formula a few times: The ranking works pretty well. We know the system encourages members to visit their groups more frequently. As usual, we'll run with it until we think of something better  and would love to hear your feedback in the meanwhile!"},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn for Students","New LinkedIn Features"],"author":"Christina Allen","title":"LinkedIn Classmates: Explore possibilities by connecting with fellow alumni","date":"October 19, 2011","content":"What’s the most valuable outcome of your college years?  If you think it’s your degree, you’re only partially right.  Beyond the knowledge you gained in school, your alumni network is one of the most important benefits you earned.  In the years since college, your classmates have become experienced professionals, industry experts, potential clients and trusted colleagues - in short, people who can help you expand your horizons.

Whether it be the empty coffee pot or the gum-smacking intern, the laundry list of office pet peeves is getting longer and longer with people not taking ownership for their actions having the distinction of hitting the number one spot in LinkedIn’s global survey of most irritating office pet peeves. More pet peeves and tips to overcome them after the infographic. Asking over 17,000 professionals ‘what’s your pet peeve,’ the Negative Nelly’s of the world came in second, leaving your lunch in the fridge or microwave long past expiration is third, followed by those snoozer meetings. Rounding out the top five, those people who consistently seem to miss your email (you can only use the \"it hit my Spam\" excuse so many times).And the peeves are not exclusive to the United States. Turns out professionals are peeved the world over.  Office pranks rank highest in Japan, with Brazil getting most peeved by excessive gossiping.   You’ll want to turn down your mobile ringer when working in India and apparently you can get away with a higher hem in Sweden.  While seemingly harmless, the reality of one-too-many peeves in the workplace is a lack of productivity and this you need to take seriously in the face of a highly competitive job market. There are a couple of things you need to consider when tackling the peeve: :  It’s not a necessarily fun or easy conversation to suggest to a co-worker that perhaps she could tone it down on the perfume, but the secret here is the earlier the better and whenever possible do it in the moment (hey, do you mind refilling the photocopier with paper…before she’s walked away).  One of the biggest mistakes you can make is to let an irritation grow into full-fledged agitation and when you finally hit the breaking point, flip your lid in an embarrassing display of disproportionate emotion.   This needs to be a calm conversation, preferably with a solid example of the behavior that’s driving you crazy. :  While peeves can feel petty, your response needs to be anything but.  Ideally you want to focus on the behavior and address it in relation to how it’s affecting your performance.   No name calling.  No you answered your phone in my meeting, I’m bringing my computer to yours.  No I’m telling the boss before you’ve had your own tête-à-tête. :  Who knew there was a such a thing as typing too hard?  Lots of people.  In the vast majority of cases the person who is peeving you has no idea the degree to which they are driving you around the bend and if they did, they’d be glad to eat their stinky lunch in the break room instead of at their desk. :  Which leads us to the very delicate question: could you be a peever? With all this cubicle discord going on, you’re sure to be doing something that isn’t sitting pretty with someone in your office.  Re-read LinkedIn’s list of top peeves and ask yourself how many times you’ve left your dishes in the sink this month.   If you’re not sure, feel free to very delicately ask a trusted colleague for input… just don’t start to gossip about her if you don’t like what you hear.

Over the years, I've shipped many products, worked under some amazing leaders, and as a leader myself, written hundreds of performance reviews. During all this time, I've learned that great engineering leaders aren’t born; they are made. Or, to be more accurate, they seem to evolve, one step at a time, through four focus areas: technology, process, product and people. Most engineering leaders start here. Promoted recently from engineering, they typically focus on technology problem solving; after all, that's what made them successful in the first place. Java or C++? MySQL or NoSQL? Threaded or evented? They tend to focus the organization around themselves and are central to every project.  While this makes them an indispensable individual contributor, they don't fully leverage their people and scale their organization. After seeing their team suffer and miss commitments, many engineering leaders begin to appreciate how the application of well defined software development processes can help to improve transparency, coordination, and early discovery and resolution of issues. Keywords like agile, waterfall, extreme programming, six sigma, and scrum start flying around. Teams who embrace new practices sometimes outshine and outproduce others. But sometimes, too much focus on process can result in a leader alienating his team; don't forget the cover on your TPS report. The rare engineering manager will start to focus not only on something gets built and shipped, but also on is being shipped. Having a deep product understanding is an important trait in a good engineering leader. However, everybody has an opinion and many engineers fall into the trap of designing solutions in an inside-out manner. Better solutions result from listening to stakeholders through Sales, Business Development, Product Managers and Designers.  Better yet, engineering leaders and their team should get out into the field to spend time directly with customers. The most experienced engineering managers know it’s all about the people. Unfortunately, many managers make the mistake of confusing the goal of “everybody is working effectively” with “everybody likes me”. Being buddies with your co-workers is great, but not enough to be an effective engineering leader. The best leaders manage to strike a delicate balance between technology, process, product and people. They teach best practices, remove impediments, and get out of the way. They focus on . They know that if you hire the right people and put those people in the right positions, they will figure out the right technology and process to get the job done. They have a , and create an environment where engineers have autonomy, mastery, and purpose. LinkedIn prizes highly technical leaders at all engineering levels from manager to vice president and I feel fortunate to be a part of a leadership team that balances all four focus areas. I get the chance to work on advancing our technology (designing active serving from multiple data centers, decoupling services, refactoring key systems, and implementing new frameworks and platforms), optimizing our processes (testing practices, code reviews, agile practices, streamlined release to production), and improving my product knowledge (we're starting \"follow me home\" customer visits to keep our engineers attuned to how customers are using our products, and understand their unmet needs). In addition, we get to set up our people for success (improving hiring practices, implementing a technical career ladder, expanding development centers around the world, organizing team learning). And we’re hiring. LinkedIn is looking for software engineering leaders in multiple areas from evolving paid services, to mobile and platform APIs for third-party developers."},{"post_categories":["New LinkedIn Features","Company Pages"],"author":"Ryan Roslansky","title":"New Company Updates: Learn more about the Companies you follow on LinkedIn","date":"October 6, 2011","content":"We are excited to announce LinkedIn’s new company status updates, that will now let members receive further insights -- breaking news about the company, employee moves, relevant job opportunities or the latest on their products and services including multimedia content -- directly from the companies they follow. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMknZutnVWE&fmt=22] Since our , nearly a year and a half ago, we’ve had over tens of millions of professionals follow over 2 million companies on LinkedIn.

Most recently, I even designed a line of jewelry for a fashion show that donated all proceeds to an building new lives for survivors of human trafficking. Yet realistically, I hadn’t considered making a career out of any of it – honestly, I hadn’t considered a “career” period.

Everyone was so considerate, and people really took an interest in me. A couple months in, the head of User Experience Design (UED) stopped by my desk and through our conversation, discovered I was studying graphic design. He, along with the other team members, encouraged me to dream big – to turn my passion into a career. He even met with me to give feedback as I built my portfolio. To my surprise, this past summer, they created an internship for me in their department which is rare since most other interns were engineers. Not only did I get to take part in fun intern events like attending a Giants game and sushi making class, but I also got to bring my talents to life. The UED team invested in me, mentored me, and from the beginning, trusted me with important projects (though one of my favorites had to be designing our Intern Fair t-shirts).

Standing under a balloon archway entrance, I loved seeing the surprised looks on employees’ faces as I welcomed them with a map of 30+ participating companies and organizations. This was no ordinary health fair. Not only did employees engage with a variety of insurance providers, but they also participated in fitness challenges, had their caricatures drawn and relaxed for massages under shady tents.

Finally, an overview of the PEGASUS system which is designed to handle billion-node graphs using Hadoop. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBzoNgqF-gQ&fmt=22] Algorithmically matching items to users in a given context is essential for the success and profitability of large scale recommender systems like content optimization, computational advertising, search, shopping, movie recommendation, and many more. In this talk, Deepak discusses some of the key technical challenges by focusing on a concrete application - content optimization on the Yahoo! front page. He also briefly discusses response prediction techniques for serving ads on the RightMedia Ad exchange. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzOBGLCRbc&fmt=22] My colleague, Jay Kreps, discusses the state of up-and-coming stream processing technologies and how they fit in the broader data infrastructure ecosystem -- from live storage systems to Hadoop. He explores problems that are amenable to real-time stream processing, solutions that change and shape the way we think about data, and challenges and lessons that we have learned while building LinkedIn’s data infrastructure. A must-see presentation. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlX3IHb0JE&fmt=22] In addition to providing compelling speakers, Open Tech Talks offer attendees a low-pressure environment in which people with shared professional interests can reconnect with people they know, as well as make new connections.

Plus the 4 other Top Stories on LinkedIn","date":"September 2, 2011","content":"After weeks of market and big tech turmoil (Apple bidding farewell to its leader, HP doing the same to its tablet), professionals across LinkedIn took a break from breaking news to focus on themselves. They had heavy questions, like “Why doesn’t anyone share what I write?” and “Why aren’t I better at sales?” Let’s tackle the last question first. The biggest problem with your sales strategy is that you have the wrong DNA, says a blogger at the Harvard Business Review. According to Steve W. Martin, an adjunct professor at USC’s Marshall School of Business, . “The overwhelming majority of top salespeople are gifted with innate talents,” he writes. Self-taught salespeople have an uphill battle: For every 100 people who enter sales without natural sales traits, 40% will fail or quit, 40% will perform at near average, and only 20% will be above average. Martin offers some tips, such as learning from past mistakes, but he says there's no skirting his findings. Unless you were closing deals in your diapers, your chances of success are limited. So if sales is out, maybe social media is the way to go. Write some articles, post some videos and watch the sharing world turn you and your product viral. Well, you’re probably doing that wrong, too, according to Social Media Examiner. : You’re boring, you're untrustworthy, you don’t listen, and you’re not as cool as you think you are (unless you’re a cause, in which case you cool). A three-day weekend couldn’t come soon enough! But wait, there is a ray of hope. The top shared story this week was a looking at the rise of social networks in recruiting. Nearly 90% of surveyed companies say they plan to use LinkedIn and other social platforms to recruit this year and 65% have successfully hired using a social network. So if sales and social networking aren’t in your blood, at least you can keep an up-to-date profile and work to find an employer who will appreciate your true talent. :"},{"post_categories":["Profile","Featured","LinkedIn Tips","New LinkedIn Features","LinkedIn for Good"],"author":"Nicole Williams","title":"Why Volunteering is Good for Your Career","date":"September 7, 2011","content":"Millions of professionals donate their time volunteering that impacts the lives of others, but it turns out volunteering is as good for your career as it is to those you help. Here’s how: – All that time you spent raising record amounts of money, the year-end event you planned to perfection all felt like real work and…it was. New research from LinkedIn shows that one out of every five hiring managers in the U.S. agree they have hired a candidate because of their volunteer work experience. Your volunteer experience counts and if you don’t include it in your profile, on your resume or when you’re negotiating for a promotion you’re not getting the credit you deserve. – A truism of career success is that passion correlates with talent and talent translates to reward (both financial and emotional).  One of the safest ways of test-driving your passion as a career is to volunteer your talents.  Not only do you get to try your hand at a repertoire of new skills and experiences in a low-risk forum, but you’ll also be showcasing these talents to a whole host of who may just happen to have the connections you need to get hired. t – The majority of career enhancing opportunities come through relationships and volunteering exposes you to people you wouldn’t encounter otherwise.  And get this: volunteer relationships are particularly beneficial since many of the folks you interact with while volunteering are usually driven, conscientious professionals who can be a great referral. Volunteering offers a whole new world of qualified and valuable connections. The most successful people in the world dedicate their efforts to a cause that extends beyond themselves and your boss and / or hiring manager are well aware of this. In this hypercompetitive world of work, volunteering not only provides you the opportunity to showcase your talents and experiences, but it also allows you to demonstrate compassion and commitment.

Unemployment is at 9.1%. However, that number only scratches the surface of the magnitude of the problem. There are over 25 million Americans unemployed, underemployed or only marginally attached to the workforce. Factor in the average size of a U.S. household and that's as many as 20% of Americans whose lives are being dramatically impacted by this stagnation. Yet there's another massive labor imbalance in the country that rarely gets attention. According to the most recent report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are over three million job opportunities going unfilled in the U.S. right now, the highest level in three years. How is that possible? Simply put, companies can find workers; they just can't find the right workers. The CEO of Siemens' ( ) U.S. subsidiary says that . Everyone from industry giants like Microsoft ( ) to small- and medium-sized businesses like Begal Enterprises, a disaster-cleanup company in Maryland, are . Fixing this imbalance and matching job openings with willing talent will go a long way toward restarting a virtuous economic cycle: when companies expand, they pay more taxes, consume more services (enabling other companies to expand) and open up opportunities for others to be promoted or hired. So how do we do it? Here are three proposed solutions: • . The technology revolution has upended industries and career paths at an unprecedented pace. Economic transitions that once took centuries (think agrarian to industrial) or decades (think industrial to information), are now taking place over only a handful of years. Classic economic theory would suggest that when Amazon ( ) overturns Borders or Netflix ( ) sinks Blockbuster, productivity gains manifested by these next generation companies should enable the displaced employees to find work elsewhere and add incremental economic value to the system. That's clearly not happening. We need to make the pace of technological change work to fix the same problem that it helped create. This will come through the development of an economic graph. Most of us are by now familiar with the value generated by the social graph concept popularized by Facebook, the professional graph developed by LinkedIn ( ), and the interest graph implicitly manifested by Twitter. What if we were able to extend that thinking to the economy itself and developed an economic graph? Imagine a world in which every job opportunity, full-time and temporary, was digitally searchable and linked to the appropriate company and skills required to obtain the position. Now imagine if the 153 million people in the U.S. workforce -- or 3.3 billion people in the global workforce -- had a digital profile, highlighting their experiences, skills and, most importantly, their ambitions. Each of those individuals would be empowered to develop their professional identities, networks and knowledge and subsequently not just find jobs, but also map and fulfill their ideal career paths. Qualified candidates could easily ask their connections about existing opportunities, apply for those jobs at the click of a button, and request introductions so they'd never go into a potential employer cold. Graduating students could instantly find appropriate mentors. Employers could fill critical open jobs by searching across a rich set of highly relevant facets in order to find the ideal candidates. Economists could generate insights leading to improved predictive analysis of where future jobs will be, and in turn, today's educators could leverage that information to prevent the creation of future skills imbalances. • . There are highly skilled individuals working outside the U.S. who are capable of filling today's vacant, yet critical jobs -- jobs that may be at risk of being shipped overseas. Yet these people can't work in the U.S. because of limitations on the number of available H1-B visas. Opening the doors to such professionals would not only increase the productivity of their new employers, but fuel job creation domestically as these same individuals earn wages that will be spent in the U.S. economy. Additionally, these talented engineers, scientists and other highly skilled workers are the same people capable of starting companies that generate exponentially more economic opportunities for others. • . Today, we train students for the jobs of yesterday, not the jobs of today or, more importantly, the jobs of tomorrow. We need to harness the data available through digital platforms to create just-in-time professional training programs based on current and future job availabilities. In addition to traditional vocational classrooms, that training can take place at universities, community colleges or within companies themselves. One powerful and often overlooked tool is the internship. At LinkedIn, we've established , which seeks to close the opportunity divide by providing internships to young adults in low-income communities. We've also built a successful paid summer internship program for students, providing them with hands-on experience in key positions for the company. However, for smaller businesses that can't afford to train uninitiated talent and pay them at the same time, these potential learning opportunities are squandered. We need to provide these companies the right incentives to . Investing in these initiatives will help fill the millions of open jobs in this country. It will also foster new growth and create new opportunities, helping to solve our broader unemployment crisis. But more is needed to make sure the skills gap doesn't widen again. Most importantly, we must completely overhaul our educational system. We can start by transforming our schools from places where antiquated rote learning techniques are taught into one where the building blocks for real-world job skills are prized. That means fostering capabilities such as critical reasoning, collaboration and creative problem solving. To build this new system, we need to recruit and develop teachers — and we need to do that at massive scale. The California Department of Education, for one, estimates that 97,000 teachers -- 32% of its teaching ranks -- will retire over the next 10 years. Similar teacher shortages exist elsewhere. Building the next generation of educators starts now. Finally, we can speed the build-out of a cutting-edge, national mobile and broadband infrastructure, ensuring that every American has access to the right information and knowledge, and can ultimately pursue their ideal career path. We have everything we need to bridge the gap between talent and opportunity. The solutions are within our grasp, but there is much work to be done. Our outdated analog approaches to preparing the workforce for the jobs of the 21st century led us into this crisis. New digital technology and creative approaches will lead us out of it. Now is the time."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News","Infographic"],"author":"Daniel Roth","title":"High weirdness in Silicon Valley: The Top Stories on LinkedIn (9/2-9/8)","date":"September 9, 2011","content":"It was a short week, but long on Techland drama. As startup advisor and former Yahoo’er   : “Bartz out at Yahoo! Arrington gives ultimatum to AOL. Google bids for Hulu. More buttered popcorn, please.” Not surprisingly, Silicon Valley headlines dominated sharing this week on LinkedIn. What was odd, however, was stories were being shared. Neither of the big breaking news items — that Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz had been fired or that TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington had been possibly axed (the story keeps changing) from AOL — made it to the top. Instead, professionals wanted to talk about the next moves for each company. The top Day 2 story came from , editor of Business Insider, who said that the Yahoo board was now looking for strategic buyers. Blodget called it effectively, “sticking a FOR SALE sign on the lawn.” One Yahoo rival particularly enjoyed the article: Microsoft, which had bid $46 billion, or $33 per share, for the company in 2008. Yahoo rejected the offer as too low. Now, with Yahoo stock at $14.50, . As Bing test manager put it, “Wow, Guess they would that MS offer now.” The No. 2 Day 2 article was TechCrunch writer ’s piece “TechCrunch as We Know it May Be Over.” Siegler declared his allegiance to Arrington on Sept. 6 when it was still unclear whether Arrington had been fired from AOL or just moved to the venture investing arm of the company. At issue was a fund Arrington had set up — the CrunchFund — that would invest in startups, the same companies TechCrunch covered. AOL management wasn’t sure whether it was backing Arrington or enraged with him. By May 7, Fortune’s Dan Primack was Arrington out. So why all the follow-up stories being shared at the expense of the breaking news? Maybe because both items seemed inevitable for so long. Ever since AOL bought TechCrunch in 2010, news watchers have been for an Arrington/AOL explosion; and since shortly after Bartz came on, questions about her management style and the company’s flagging stock have . The next steps for AOL and Yahoo was — and remains – the real mystery. Here’s a few headlines that were widely shared by professionals in these industries: Finally, we’re ending this week's post with a poll linked to the No. 3 most-shared story. Mashable looked at 9 Internet brands and asked how each came up with its name.

Here’s our question: which of these 5 companies most nailed it when it came to picking a moniker?"},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News"],"author":"Daniel Roth","title":"The Socializing of Business: The Top Stories on LinkedIn (9/9-9/15)","date":"September 16, 2011","content":"There was a time when social actions —connecting, liking, sharing and more —were considered the kind of cute things college kids and twentysomethings did to pass their idle time. Then social became a Silicon Valley fad and the use of the terms and the actions grew. Now, as the most-shared stories on LinkedIn this week point out, those signals have now weaved their way into the fabric of business. And they’re altering long- and even recently-held truths. Fast Company, which commands the No. 2 spot, reveals how IBM . As Big Blue defines it, social business involves taking the corporate voice and atomizing it. Instead of the c-suite crafting messages and sprinkling them on the masses, IBM staffers are becoming individual messengers, sharing and connecting with their enterprise customers. That means turning the legions of consultants into “experts,” whose messages are shared everywhere. The transition hasn’t been easy. IBM’s approach has been to be nimble, correct mistakes fast, and deliver change in small increments. Former IBM CEO Lou Gerstner once likened getting IBM to shift as being like teaching an elephant to dance. Fast Company guest blogger Drew Neisser says getting IBM to embrace social has been more like eating an elephant: best done “one bite at a time.” Even those companies who aren’t handing megaphones to their workers are being forced to rethink what it means to talk to customers. As points out, “51% of consumers said they are more likely to buy a product since becoming a fan on Facebook.” That’s a powerful incentive to collect fans; easier said than done. The old marketing messages don’t work. Today’s formula involves three steps that don’t come naturally to many brands: “Share compelling content, minimize marketing messages and refrain from overwhelming readers with too frequent updates.” And social signals are changing how business gets discovered. Contently co-founder Shane Snow, , details how search engines are increasingly paying attention to liking, following an +1’ing as they rank sites. Brands that link-purchased their way to top spots on Google or used mass-produced content to trick the algorithms now find themselves slipping out of site. Says Danny Sullivan, editor in chief of Search Engine Land: The links that you build through social media, the references, the authority — all can have an impact in various ways on how you are ranked and listed even in ‘regular’ search results. Social media allows for people to provide more trusted signals. No wonder that the No. 1 and No. 5 stories are about how to measure and how to avoid mistakes in social, whether by using or by keeping a . Social is now serious business. Other top-shared stories by professionals in these industries: This week’s poll will hopefully straighten out some confusion from Mashable’s Facebook study story. The piece points out that 76% of consumers have never “unliked” a brand – the opposite finding of a January study that said 81% of consumers have unliked a brand or hidden its content.  So which is it?

There are pros and cons to every situation, of course, and many people prefer to earn a living without a full-time, steady job. But there’s one area where “non-traditional” employment can pose a particular challenge: when creating a professional social media profile. Here are three common non-traditional employment scenarios and recommendations for how to portray them in the most positive way on LinkedIn. As you’ll see, in most cases you have several options depending on your unique circumstances and preferences: Whether you’re moonlighting outside of work hours, juggling two part-time jobs or developing two completely different careers at the same time (e.g., you’re an accountant who also teaches yoga), it can be challenging to design a profile that includes both situations. Your first decision is whether you want to feature both careers on your LinkedIn profile. If you think it might be puzzling or even damaging to one of your jobs to feature both on your profile, then simply leave off your other employment. There is no rule that you have to show you do on LinkedIn. If, on the other hand, you want to promote both of your jobs or careers, here are two ways to do that effectively: You’ll also want to list both of these positions as your Current Employment in your profile. The way to include more than one job as current is to put the end dates of both jobs as “present.” Note that whichever role began more recently will be displayed first. You can then mention your other work in your Summary statement. For example: “John has been working for the past seven years as a public relations executive in the pharmaceutical industry, where he has served such clients as X, Y and Z. In addition to his passion for PR, John is also an avid sailor and teaches private and small group sailing lessons as well (for more information, visit www.JohnTeachesSailing.com).  If you’re currently a business owner, consultant or freelancer but want to transition to full-time employment, your best bet is to indicate this clearly on your LinkedIn profile. If you don’t, most people will assume that you’re happy in your self-employment. Here are some ways to explain your goal: Whether you were out of the workforce raising children, caring for a sick relative, traveling, unemployed or otherwise engaged, a big gap in your LinkedIn profile might raise a red flag with employers so you need to address it directly. Again, you have several options: In general, be honest, be positive and be proactive about explaining your current situation and/or what situation you desire in the future. Then test your LinkedIn profile with a few trusted professionals to make sure it reads well and portrays you in the very best light. Good luck!"},{"post_categories":["Infographic"],"author":"Monica Rogati","title":"Sequencing the Startup DNA on LinkedIn","date":"September 1, 2011","content":"What makes entrepreneurs different, and where do they come from? Are they born or taught? Are they unusually mobile in their careers? Does geography play a role? Do mentors and relationships matter? Numerous studies explore these questions by surveying hundreds of entrepreneurs. At LinkedIn, we take a different approach, on a different scale. By sifting through more than 120 million public profiles, we can analyze tens of thousands of startup founders' profiles - and find common threads linking their careers. Our infographic above shows the top over-represented business schools among entrepreneurs - with Stanford, Harvard and MIT Sloan taking the top spots. If that doesn’t come as a surprise to you, take a look at the distribution of the founders’ age at their first startup. While young (and serial) entrepreneurs are often in the spotlight, our data shows that 65% of entrepreneurs are 30 and older - and only 2% are serial entrepreneurs. The value of a formal education for startup founders is a hotly debated subject. Let’s take a look at the data - in particular, the fields of study that entrepreneurs chose in college. Technical majors (except civil engineering) are over-represented among founders; nursing and administration are under-represented. While computer engineers find it easier to start companies in their areas of expertise, civil engineers and nurses need more infrastructure support. Some companies are breeding grounds for entrepreneurs - they’re more likely to appear on founders’ profiles than others. They include tech-heavy companies like , , (including Paypal, of the fame), , , , and among others. Are some industries harder to break into than others? Yes, according to our data: founders of semiconductor and pharmaceutical startups usually have previous industry experience, while founders of retail, consumer goods, leisure & travel and professional training companies don’t. Also, most “academic” startup founders (those listing higher education as their previous industry) are in nanotech, biotech and medical devices. Relationships and mentors are crucial to entrepreneurs’ success - and this is reflected in the connections they have on LinkedIn. Founders are disproportionately connected to venture capitalists, bloggers and recruiters. Most importantly, LinkedIn and the relationships they build in their career help founders find the capital, publicity and talent they need. If you’d like to hear more about the entrepreneur DNA, take a look at at the 2011 Startup Festival.  are LinkedIn professionals who identify themselves as founders (or co-founders) of U.S. companies created after 2000, with a LinkedIn company profile, and that currently have between 2 - 200 employees.

This was an all out academic brawl. The tension in the air was thick. While everyone in the room huddled around their team’s table ready to hit the buzzer, I was standing up at the front stage, thinking about where I was just over a year ago.It was a scorching hot June day in Los Angeles when I was sitting at USC’s commencement, listening to Arnold Schwarzenegger share his knowledge with the graduating class. Between the movie references from Kindergarten Cop and Terminator, my mind wandered off into a daydream, dreading the meek prospects of entering the workforce. When I moved back home to northern California, I immediately made a LinkedIn profile, and started to search through companies that I wanted to work for. I scoured through each company in the valley, looking for employees who went to USC. Once I found alumni who worked at LinkedIn, I reached out to them directly, and asked if they could help out a fellow recent grad. answered my message within a few hours, and offered to meet with me to talk about my career prospects. A few conversations, a rigorous interview process, and two weeks later, I started working with George and my sales career at LinkedIn has been a dream ride since. During the final rounds of the academic decathlon, I realized how fortunate I was to be working for an organization like LinkedIn; an organization that not only cultivates a global mission to promote opportunity for everyone, but also, a mission to constantly invest and reinvest in their own employees. With events like this during our monthly inDay sessions, it gives employees the opportunity to take a breath, relax, and in this case, compete for their school’s pride.

It was the biggest business event of the week -- and the flood of articles and tweets was impossible to ignore. Yet the most shared story across LinkedIn centered on another tech personality, investor , who wrote an essay for the Wall Street Journal called “Why Software Is Eating The World.” There’s one theme tying both topics together: the awesome power of a disruptive force. In Andreessen's essay, he runs through a list of industries recently transformed by software-centric companies. In entertainment, the fastest growing players are all gaming firms. Google has cast a shadow over direct marketing. The telecoms have to match Skype on price and features. As the auto world goes electric and hybrid, software increasingly powers the product. (Full disclosure: he also plugs LinkedIn, in which he’s an investor.) In every case, traditional players have been left struggling to compete. The power of software in business comes from two elements: companies that launch with code at their core can do so cheaply and they can scale at rates impossible in the physical world. A disruptive company using this model can drive costs (and profits) from an entire industry before entrenched players can react. Just ask Borders. Andreessen writes: One person who has made a career of “invading with impunity” is Jobs. He disrupted the music industry with the introduction of iTunes, the mobile industry with iOS and the iPhone, and he’s doing the same to PC makers with the unstoppable spread of the iPad.  (Mashable runs through some of his best moments on video :) Jobs harnessed the power of software, combined it with design prowess and marketing magic and ate a number of worlds — even as his critics kept insisting that Apple was too niche to matter. most-shared stories center on Twitter.

So I shifted gears and landed at Syracuse, focusing on finance and broadcast journalism. Back then I could only dream of working in the CNN newsroom or at The New York Times.

Thanks to groups, not only can members easily find people with related interests, but they can also engage with communities on specific topics related to their professional expertise. Once you’ve found a group of your liking, users have always asked for similar groups that they can check out or participate in. Rather than going through the same laborious process of finding that suitable group, GYML lets you find them instantaneously. Given that many users have asked us how this feature works, here’s a simple explanation on the inner workings of \"Groups You May Like\" on LinkedIn. GYML matches key member profile features against key group features. An optimal matching relies on relevant historical data, key-features and a well-defined metric. More specifically, : We designed the metric to optimize for participation in the community and not necessarily only for group affinity. Indeed, what makes a group valuable, along with its members,  is the member contributions to the professional dialogue. This design can be achieved by an approach we at LinkedIn call ‘data jiu jitsu’: First, match a group to a member based on content affinity, then optimize for the desired behavior (in our case “participation”) which can be done via social learning. Social learning theory tells us that individuals learn by observing other’s behavior and the outcomes of those behaviors. Hence, someone joining a group with high participation from its members is more likely to engage further in the future. : One of the most interesting aspects of GYML are the group features definitions. Beyond the usual suspects that include group title and group description, the real DNA of a group resides within its members. Hence, using a construct of information theory called Mutual Information we generate a “virtual” group profile which, following the homophily concept, can be matched against each member. Another source of information we use as a feature for matching is the popularity of the group in someone’s network. If many of your connections belong to a group, that group will probably be of interest to you. Two interesting edge cases arose with this initial approach: potential mismatch with alumni groups (spurring strong reactions from members) and location specific groups, like “Yahoo India” for e.g. This was resolved by implementing filters that discard groups with an over-representation of a school (location) that does not match the member’s school (location). : To fine-tune the matching process, we leveraged historical data focusing on recent group joins on LinkedIn. To keep the best possible relevance in our matching algorithm, we also applied some filtering. First, we filtered out groups which our members may find controversial. Second, we did not show group recommendations to spammers: members who try to join groups for the only purpose of spamming the group were subsequently removed from the groups. To provide constantly fresh recommendations, group recommendations are updated in real-time when members update their profiles while group features are updated offline on a weekly basis using Hadoop. Note that the latter could be updated more frequently if necessary, but we have found weekly updates to be quite sufficient to ensure freshness of the results. GYML is one of the many Recommendation products we work on here in the SNA group at LinkedIn. Be sure to also read Adil Aijaz’s post on the thinking behind the broader suite of . As a fresh out of school grad, implementing the backend of Groups You May Like gave me a fantastic exposure to many open source projects that we use at LinkedIn. Understanding the inner workings of Lucene, creating huge data flows in Hadoop with our open-source job scheduler Azkaban, training our models in R and pushing all the data to our ultra efficient and open-source Voldemort servers were just a few of the things I got a chance to explore. Having the opportunity to use all these tools to find gold-nuggets from LinkedIn’s huge collection of data was exhilarating."},{"post_categories":["Privacy"],"author":"Ryan Roslansky","title":"Privacy, Advertising, and Putting Members First","date":"August 11, 2011","content":"Over the last few days, some of you may have read stories or blog posts about new forms of advertising that we are testing on our site, called “ \" .

We could have communicated our intentions — to provide more value and relevancy to our members — more clearly.

I am loving every moment. This summer, I got a chance to play with LinkedIn's ad data. The project I worked on was to evaluate the effects of new variables and different methodologies - especially different ad formats - on our ad effectiveness. I initially set up the methodology, a correlation analysis, with a small set of data from our traditional data warehouses but soon realized that I needed a much larger set of data. For this, I learned and used to access our structure and was able to pull massive amounts of data quickly and efficiently. I then utilized and Excel to do the analysis and graphics. I'm a data nerd.

As droves of college students checked in, the energy in the room was focused on hacking right from the start. The interns were gathered for LinkedIn’s first open -- a chance to win a MacBook Air, an iPad or Apple gift card -- but more importantly, a chance to earn permanent bragging rights among their peers. The anticipation mounted as teams were formed, monitors plugged in and the genesis of potential ideas discussed. A little after 7pm, Hackday guru opened the flood gates unleashing the fervor of typing fingers, murmured conversations and illegible chicken scratch on whiteboards. My role at this event was to handle logistics, quickly resolving any issues that came up: food shortage, power outage, computers overheating, interns overheating, etc. We stocked the fridge with an unhealthy supply of energy drinks like Red Bull, Monster, and Rockstar, but it definitely came in handy as interns refueled continuously. We also made sure we had a never-ending supply of food, including snacks like ice cream, chips of all kinds, candy, Chicago deep-dish pizzas, a 2am delivery of Chinese food, breakfast burritos, tacos, and more. Many interns escaped to the lounge area to relax, an oasis complete with over-sized beanbags, Foosball and a ping pong table. Saturday at noon marked the end of hacking and the beginning of preliminary judging. 45 projects were presented where we saw 3D games, music apps, UI frameworks, augmented reality, AI, location apps, IDE extensions, p2p file sharing and even a 20 page report. We picked 15 finalists whose 24 hour hacks were judged by (creator of the Java programming language), (founder of AdMob), and (LinkedIn’s VP of Engineering). The final judging was lively as LinkedIn’s own Ryan Seacrest, Adam Nash, attempted to keep the interns’ heavy eyelids from closing. After 2 hours of presentations, the judges collaborated and announced the winners: As I was pulling out of Stierlin Court almost 35 hours later, the winning team was walking away, a tired pride hung over their shoulders, and I offered them a ride to the nearby train station.

That’s because I’m more than a Risk Specialist. I’m a chef. I’ve always had a passion for cooking. It started when I was a child, helping my mum bake cakes and French pastry. As a teenager, I entered culinary school, then became an apprentice to an elite French Chef who taught me nearly everything I know about cooking. He helped me master fresh bread, croissant and foie gras (among other French classics). After two busy years I went back to school and worked in various hotels and restaurants in France as chef de partie and second de cuisine. After a unique experience interacting with customers in an open-kitchen environment, I knew I needed a change. One that allowed me to spend more time connecting with and helping people. This realisation has led me on a roller-coaster ride since I last touched a saucepan in a professional kitchen. Before landing at LinkedIn, I was a sales assistant, worked in the Internet, automotive and logistic industries, and even became a senior investigator at one of the largest financial institutions. I started here as a Customer Representative, supporting our French-speaking users when the Dublin office had just 13 employees. We now have nearly 90, and we’re hiring in Dublin alone over the next year! While it was amazing to be part of our users’ success and help them build their professional network, it turns out my abilities were even better suited for another role. In just four months I was promoted to Risk Specialist in our fraud and risk department. Now, I interact with LinkedIn users every day—responding to privacy queries and making sure all our users’ information is secure. I may not be a professional chef anymore, but I’m using many of the same skills I built years ago. I have to be organised, creative, flexible, adept at multitasking and serve the needs of our growing global customer base. (Our members, as it turns out, have very specific tastes and needs—just like restaurant goers). And like a gourmet kitchen, the atmosphere here is truly energizing and fuelled by passion.

Our goal with Apply with LinkedIn is to help every professional put their best foot forward, anywhere across the web, when they take that leap to apply for a new position, a dream job. We are going to make it easy for you to submit your profile for any job application on the web with Some of the first companies to debut “Apply with LinkedIn” button on their company websites (besides our own) include Netflix, , and over a thousand other companies. In addition, we’re also working closely with the top Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to help them and their customers match the best candidates for the right jobs. We’ve put an incredible amount of effort to rethink the job application process from end-to-end to make it a one-click submit for any professional. The first step was simple: put the functionality everywhere our members need it. That means packaging it as a simple button that you can recognize anywhere across the web. We’ve made this simple enough to implement so both companies and developers can easily include it on their corporate websites. Once you click on the “Apply with LinkedIn” button, you’ll get a user experience that’s been optimized for the web. In addition to updating your profile real time, LinkedIn will also show you professional connections that work at the company to increase your chances of getting hired through a referral. If you don’t know anybody at the company, we’ll show you people who can introduce you to someone there. This is extremely powerful - statistics show that referrals are the #1 source of external hires at companies. Finally, we record all “Apply with LinkedIn” submissions in the “Saved Jobs” tab (under the Jobs category on LinkedIn) so you have a record of all the jobs you’ve applied to around the web, throughout your career. For companies looking to fill positions, Apply with LinkedIn is just as compelling. It’s flexible enough to work with virtually any talent pipeline by making it far easier to reach the right candidates on LinkedIn. We built Apply with LinkedIn to be customizable for companies from day one, including: We are convinced that Apply with LinkedIn represents the simplest way for companies to increase the quality of job applicants. While the benefits are fairly clear, we put a lot of time into making it as easy as possible for developers to add this functionality on their company website. This small snippet of code is all it takes for you to start offering applicants the chance to apply to your job openings in one simple click. While the above is quite basic, there’s much more you can do with Apply with LinkedIn.

But for some reason, the minute many people turn on a computer or mobile screen, their basic knowledge of etiquette flies out the window. Perhaps because they’re not face to face with others, they forget how to interact. If you’ve noticed this phenomenon, you won’t be surprised that some of the most frequent questions asked during our are queries about etiquette. While every situation and every individual is different, here are some guidelines to help you use LinkedIn in a polite, professional way: I once received a LinkedIn message from a recent grad who asked me for some pretty specific career advice. Since her request was very polite and we had attended the same university, I answered her multiple questions and wished her good luck. And then…I never heard from her again. Because I’d taken so much time to reply, I wrote back and said I was a little disappointed not to receive a thank you. Her response? “I didn’t want to bother you.” Trust me -- a thank you is never a bother and is always appreciated, especially in the impersonal world of online communications. Just because LinkedIn provides a basic message “I'd like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn,” that doesn’t mean you have to use it. Just as no one wants to receive a robocall or a letter to “Dear Occupant,” no one wants to receive a generic request to join your professional network. If the person doesn’t recognize your name and your request has not been customized you might see a lower response rate. You’ll get much better results if you write a brief, personalized, polite note to each potential connection that includes these key elements: Is it time consuming to write such a detailed request to every person? Yes. And that’s exactly why people will respond -- because you’ve shown you are someone who deeply values the people in your network. No matter how customized and well written your connection request, there is no guarantee that everyone you want to connect with will want to connect with you. If you haven’t heard from a potential connection in over a month, it’s okay to follow up and perhaps send that person an InMail (if you have a premium LinkedIn account) to remind them that you’ve reached out and would like to connect. Perhaps you can elaborate a bit on why connecting with you might be of value. If that doesn’t work, it’s best to move on to people who are more interested or responsive. As in real life, you can’t force someone to become a friend. Likewise, you don’t have to accept every connection request you receive. If you see a request from someone you don’t know, there are two ways to handle it: If you accept a connection request and change your mind later, you can “unconnect” from someone using LinkedIn’s feature. The person will not be alerted. Of course, if that person looks through his or her contacts or attempts to send you a message, you will no longer be shown as a 1st-degree connection. You know “that guy” at conferences who shakes every single person’s hand, distributes his business cards or brochures like candy on Halloween and can talk nonstop for 10 minutes about how great he is? Don’t be that guy (or gal) -- at conferences or on LinkedIn! LinkedIn was built on the idea of trusted professional relationships, not self-promotion, so make sure that you use the site as much to help your contacts as you hope to be helped. This means: When you do have something purely promotional you’d like to share, such as a webcast you’re hosting or a new blog post you’ve written, send the announcement to a targeted list of people in your network that you think would be truly interested and/or post the announcement in the appropriate place in groups -- the “Promotions” tab -- where people expect to find such information. The amazing thing is, the more you help others, the more they are likely to have a positive view of you and your business. This will ultimately be more beneficial than any blatant self-promotion could be. Use good “real world” judgment, be polite and treat others as you hope to be treated.

As a recruiter for 15 years, I became an active user, spending most of my time on the site sourcing the best candidates for corporate clients. So I was beyond thrilled to be recruited to join LinkedIn as an account executive in the New York Sales team earlier this year. In March, I started training at LinkedIn’s Mountain View headquarters. That’s when my ailments struck - I had terrible back aches, stomach pain and a persistent cough. I wasn’t sure what was wrong, but I was determined to get through the training so I loaded up on ibuprofen to get through the week. After returning to New York and undergoing extensive testing, I received some devastating news: I had stage 4 Lymphoma. I was shocked. It turned out I had a huge tumor near my kidney that was pushing on my back, stomach and lungs. I went on disability just three weeks after joining LinkedIn, and I stayed in touch with my colleagues through . In one of my recent blogs, I recounted a dream I had about my guardian angel, an old blue Volkswagen bug with a headlight that winked and a front bumper that smiled at me. Now, whenever I feel like I may be in trouble, I get some peace when I envision that winking car on my shoulder. On June 16th, I celebrated my 39th birthday and went into the New York office for a short visit. The moment I stepped in the door, I was greeted with hundreds of blue, winking VW bug cut-outs and hand prints with personal messages from my colleagues—many of whom I’d never met. The cut-outs were everywhere- on the walls and on each employee’s desk, including my own. I was told that the blue VW bug sitting on each person’s desk was a daily reminder that if I was strong enough to beat cancer, they themselves could do anything. I was absolutely blown away by their thoughtfulness and creativity, and it really renewed my commitment to get strong and go back to work with these amazing people who have called, emailed, even accompanied me to chemotherapy treatments. I’m currently halfway through my chemo treatment. I feel great, and even though I have a long way to go, I know that with determination and hard work I can beat this thing (since that is my specialty!). LinkedIn has played such a huge role in helping me to not only cope with this disease, but also giving me something to look forward to. I think about my colleagues every day — their support has motivated me to fight, get well and return to work. LinkedIn is so much more than just a website; we are an employer with some of the most caring, compassionate people I’ve ever met. I feel truly privileged to be part of the LinkedIn family."},{"post_categories":["Featured","LinkedIn Tips"],"author":"Nicole Williams","title":"4 Tips to deal with “Horrible Bosses”","date":"July 8, 2011","content":"Does the new movie ring familiar?  If you are coping with a less-than stellar boss, it may be time to take action.

Men are more savvy networkers in the cosmetics industry. Wait, what? That was exactly our reaction when we saw the initial results for our latest data insights blog post on the differences in social networking behavior between men and women. The overall result in the US is that men are overall more savvy networkers than women, but the real insights start to surface when you start slicing and dicing by industry and company. Check out the infographic below highlighting some main insights, followed by more details and discussion below. Men are more savvy networkers globally, but the data show that men and women exhibit differences in their online professional networking behaviors. People we’ve polled were not surprised that industries like “Law Enforcement” and “Capital Markets” are male savvy, but “Cosmetics” really stands as a male savvy industry given that it’s a female oriented industry. The same is true for the top female savvy industries, “Ranching” and “Tobacco”, which stand out since many would consider them a male bastion. In the middle are industries where men and women are equally savvy about networking in similar ways: “Market Research,” “Media Production,” “Dairy,” “Individual and Family Services” and “Paper & Forest Products.” Another cool cut of the data is when we look at savviness at the company level. In the US, some examples of companies where males are the more savvy networkers are Walmart, Kaiser Permanente, and, surprisingly, Mary Kay (a majority / women oriented company). Best Buy is a highly female savvy company, as are Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. And, then there are companies like Comcast that fall right in the middle -- “neutral savviness” part -- of the spectrum. Our results on gender differences in online professional networking behavior are in line with research showing gender differences in social network sharing, competition, multitasking, etc. In the case of our data, there are several things relating to gender that could explain the results: seniority, job function, desire for the minority gender to connect with the majority gender (or stay close to the minority gender), etc. Our goal with this post was not necessarily to test any of these hypotheses but instead to surface differences and spark a discussion as to why the behaviors in each industry or company exist. Do you see similar behavior in your industry or company? Comment away... Also, if you’re into data like we are, and are interested in working on a world-class Data Science team, let us know @ . To generate our “networking savviness” index, the Analytics Team grabbed the current industry, current company, and professional connections for our members in the US. We also needed to know the gender of each of our members. We don’t ask our members for this during the registration process, but we can guess a person’s gender using their first name and some previously established techniques using a database of baby names. With this data in our hands, and working with the inspiration of the piñatas hanging over our desks and the soothing hum of the Analytics Team’s kegerator, we came up with a definition of our online professional networking “savviness” index. We measure networking \"savviness\" as a ratio of two things: 1) the ratio of one-way connections that men have to connections that women have, and 2) the ratio of male members on LinkedIn to female members. We label an industry as “female savvy” when, for example, 45% of the industry is female and where women have 70% of the connections. A perfectly neutral industry is one in which the % of females in the industry is equal to the % of connections that women have in the industry."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News","Featured"],"author":"Allen Blue","title":"Welcoming LinkedIn's Executive Editor","date":"June 22, 2011","content":"We believe there are three distinct dimensions to delivering relevant information and knowledge to our members.

I can honestly say that June’s “play-themed” InDay succeeded for me on both fronts. Let me explain. Recently, my 7-year-old daughter, Siena, asked me if we could have a “kids day” at my work. I asked around, and before I knew it, my day job in Sales had temporarily morphed into chief event planner for LinkedIn’s first at our Mountain View campus. Thankfully, helped by a long list of ideas from my daughter, the Employee Experience Team of and , and a team of 50 enthusiastic volunteers from across the company, the day took on a life of its own. Over 200 kids participated in a range of activities that were educational, inspirational and most of all – fun. VP of People Operations opened the day by welcoming the kids with a playful pop quiz of LindkedIn office facts, and handed out prizes for correct answers. Equipped with maps, kids and their parents were then sent on a self-guided scavenger hunt throughout the campus to learn about many of the different jobs our colleagues do day to day. Employee speakers led workshops on various topics including product management and volunteerism. In one of the more popular sessions - engineering and inventing - our VP of Product encouraged the kids to think about how things they like to do today could spark them to create a life changing invention. Unsurprisingly, there was at least one future paleontologist, Xbox designer and inventor in the room! – and at times it was hard to tell between the kids and the grownups who was having more fun. From face painting and spin art projects to bounce houses and a rock climbing wall, there was something for everyone. The \"Create a Soccer Ball Challenge” also gave us a chance to look at how life is for children and adults in other parts of the world, as we attempted to create a soccer ball out of materials on hand, just as many children in underdeveloped countries do when they want to play. While the day for me was about creating a great experience for kids, I learned from it as well. I was able to see first-hand the truth in the saying: “Kids just want to be with you, [their parent].” As parents, we try to prepare and plan for everything. As InDay volunteers, we planned, discussed and organized every aspect of the day, and yet parts turned out differently than planned. What I noticed from the kids, though, was that they were playing and laughing just the same. So tonight, when my daughter asked me to come outside and play, I set aside what I was doing and went outside with her instead. She gave me a big smile and we had many laughs together. In the end, I think that’s what play (and InDay) is really about: connecting with others in simple, meaningful and often unpredictable ways.

With LinkedIn growing at an unprecedented rate, we are always looking for talented individuals to join our team. To give you an insider’s view into what makes our engineers tick, we’ve asked Adil Aijaz, multi-talented engineer, expert data wrangler, and trail runner, a few questions about working at LinkedIn. I get excited by the ability to see millions of LinkedIn members interact with the results of my code as they provide real-time feedback with their behavior. As a result, I have the flexibility to try out many new ideas and let our members decide what they prefer to guide my next steps. I also enjoy the opportunity at LinkedIn to work on the entire application stack: data crunching on Hadoop; machine learning; writing code in the data, application, and presentation layer; all the way to managing our application's deployment. This well rounded experience keeps things exciting, making everyday different from the last. At LinkedIn, we’re constantly challenged by some pretty big engineering questions that very few companies have to deal with: How do we delight millions of members at scale with speed? How do we leverage the uniquely professional and valuable data we have in ways that will add value to a member’s LinkedIn experience? As engineers, the uniqueness of our experience lies in this combination of constant innovation at scale and speed. For example, our cloud team provides a feature unique among all social networks, which is the shortest path between any two users on the network, up to the third degree network. Providing these paths for any two of the more than 100 million members of LinkedIn in real-time is challenging to say the least. And that is precisely what makes the LinkedIn engineering experience so unique. Before I came to LinkedIn, I worked as a specialized data analyst. I read papers, prototyped ideas, and then let more seasoned systems experts productize my ideas. At LinkedIn, not only have I continued growing in my data analytics role, I have also had to work as a pure software engineer, a site reliability engineer, and a Quality Assurance engineer for my product. This exposure has helped me grow into a well-rounded professional. Of course, data scientists who prefer to stick to pure scientist roles have the freedom to do so at LinkedIn. In addition, LinkedIn gives employees the opportunity to explore new areas through and . I use these opportunities to learn about things that may have nothing to do with my day to day work, but are useful to my professional growth. Before joining LinkedIn, I was not familiar with LinkedIn's talent pool. Since then, I have been constantly amazed by the talent of my colleagues and the sheer fun of working with them. For instance, one of my colleagues, along with a former colleague, developed the algorithms and platform for recommendations on LinkedIn. Similarly, Jay Kreps read a paper on distributed key value stores, which led to his research that culminated in Voldemort - a critical infrastructure piece that many LinkedIn products use to compute fast data lookups. Our search team wrote an open source, real time, faceted on top of Lucene. wrote the framework. On the fun side of life, some of my colleagues are big on organizing surf trips or happy hours. Within my team, we have a tradition called “InPain” which involves doing tough trail runs once a month as a team. All of this contributes to a bottom up way of work-and-play that makes working here enjoyable. Like other Silicon Valley companies, LinkedIn offers many traditional perks. But, my favorite is not a traditional perk, rather it is courtesy of our office location: the running trail around the office (see picture above). Having meetings over runs along the bay make for the most enjoyable and productive meetings I have had in my career. I’ve had 1-on-1s with my manager, discussed thorny engineering issues with senior engineers, and discussed career issues with my director all over a nice long run along the water's edge.

Case in point: Over 1,600 people from around the world registered for our May “LinkedIn for Job Seekers” webinar, and participants asked one question more than any other: As the global economy seems to be improving a bit and we’re reaching the midpoint of the year, it appears that people who’ve been contemplating a move for a while are now ready to take action. While everyone in transition has a unique situation, here are some suggestions for how to use LinkedIn to help make a successful career change: From the moment you begin considering a change, start to read as much as you can about the industry or function you want to join. Know which companies are in the news, what the hot products or services are and when key conferences are taking place. Being in the know will help you discover organizations that might be hiring and will help you make a good impression as you begin networking and eventually interviewing for positions in your new industry. A great way to do this research is through , a new, free tool that customizes your news experience by sourcing content from your network and lets you follow industries you might be interested in. You can set up LinkedIn Today’s personalized news dashboard to keep you informed on all the news in the industry you want to pursue. You can even have the top daily industry headlines sent right to your email inbox. Another great way to research new industries or companies is with . It’s easy to get started: just search for specific keyword, topics or products you’d like to track and find the hottest trending topics in your desired industry. Your next crucial task is to revise your LinkedIn profile so it supports your career change goals. Start with your headline -- the most important piece of real estate on your profile -- and use it to promote the transition you want to make. For instance, “Experienced corporate executive seeking position in nonprofit management.” If your job hunt is not public, try a general headline such as “ Experienced product and marketing executive.” Next, write a very strong Summary statement that briefly explains what you’re doing now and the fact that you’re changing careers -- don’t leave it up to the reader to guess that you want to make a change. Be sure to keep your explanation concise and positive (i.e., never lament the fact that your current industry is in decline or that you got laid off and are being forced into a switch). Then focus on explaining your “ ” -- those skills you have that can apply to multiple industries or roles. Examples of transferable skills include: people management, technical training, sales, communication, negotiation, leadership, creativity, organization and general administrative skills. As much as possible, you’ll want to mention skills that you know are important in the industry or function you aspire to. Not sure what those are? Look at LinkedIn job postings and the profiles of people in your desired career for ideas. Once you’ve revised your profile, ask a few people who have a background in this field to check it out and provide any additional “insider” tips. Joining LinkedIn groups in your desired industry or function is a great way to build your knowledge, image and network in your new field. Remember that your group memberships appear on your LinkedIn profile, so they indicate to people that you are serious about your new career (if you are job hunting secretly, you can adjust your profile settings so these group memberships do not appear). You can remain in one or two groups related to your former industry, but you need to give the impression that the majority of your networking is now taking place in the field you want to enter. Find which groups to join by using the Groups Directory feature and by looking up the profiles of people you admire in your desired career and seeing what groups they belong to. Try observing group discussions for a while to see what people are talking about, and then join in the conversation. Once you feel comfortable and confident, start to interact in discussions, post and answer questions and respond to polls. Groups are a great way to get noticed and start to build industry relationships. Networking is crucial to a career change, particularly if you are currently employed and not able to publicly announce your career change plans. Start by reaching out individually to everyone you already know -- friends, family, neighbors, former colleagues, former classmates -- to explain your desired transition and ask directly for their support. When you do this, don’t make the common mistake of sending out generic, blast messages about your job search. No one likes these and they generate little response. I know it’s time consuming, but the very best way to enlist your existing contacts in your career change efforts is to reach out to each person individually. In each note, be very specific about what you’re looking for as people probably still identify you with your previous career. Ask to set up a phone call or coffee to meet and talk further, and be sure to offer to help each person with anything he or she might need. If you make the extra effort to connect one-on-one, most people will make the extra effort to help you. In addition to networking with your existing contacts in any industry, nothing beats talking to a real person who has firsthand experience in the profession that interests you. Ask your existing contacts if they know anyone in your desired field they would be willing introduce you to. Additionally, use to research people in your desired industry with whom you have something in common (e.g. you attended the same university, worked at the same employer in the past or belong to a shared LinkedIn group). You can reach out through LinkedIn connection requests or InMail (if you have a premium account) to request a brief, informal discussion. During all of these conversations with industry members, ask people to recommend insider tips, must-read publications and advice on what jobs in their field are most realistic for people to transition into. Keep in mind that it’s not appropriate to ask any of these contacts for a job, just for advice and guidance. And don’t forget to send a gracious thank you email to thank people for their time. Sign up for email alerts of LinkedIn job listings in your desired career field. You can customize these alerts by job function, location, keyword and other factors to make sure you’re receiving exactly the opportunities you want. It’s never too soon to start reviewing available positions and applying for roles that look like a good fit for your transferable skills. When applying for a job in a new profession, provide a detailed cover letter that maps your experience to the job requirements. If you can connect the dots for the employer, and showcase why you are a good fit for the job, you will be more successful in the application process. Finally, remember that LinkedIn and other people’s help can only do so much. You may find through your rebranding, research and networking efforts that you need to build additional skills and experience to successfully transition to the new position you are seeking. If this is the case, start to build new experiences any way you can -- volunteer work, internships, blog posts, additional education, etc. -- to show that you’re really serious about breaking into a new profession.

With a strong sense of purpose, she has become a passionate champion for the transformation of education in this country. Known for her bold, controversial moves to overhaul D.C. public schools, Michelle has taken her cause nationally as the Founder & CEO of , an organization dedicated to transforming public education in America. Michelle spoke about what she’s doing to reform the U.S. public school system - and put students first - during a presentation at LinkedIn’s corporate headquarters in Mountain View. See a brief overview below or click through the entire presentation . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdzHFG4HRc&fmt=22] Michelle talked about how, as a nation, the United States’ public education system has fallen behind and how even our best performing students are not competing globally. The top 5 percent of children in the U.S. are ranked 23rd among 29 developed nations across the globe. “ ” Michelle said. “ ” Her solution: to start a movement on behalf of the nation’s children by mobilizing parents, teachers, administrators and others to take action and produce meaningful results on both the local and national level. Michelle launched StudentsFirst with an audacious goal: to raise $1 billion with 1 million members by the end of this year. Within the first week, the organization had 100,000 members. Through Michelle’s passion, StudentsFirst has tapped into a desire of the American people to get involved in education and do something about the problems they see. Social media can be a transformational force to engage with large groups of people across the country, she said. It can bring together not only those whose viewpoints vary widely, but also like-minded individuals—such as teachers who support education reform, to let them know they’re not alone.

But these aren’t your typical interns. They’re participating in , a one-year intensive education and internship program that strives to close the opportunity divide by providing urban young adults, ages 18-24, with a unique combination of job skills, experience, and support that will empower them to reach their potential through professional careers and higher education. [caption id=\"attachment_6919\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"498\"] L-R: Candida O’Neill, Earl-Bert Parco, Keith Jones, Darnell Torres, Derisha Johnson, Anthony Tamalo, and Mike Jennings (program sponsor)[/caption] LinkedIn is the first Silicon Valley-based company to take part in Year Up. The program, which gives students access to career paths they might not have found, supports LinkedIn’s vision of creating economic opportunity for professionals around the world. This includes aspiring professionals as well. After successfully completing the first six months of the Year Up program mastering business fundamentals - appropriate social etiquette, email or presentation basics, etc. - students are placed in internships with local partner companies, like LinkedIn. Many of the students who participate in this program come from disadvantaged communities. Some only have experience in retail stores or restaurants. Most of them have never attended college or stepped foot in a corporate environment before. Each of our six interns is doing a six-month rotation in our IT department - from Events and Audio/Video, to mobile, Helpdesk and Hardware Support. They are getting a comprehensive understanding of IT, along with all the other employee perks. We’ve been very impressed with the results that the interns have delivered during their time here. In addition to providing technical support for LinkedIn’s employees, they’ve become a valuable part of our team, adding energy, enthusiasm while helping reduce our team’s workload. Take, for example, , a 19-year-old from Daly City, Calif. Earl-Bert joined Year Up to help pay for college tuition and earn college credit. He was immediately attracted to LinkedIn because he wanted to learn everything he possibly could about computers. Earl-Bert loves troubleshooting and configuring mobile devices, and he’s done an amazing job for our mobile team. He hopes to return to college and launch a career in the IT industry. With his natural desire to learn about music, soundboards and mics, , a 20-year-old from San Francisco, has been a valuable asset for our A/V team. He plans to enroll in an ethical hacking class at City College of San Francisco and may even venture into the programming world. “Before LinkedIn, I only had an idea of how a soundboard works,” Anthony said. “I’ve familiarized myself with the different teams that make up Corporate IT. My resume is now extensive.” We look forward to helping these talented individuals succeed professionally, here at LinkedIn or wherever their next move may take them."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Life"],"author":"Barbara Sanchez","title":"Who is LinkedIn's Marathon Mom?","date":"June 2, 2011","content":"You don’t run 100 miles a week without a little motivation. For me, that motivation comes from a love of sport. I’ve always been involved in running, cycling or swimming. I’ve competed in triathlons and marathons across Europe; it’s a great way to do something I enjoy and meet new people. Last October, I earned the national title as the first Irish woman to cross the finish line at the Dublin Marathon, in 2 hours, 39 minutes and 39 seconds (2:39:39).  I finished the race just one year after my son, Benjamin, was born. Now, I’m training with the goal of qualifying for the marathon for the 2012 Olympic Games, representing Ireland. I’m just two minutes away from the qualifying time (2:37).  I’m also in the process of getting an Irish passport. As a new mom with a full-time job, balancing work with motherhood isn’t easy. LinkedIn's perks at our Dublin office - on site showers and free food for employees - makes it easier for me to fit in a 6 to 7 mile run on my way to work, and again on my way home when commuting to and from the office here in Dublin. I’m never in the car—I’m typically running, swimming or cycling. When I’m tired, I don’t think about it; I’m never lazy because I can’t be lazy. I joined LinkedIn’s Sales Development team about three months ago because it was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. Since LinkedIn has a growing presence in Dublin, I can be involved in big decisions and put my language skills to good use (I speak English, French and Spanish). Just about everyone in Dublin wants to work for LinkedIn. The atmosphere is electric —there are people here from all nationalities, and we’re adding about 15 new employees every two weeks. In fact, LinkedIn is growing so fast (with nearly 100 employees just in our Dublin office) that we’re moving offices here in a few months to relocate to a bigger space within the city center. Our office is often bustling with events like Family Day, , when I can bring my husband and son to work with me. When you’re very busy, it’s the little things like this at work that make a huge difference. Training for the 2012 Olympic marathon is the opportunity of a lifetime.  I’m fortunate to work in a place that allows me to both pursue my professional dream in sales and my personal passion."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Mobile","Product News"],"author":"Frank Yoo","title":"Navigating LinkedIn News on the iPhone","date":"May 23, 2011","content":"LinkedIn Today, our social news product, on March 10th both on our website as well as a standalone feature - - on our iPhone App. LinkedIn News for mobile was built to make top industry news available to professionals on the go, wherever they work.

During our most recent Hackday at LinkedIn, I had the opportunity to share one of these ideas with the rest of the company.  I’m also excited to say that the LinkedIn Connection Timeline is now live on LinkedIn Labs! A few months ago, I found myself thinking about my connections and the nature of my LinkedIn network. There was an \"aha!\" moment where I realized that LinkedIn has a unique characteristic which others lack -- it is three-dimensional. The first dimension is the actual connection. The second is the implicit grouping of connections which tie the social graph together. Many social networks have these first two dimensions, but what makes LinkedIn's network special is its third dimension: time. Our users' profiles describe a story of their career trajectories, from humble beginnings in college and your first job to the here and now. Once I had this epiphany, I thought it’d be cool to create a visualization that would enable LinkedIn users to view the connections they've made throughout the span of their careers. Using two simple calls, I built an early prototype of what would eventually become the Connection Timeline. As I began to add more visual elements to the timeline, I realized that I needed a designer to help me manage the clutter on the visual elements, while at the same time causing a aha moment when you see it scroll. I enlisted the help of my colleague , who took a project that was rough around the edges and turned it into something really elegant and polished. The final product is what you see below. One of the really interesting things about the Connection Timeline is that no two career time lines look alike. Each mirrors the path that a professional took to get to where they are today. As you can see, my timeline is slightly sparse, representing a mere seven-year span so far.

I had just started in the newly formed sales team the August prior to our fourth birthday and remember it wasn't much of celebration. Our fifth birthday was celebrated in a much more memorable fashion, with an actual party.  We were five years old and had a reason to celebrate with close to 10 million members. At that point, I thought, this is cool but what kind of company celebrates a birthday and why? Since then, LinkedIn has grown at a much faster pace and so have our teams across the globe. So, when our sixth birthday rolled around, our new CEO, Jeff Weiner, asked me to put together a real party. So, in our office kitchen, we had margaritas, Mexican food and cupcakes from Kara's on Cinco De Mayo. It was a fun afternoon of connecting with co-workers whom I didn't see regularly any more given the pace at which we were growing. When the date rolled around the next year, the question was “are we celebrating again?” And with a resounding \"Yes\", the tradition stuck. Since last year, we’ve moved the party outside to fit everyone. The tradition is now something we look forward to every year just like a little kid getting excited about the bouncy house arriving in their driveway. This year, we even had (my dog, Willow) besides balloons, drinks and many more tacos. Recently, I transitioned from the sales team into a role where I am responsible for making work at LinkedIn fun and inspiring, through such employee events. As I planned the party this year, it felt like a dream job come true as I was – for the first time – organizing our birthday party in an official capacity. A few things remain the same each time this special day comes around. One, it's a fun afternoon of connecting with co-workers, the talented people with whom I am truly privileged to work. I always catch up with someone I haven't talked to in a while; this year it was , one of my colleagues who has recently relocated.

Even more gratifying was LinkedIn’s strong overall presence, with about 100 employees who registered for the sold-out course. Running has always been my true passion. When I joined LinkedIn in the Finance department three years ago, I started training for my ultimate goal: to qualify for the 2012 Olympic Games Marathon. I’m fortunate that I get to pursue my dream while working in a career that’s in line with my passion for the health and wellness industry. When LinkedIn offered me a chance to move from my former Finance role to the Facilities team to start LinkedIn’s Health and Wellness program, I didn’t have to think twice. It was a natural fit, given my athletic background. (I ran Track and Field and Cross Country in high school and college, and I’ve competed professionally in triathlons, marathons and Ironmans). My managers have allowed me to have a flexible schedule, where I can run 15-20 miles a day and still work a full-time gig. As part of the Health and Wellness program I developed, LinkedIn offers great perks like our on-site gym, boot camp facility and yoga/dance studio. We also have miles of open trails surrounding our Mountain View Headquarters for runners like me who want to build camaraderie while hitting the trails with our colleagues. The Health and Wellness program has been an amazing success—about 65 percent of LinkedIn Mountain View employees take advantage of free classes like Yoga, Pilates and Zumba, which are offered throughout the day to accommodate their diverse schedules. We also have a unique nutritional program based on metabolic typing. We take it a step further, by encouraging employees to register for local sports leagues and big events, like the Global Corporate Challenge and Bay to Breakers. I’ll proudly be wearing my LinkedIn gear when I run the Chicago Marathon this fall. It’s my way of saying thanks to a company that has supported me in pursuing my Olympic dreams while giving me the opportunity to create an employee program around my passions – this speaks volumes about how important employees are to the company."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Developer Network"],"author":"Daniel Roth","title":"When LinkedIn met the Fortune 500","date":"May 6, 2011","content":"Yesterday, the . The program takes our annual Fortune 500 list -- the foremost method for ranking business -- and turns it into a vital tool for doing business. Users can target 1,000 of the biggest companies in the U.S., find the right ones to meet with, track breaking news and Twitter traffic, and build, map and share lists of prospects. All of those features we knew we wanted when we started building this app in the fall of 2010. But the one offering we knew we had to have was some way to let users discover who they knew at each company. And that’s where LinkedIn -- and the LinkedIn APIs -- proved so essential. Working with LinkedIn’s , , , and , the Time Inc. developers were able create an HTML5 Web app that can scour a 1,000-company list and get instant snapshots of employee counts. Before users even pick companies they want to connect with, they can scan to find which companies they have the best shot at getting in the door with. Then users can generate custom screens of contacts, filtering by 1st- and 2nd-degree connections. So imagine a busy salesperson is traveling through Los Angeles and wants to meet with every company in his industry that might just buy his widgets. Using our app and LinkedIn’s network, he can find the best companies, determine who he knows there and, using Fortune’s corporate reporting and Google News, become an instant expert. Even better, this is just the beginning. Our developers are busy investigating all of the other APIs at LinkedIn that will allow us to keep making this app more functional and more essential.

But I guess that’s what makes me unique; I love a good challenge. I’m a designer at heart, but I enjoy trying new things and learning quickly. That’s why working here at LinkedIn has been such a great experience. I joined LinkedIn because I had a lot of respect for the products, and I wanted to be a part of a medium-size company that was about to become much larger. In the past year-and-a-half, I’ve probably changed desks within the Design team about six times. Currently, I design software products, such as the new analytics tool that debuted in December. But what’s really great about working here is that LinkedIn has allowed me to stoke my creative interests both inside and outside of work. Last year, I joined a team competing for the challenge to design a 100 mile per gallon commuter car. My manager was incredibly supportive and allowed me to take time off on short notice-- he understood that this was an exciting opportunity that couldn’t be missed. I flew to Seattle and worked for 10 days straight to help a team of volunteers build a 100 mpg car from scratch. The car received 10th place out of 150 teams! Currently, I’m spending my weekends working on a project for the endurance race for $500 cars. My Lemons team has taken a 1989 BMW 325i sedan (purchased for $400) and are converting it into a vehicle that resembles the ambulance in “Ghostbusters.” Our first race is a little over a month away, and I’m pretty excited about it. Another fun project I’m tinkering with right now is “latte art,” where I pour milk through a shot of espresso to create shapes, like trees and flowers. I bought an espresso machine on eBay and restored it to perfect this art at home. Since LinkedIn provides free food and beverages to employees, including use of our on-site espresso machines, I can test out my creations on my colleagues here. LinkedIn has also encouraged me to pursue my passions on the job. Recently, I’ve been working as a staff photographer for some of our on-site events. I’ve also submitted a couple projects for LinkedIn’s monthly . I even won one competition last year, for my idea for a URL shortener. Very cool. So what’s next?

The program, run by non-profit , has expanded to five cities across the country (including Berkeley, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and two programs in Mountain View), serving over 250 girls. The LinkedIn Mountain View program will culminate in “Pitch Night” at LinkedIn’s headquarters on Wednesday, April 27, when the girls will pitch their business plans to a panel of judges that includes LinkedIn CEO, , Venture Capitalist, , and Entrepreneur and Professor, .  The evening will also feature a keynote by , co-founder of SpoonDate. Winners of each regional Pitch Night will come to the San Francisco Bay Area for a “National Pitch Night” on May 21, where they’ll compete to have their app professionally developed and distributed on the Google Android Marketplace. I’m very excited that LinkedIn has sponsored this year’s Technovation Challenge. LinkedIn is an ideal platform for transforming the world by tapping the talent and creativity of the world's professionals to solve big problems. I've already used LinkedIn to find mentors, speakers, judges, and volunteers for the program. As students who have gone through the program advance in their education and their careers, they will use LinkedIn to find internships, mentors, jobs, and, eventually, funding for their entrepreneurial ventures. Yet another benefit with having LinkedIn host the program is that it’s made it easier for women mentors from LinkedIn to participate. This year, four LinkedIn employees, including , , Lili Wu, and have been able to take advantage of the opportunity to mentor these incredibly talented girls from neighboring schools. As software engineers, product managers and data scientists, it’s been personally rewarding for each of us to mentor these young girls and give them the skills and confidence they need to be successful in computer science and entrepreneurship. The girls are avid users of social media and technology, and they have a keen and sophisticated sense of what makes a technology product useful and “cool.” Watching them in action as they develop their ideas, it's easy to see that with coaching and encouragement, they can become the next generation of product designers, technologists, and entrepreneurs. ."},{"post_categories":["Infographic"],"author":"Monica Rogati","title":"Top CEO Names across the globe: Brad, Bland or Brand?","date":"April 27, 2011","content":"Are some names more successful than others?

Or are both your career and choice of name influenced by factors like personality and values? Any attempt to explore these questions would need some cold, hard data.  LinkedIn is the perfect place to start: you can find 100 million professionals, their first names and their corresponding career histories (or, as our data science team calls it, a fun project waiting to happen).  I took advantage of one of our to examine the correlations between people's first names and their career choices.

Female CEOs, on the other hand, use their full name to project a more professional image.

It's because May 5th was the day we first launched LinkedIn back in 2003. Eight years is a long time, but in the technology world, it can seem like an eternity. Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, Twitter... none of them existed in May 2003. Neither did the iPhone or Android. Internet Explorer 6 ruled the web; Safari was in beta, Firefox was still Firebird, and Chrome was a few years away. And Justin Bieber was just another precocious Canadian nine-year-old. [slideshow] LinkedIn itself has changed dramatically since those early days. The LinkedIn network started with just ten people -- the founding employees connected to each other. Since then, it's grown into the world's largest professional network with more than 100 million professionals in over 200 countries and territories. LinkedIn currently has over 1000 employees in 12 offices around the world, including London, Paris, Sydney, and Mumbai. Perhaps most importantly, our kitchen now contains more than just Bagel Bites and Diet Coke. My own life today would probably be unrecognizable to my 2003 self. When we launched LinkedIn, I was single and dating a sweet, accordion-playing girl I'd met just a couple weeks earlier. Fast forward to today and we've been married for five years, with two fantastic children, ages three and nine months. All-night coding marathons have been replaced by repeated bedtime readings of \"The Donut Chef.\" And that's to say nothing of the gray hairs I've picked up along the way. One thing has stayed constant through those eight years, however: I'm still working at LinkedIn. The average American changes jobs every four to five years; in Silicon Valley, it's often much faster. So why am I still here? For starters, it's fantastic to work at a company where everyone's voice counts. Have a feature idea? Recruit some teammates, build it on Hackday and it . Wondering about our product priorities? Ask the executive staff at our bi-weekly company meetings. It's hard to preserve that spirit of openness and collaboration when a company doubles in size every year, but we've managed to do it with small teams and a transparency I've never encountered at any other company. But what excites and drives me most of all is this: despite all we've accomplished over the past eight years, I believe LinkedIn's future holds even more promise than its past. With over 100 million users, we can provide more connections, more insights, and more professional opportunities than ever before. Professionals depend on staying on top of news in their industry; makes that process dramatically easier. Our users want to showcase their talents in a competitive job market; helps you promote your skills, nurture them, and discover new skills you need to succeed. These and a host of other new and improved products show how LinkedIn can connect the world's professionals and make each one of them more productive and successful. At LinkedIn, we're in a unique position to completely change the way people work, and that's an opportunity that doesn't come along every day."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Life"],"author":"Marissa Dulaney","title":"LinkedIn Cribs: From Club Tron to a Yellow Submarine","date":"April 8, 2011","content":"What does a casino, a night at the movies, the zoo, and a yellow submarine have in common?

Employees managed to transform our new office space  – which had basic and corporate, albeit nice, décor – into a place full of energy, personality, and buzz. So how did we do it? Each team in the company was given a starting budget to personalize their area and told there would be a prize for the best row. That got the ball rolling.

Some of the highlights from the event: We topped it all off with an open house where the entire campus could check out each row’s decorations and themed refreshments on a Friday evening. It was a great opportunity to explore our colleagues’ new digs especially since we’ve been moving around a lot as we expand our campus in Mountain View.

With Microsoft's foray into interactive email around , LinkedIn sees the potential for email to once again empower the working professional by removing some of the burdens of staying connected. Starting today, we've begun to roll out one of our connection invite emails using Active Views to give LinkedIn's Hotmail users the full advantage of interactivity within their inbox. When you invite someone to connect on LinkedIn and the other person accepts, you receive an email about the successful connection. Within that email, LinkedIn provides insights about the other person's network by showing who they are connected with and which companies they follow. With Active Views, you now have the ability to take multiple actions directly within email. Which means its much easier to connect to people you may know or follow companies that you're interested in without leaving that email. One of the ways our members interact with LinkedIn is through email. Traditionally, email has more or less served as a delivery vehicle for static content. Static content succeeds when it's used properly to present information or to drive a limited set of actions. However, today's world demands much more from the working professional. To stay connected, we're asked to accomplish more, oftentimes across different sites and mediums. The traditional email fails to help manage this onslaught. At LinkedIn, our passion is to create products that help our members be more productive and successful at what they do. Professionals come to LinkedIn to stay connected with other professionals, and create opportunities for themselves and their networks as well as to gain insights that help them be great professionally.

Although it’s still cold outside, you know that spring really is on the way. If you’re like me, that first whiff of warm air also gives you the decluttering bug. That’s right -- it’s spring cleaning season. While most of us do some spring cleaning in our homes and offices, today I’m going to talk about spring cleaning online. These days, our computers and databases and social networking profiles can become just as cluttered and musty as our closets and garages and desk drawers. If you feel as if your LinkedIn experience could use some sprucing up this spring, try implementing these 5 tips: If you’re not attracting a lot of interest to your LinkedIn profile, take a look at what words you use to describe yourself. They might be doing more harm than good. Last month, LinkedIn released a that are most overused by professionals based in the United States. According to LinkedIn data, those terms are: Why should you avoid these words? They’re not “bad” in and of themselves, but because they are so common on LinkedIn profiles, they can appear empty or meaningless to a potential employer or networking contact; there’s nothing memorable about them. If you have these words on your profile, try replacing them with more specific descriptions of your accomplishments and skills. One of the first things people see when they click on your LinkedIn profile is your headshot. Could yours use some improvement? Your LinkedIn photo accompanies all of your status updates, group discussion comments and any other activity on the site, so you want it to be a positive reflection of you. I like LinkedIn photos that are high quality (not blurry or grainy), professional (not casual snapshots or screen grabs of wedding photos with the spouse cut out) and those that feature a smile or positive expression. One recent trend I’ve noticed is taking one’s photo in career context. For instance, if you work in the sports industry, take a photo in a stadium. If you work for a university, take a photo in front of the school’s main building or statue. This immediately places you in context and makes you memorable. ( : It’s okay if you don’t want to include a photo for privacy reasons, but if you’re going to post a picture, make sure it’s a good one.) Another smart way to perk up your profile is to add some . If you travel frequently, try TripIt, which enables you to share your travel itineraries and potentially set up appointments and build deeper relationships with LinkedIn connections in the cities you visit. If you’re a visual type, consider SlideShare or Google Presentation, which allow you to add presentations to your profile. I also love the Reading List by Amazon, which invites you to post books you’re reading and share your reviews with your LinkedIn connections. The overall goal of adding more applications is to give people as many reasons as possible to find something in common with you. As the manager of a LinkedIn group, I’ve noticed that my group has some “stars” -- people who consistently post thoughtful, engaging comments and draw the attention and admiration of other group members. There’s no reason you can’t be one of those stars. All it takes is a commitment to share interesting and relevant articles, to comment on popular discussions, to help people when they ask for advice or ideas and to respond to group who comment on any discussions you begin. Think of posting a discussion in a LinkedIn group as the online version of hosting a table at a conference luncheon. When you’re the host, you get to know everyone and you gain the credibility and respect of being a leader. What other ways have you found to perk up your LinkedIn profile?

We’re very excited to announce the launch of , which delivers the day’s top news, tailored to you based on what your connections and industry peers are reading and sharing. If you only have five minutes to catch up on news, LinkedIn Today can help you cut through all the clutter, so you can discover the top headlines you need to read to be better informed everyday. LinkedIn Today is unique because it gives you three social views of professional news that don’t exist together in one place anywhere else on the web. We can deliver news that matter to your connections, your industry peers, and the wider professional audience. You know and trust most of your connections and coworkers, so if they share an article, it’s a good signal that it’s something you should be paying attention to. By looking at the news articles being shared across your network and is sharing it, we can highlight the top stories you should be paying attention to. Second, LinkedIn Today can surface the top few stories you need to read today to be informed on what’s happening in your industry or the industries you care about (for e.g. ). We’ve heard from a lot of users that they may work in one industry, but they pay attention to news across multiple industries. For example, maybe they need to stay informed on the industries of their clients, or maybe they closely follow news in the industry they want to work in next. By following industries, you can get the relevant news on your Front Page and in the top navigation.  We’ll also send you a weekly email of the top industry headlines across all of the industries you follow. And, no matter how many industries you follow, we will only send you one news email per week.  Take advantage of the wisdom of the (professional) crowd, and see how news is trending across industries. Let’s say you find a story that’s one of the top stories in the Internet Industry – LinkedIn Today can also show you what other industries are sharing and discussing this story to help you connect the dots about the news. Another unique aspect of LinkedIn today is the ability to follow multiple industries, and then find the top news across all of those industries in one place.  Let’s say you work in the internet industry, and sell to customers in the healthcare industry. With LinkedIn Today, you can follow all of the industries that you care about (Internet, staffing & recruiting, and healthcare), and then come to one place to get all of your news. Within any story that’s being shared, you can drill down to see who’s shared a given headline.  We’ll show you the professional identity of the users who shared the story, along with what they are saying to get a sense of the conversation happening around a given article.   You can even narrow your results with filters like industry and company.  Only LinkedIn gives you this layer of professional identity and search capability on who’s sharing or tweeting an article. We are very excited to announce that LinkedIn Today is launching as part of the LinkedIn iPhone app as well. A lot of professionals read news on the go, so we wanted to have an easy way for users to get the top of the day, wherever they are.

A single platform eliminates the need to reinvent the wheel for: Once done this enables rapid iteration on many different recommendation products for our users, and iterate we did. Over the course of 2010, we released several different products and laid the foundation for many more to come. Here is a quick walk-through of three of those major products that utilize the recommendation engine: LinkedIn Groups provide a venue for professionals to share insights and discuss ideas relevant to their professional interests. With millions of active groups, finding groups relevant to your interests can be an exercise in keyword searching. This feature solves this problem by recommending groups relevant to you. We accomplish this by building a virtual profile per group by selecting the most representative features of group members using Information Theory techniques like and . We then map the user’s attributes to the group’s virtual profile to generate a list of recommended groups. We top this off by adding more recommendations based on collaborative filtering. “Everyone’s looking for an opportunity, even if they don’t know it”. Wise words from a recruiter that inspired , which surfaces job recommendations based on your profile features, behavior, location and attributes of people like you. We released the product on the Jobs homepage, where it got sufficient traction that we moved it to the LinkedIn homepage. Though the feature is still in beta, we are proud and enthused with the results thus far. \"Jobs you may be interested in\" continues to evolve in different ways: for e.g. it powers the “Work with us at Google” widget on the profile of Google employees (see and screenshot below), recommending jobs to the user. Our team's , this feature helps connect job posters, both small businesses to larger companies, with the most relevant talent. Given a job posting, there could be hundreds or thousands of potential candidates for the job. We use a hybrid of Content and Collaborative Filtering approaches to bubble up the best candidates in real time (matches are shown before you even finish posting the job). Making this product work involved many challenges such as standardizing job titles (e.g. technical yahoo == software engineer) and standardizing company names (BING search == Microsoft); separating skills and salient phrases from resume fillers using ; and cranking the prediction wheel using to name a few. The cherry on top is that this all happens in Try posting a and see the magic unroll.  These are just a few examples of products that speak to the power of building a common platform to rapidly iterate on data collection, modeling, and A/B testing across multiple products. Improving relevance across these multiple products will continue to remain a focus for us in 2011.

And recently, I had a chance to make my dreams become a reality. After working for LinkedIn’s Finance team for more than three years, an opportunity came up to pursue a lifelong ambition at the company of my dreams, though it would mean switching career paths. LinkedIn gave me a chance to move from my former position to join the Food & Employee Services team managing LinkedIn’s food program. Of course, this was a no-brainer for me. I couldn't resist the opportunity to follow my passion and fulfill my dream of pursuing a career in the food industry. [gallery] LinkedIn, like other companies here in the Silicon Valley, offers perks like free food to our employees. But with free food comes a responsibility to include a balanced and healthy menu each day. And, I get to live out my culinary dreams by working with food vendors, chefs and caterers to help provide exactly that - a balanced assortment of food, beverages and snacks - to our employees. I am working with a health and wellness manager, , to create a healthier food program for our employees, which includes labels to educate employees about nutrition and the use of Metabolic Typing as the nutritional philosophy, along with an emphasis on whole, natural, and unprocessed foods. Well, it starts with figuring out which catered meals to bring in and serve to employees each day. We serve about 850 catered meals a day for employees at our on-site cafe. When working with our vendors, I try to accommodate a variety of tastes – by polling everyone from our team of engineers to our executives on our LinkedIn Groups page. We have sushi every Tuesday, bagels and doughnuts for breakfast on Friday mornings, and Indian and Korean bowls are delivered weekly. Working at LinkedIn has also allowed me to grow my passion outside of work. In June of 2010, my girlfriend Angela and I started a catering and events business called Calidogs. We’ve taken an all-American classic -- the hot dog, and infused different flavors to adapt to local Bay Area culinary tastes. Some of our creations include the Calidog, made with Japanese-inspired flavors such as roasted seaweed; and the Salsadog, made with homemade salsa ceviche. ( ) What started out as a hobby has become a grassroots business with dedicated fans on Facebook, Twitter, and of course, among LinkedIn employees. One of my personal highlights was serving my colleagues in the Mountain View office CaliDogs fresh on the spot for the first time and hearing a ton of great feedback from my colleagues across the company. What I enjoy most is the satisfaction I get when people say they enjoy my selections. There’s nothing more gratifying than hearing people tell me, “Today’s lunch was great.”"},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Tips","Company Pages","Product News","New LinkedIn Features"],"author":"Brad Mauney","title":"Discover the new LinkedIn Company Search","date":"February 25, 2011","content":"Your professional network isn’t just about the people you know, it’s also about the companies in your network and how you’re connected to them.

Could we discover what team the majority of LinkedIn professionals will be cheering for on Super Bowl Sunday? To find out, we immediately stopped searching for recipes for 7-layer dips and hot wings and logged into our database. Two pieces of data give us some insight into what team a LinkedIn member may be rooting for. First, allows anyone to filter their network’s status updates by company, industry, school and location. We used this data for all of LinkedIn’s members to algorithmically determine status updates with positive sentiment towards a team (for example: \"Go Pack Go!\"). We also assumed that members who went to school in Wisconsin or Pennsylvania are likely to be cheering for their respective team. Using these two measures of team affinity and by connecting them to the industries on our members’ profiles, we constructed the first LinkedIn Super Bowl Index! The index is on a 1-100 scale, with 1 meaning an industry is waving the Terrible Towels (Steelers fan) and 100 meaning the industry is a Cheesehead (Packers fan). A value of 50 means your industry is split between the two teams. The 1-to-100 index is then conveniently represented by locations on a 100-yard football field: In the graphic you can see that most industries are to the left of the 50-yard line (in the middle), which means that from the perspective of LinkedIn, . Currently the Packers are slight favorites to win, so it seems that LinkedIn’s prediction of a Steelers victory is going a bit against the grain.

The new version was a major overhaul from a usability standpoint, making it easier to vote, share, and interact with a poll. Our engineering team’s goals included promoting agility in code development and simplicity of operations in production. Here’s a showcase of a few of the technologies used to re-build LinkedIn Polls with insight into why we chose to employ them. Ruby is a great language for building business rules. It’s concise, highly readable and perhaps most importantly, it’s fun to program in. Polls uses Rails 3, the latest incarnation of the model-view-controller (MVC) framework for building web applications. Rails gets your web application up and running quickly with reasonable conventions. It’s fun to have an application that you can start showing people in a browser within minutes. Plus, speed of development is a very important aspect to building applications so that we can react quickly to user feedback. our users can tune and tweak. Polls uses the latest versions of the JRuby Ruby interpreter and the Glassfish application server for deployment. JRuby is a fantastic way to leverage an existing Java codebase right in your Rails application. It has saved us countless hours in engineering effort by not having to rewrite Java code in Ruby just to use it in the Polls application. On top of that, it’s very fast and leverages the years of engineering effort put into building the Java Virtual Machine. Polls uses jQuery in the browser to manipulate the document object model (DOM) and draw the entire interface.  It’s a powerful, intuitive javascript library that takes the guesswork out of building applications that run on many different browsers.  It also speeds up Polls by allowing much of the interaction to happen right in your own browser and not on the server. Polls uses Raphaël to draw the charts on the results page. On browsers that support it, Rapaël will render the graphs using SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), and on Internet Explorer, it will render the graphs using VML (Vector Markup Language).  It’s a great time saver to write the rendering logic once and not worry about support in the various browsers. Also, the graphics that Raphaël renders are also viewable on Apple’s iOS devices such as the iPad and iPhone. When code is ready to go into production on Polls, we use Capistrano to manage the deployments right from a developer’s workstation. Capistrano is great for creating reliable deployment recipes that can be customized to a particular application’s topology. Capistrano also helps us make deployments seamless, and we are able to release new code for Polls on a daily basis if necessary. If you haven’t used it already, give the new a try.

Can we repair these global problems? According to world-renowned author teacher and thinker Deepak Chopra, technology-- and LinkedIn-- has the potential to heal the planet in many ways, by fostering relationships. “I believe that technology is the manifestation of God through the human nervous system,” Deepak said. “The Internet is the new planetary mind. It’s not just connectivity. It’s nurturing relationships.” Deepak shared these insights, along with other ideas from his new book, The Soul Of Leadership: Unlocking Your Potential For Greatness, at LinkedIn’s corporate headquarters in Mountain View. According to Gallup, 20 percent of the U.S. workforce is actively disengaged-- costing the U.S. economy $380 billion a year. If you work in an environment where your colleague or your superior ignores you, your likelihood of getting disengaged goes up by 45 percent. But if colleague notices a single strength you have, your disengagement falls to less than 1 percent. The solution, Deepak says, is nurturing your colleagues. And that happens through connecting. Deepak contends that the best way to empower employees is to focus on their strengths. He cited Gallup research that shows that the four most important things people expect of their leaders are hope, compassion, trust and stability. He spoke about how good leaders take calculated risks that comes from a deeper understanding of context, meaning and relationship. The most important thing, Deepak said, is living up to your values, being responsible for feedback and maintaining good health. “If you focus on success, you’ll have stress,” Deepak said. “But if you pursue excellence, success will be guaranteed.”"},{"post_categories":["Engineering","New LinkedIn Features"],"author":"Ali Imam","title":"Visualize your LinkedIn network with InMaps","date":"January 24, 2011","content":"If you’re a LinkedIn user, you already know the power of your professional network. What if you could visualize what your network looks like?  Would your connections form clusters or groups?  Wouldn’t it be great if you could see the way all your connections are related to each other? Even be able to identify the elusive hubs between your professional worlds? Now, you can! This week, we’re introducing a new LinkedIn Labs product, called InMaps. More after the jump. InMaps is an interactive visual representation of your professional universe that answers all of the above questions.  It’s a great way to understand the relationships between you and your entire set of LinkedIn connections. With it you can better leverage your professional network to help pass along job opportunities, seek professional advice, gather insights, and more. Here’s how it works: your map is color-coded to represent different affiliations or groups from your professional career, such as your previous employer, college classmates, or industries you’ve worked in. In my InMap, my LinkedIn colleagues are blue, while my former colleagues at Yahoo Analytics are pink and other at Yahoo are green and my Carnegie Mellon classmates are orange and tangerine. Bigger names represent people who are the most connected within that specific cluster or group. When you click on a contact within a circle you’ll see their profile pop up on the right, as well as lines highlighting how they’re connected to your connections. Here’s where it gets interesting. Your map is actually a view into how your professional world has been created over time. To get a sense of how that’s true, label each cluster (color) and explore your connections to see who are the major bridges on your map. You can use those insights to measure your own impact or influence, or create opportunities for someone else. So, you might see two distinct groups that you could introduce to become one. Or, you might leverage one person to connect them to someone else. See an area that doesn’t look like it is representative of your professional world? Fix it by adding the necessary connections. Just like snowflakes, no two networks are the same. Not convinced?  Share your InMap with friends and colleagues via Linkedin, Twitter, or Facebook (your contacts’ names will not be included).

Do you have others to share? on when you prefer to ask for a promotion. Does the best time to be promoted vary around the world? Again, we turn to the data of millions of our international members. In the US, while January is the top month for promotions, the spread throughout the year is more uniform than the global average. That’s good news for US professionals who have missed the January wave, especially since more than 98% of US companies . Other countries show their own distinctive character. In France (as in the rest of southern Europe), the promotion data reflects the traditional August vacation and the corresponding September surge. In Australia, we see a peak in July -- the beginning of their fiscal year. In India, the fiscal year begins in April, leading to the unique result that April trumps January as the most popular month for promotions there.

If you’re like most people, it’s probably scattered across a half dozen Word documents on your computer; or maybe your old laptop; actually, you may even have to search the sent mail folder of your email to find it. It’s probably out of date and the thought of updating it and fighting with formatting issues makes you groan. And after all the effort you put into it, it still never looks right. It’s 2011: why don’t we have a better solution? Challenge accepted. I took on the resume problem as a “hackday” project. LinkedIn holds hackday competitions once per month to encourage employees to work on – well, just about anything. Got a great idea for a new product? Build it. Think some new technology is better than what we currently have? Try it out. Spend a lot of time complaining about some issue? Put your money where your mouth (or keyboard) is and fix it. The format is simple and informal: form teams, code up a storm, and then show off the results to the rest of the company. The best hacks – as determined by a panel of judges (such as the CEO, VP of engineering, and various directors) as well as by popular vote – win prizes and become real products. The idea for my hackday project was simple: create a tool that will take the contents of you LinkedIn profile and automatically convert them into a resume. The key features: In short, you can produce a beautiful resume in just a couple of mouse clicks. And since it is online, you always know where to find it! Check out some samples: , , and . The Resume Builder project won the hackday prize for “most likely to ship”, so the next step was to try it out on our experimental site, .

This happened just one day before the announcement that the iconic leader was to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Such encounters with history are rare, so I was thrilled to learn, just last week, that our CEO Jeff Weiner would have an opportunity to interview Dr. King’s son and daughter during their tour of Silicon Valley. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oZxoHICaPs&fmt=22] Dr. King’s message has influenced me and my family a great deal, and his influence on the world, especially America, cannot be overstated. Today, we are decades removed from the climate he fought to change, and there are many with no direct personal experience of the challenges that King faced and the massive obstacles in his path. During the visit of Dr. King’s two children, what really struck me was that Dr King’s legacy is still very much alive in the hearts and minds of many Americans, even a generation removed from the people he affected directly. The event drew a packed audience of over three hundred people in person who were all on the edges of their chairs, and another hundred and fifty watching it remotely via video stream from our various offices across the globe. Dr. King’s continued relevance is undeniable, as we cannot overstate the value of preaching peace, non-violence and compassion. His son, Martin III, related a story to us about the time his father was being held in Birmingham jail, at the height of the civil rights movement. Rather than return the antagonism the guards directed at him, Dr. King chose to try and relate to them, by discussing their frustration over their low wages. He always tried to find common ground, even with people who treated him poorly. His universal empathy is a model for dissipating conflict and finding those elements that unite us. Dr. King’s daughter, Bernice, also spoke about her father’s compassion as it pertained to leadership. He famously responded to criticism by stating that even if no one else was committed to nonviolence, he would continue to embrace it. His devotion inspired others to set aside their differences, and in bringing people together, he built synergy where there had been only discord. Carrying on her father’s philosophy of involvement, she advocated using social media to organize and affect change. Some, like Malcolm Gladwell, that social media in activism generates a sort of passivity causing many to refrain from more traditional modes of demonstration. Ms. King disagrees with this view, comparing those who participate through social media alone to those who, in the past, may have simply handed out flyers. She argues that technology has only increased the power of casual activists, without damping the energy or resolve of those more committed to a cause. She contends, in fact, that the hard-won progress of the civil rights movement could have been achieved much faster using the platforms available today, with their potential for rapid and widespread mobilization of individuals. The question is, then, what can we do to further Dr. King’s vision, to help realize the future he struggled to foster? King was a transformative figure; he took the necessary steps to initiate the reforms he sought. But how? His children think it was all about the way he interacted with others. Martin shared that one of his father’s true skills was in creating a  network of people who worked together in support of a common goal. Dr King was great at building relationships and connecting people, and leveraging those talents really helped him drive change. At LinkedIn, we strive to do much the same thing, offering professionals a framework that gives them the power to affect change for themselves, and actively engage in shaping the world around them."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn API"],"author":"Mike Repass","title":"Find Your Best Path to \"Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For\" with Company Insider","date":"January 20, 2011","content":"In October 2010, LinkedIn announced for integrating LinkedIn content across the web.  Since then, we've seen rapid adoption of our new and widgets for websites and application looking to integrate more deeply into the LinkedIn platform.

A few months ago, I began noticing how many video links appeared on my LinkedIn homepage: TED talks, demos, tips and tricks -- things most effectively conveyed via video. I decided to hack a solution. Each month, LinkedIn sets aside a day for employees to experiment with and build technology that is not formally slated for development.  Sometimes Hackdays have themes, but ultimately everyone is free to build anything they deem valuable.  Some people work by themselves, some form teams. The technology that emerges from Hackdays can range from useful and pragmatic to awe inspiring, and even controversial.  The hacks are presented in front of a panel of judges and, in some cases, a winning hack is integrated into LinkedIn Labs or LinkedIn.com.

First, with enough time and hard work, there’s no limit to what you can learn. Also, no matter how complex a problem is, if you really focus you have a good chance of solving it. Most importantly, if you want to be exceptional at what you do, you have to love what you’re doing. I did enjoy my time as a surgeon, performing over 300 operations at the medical university in my hometown of Tianjin, China. I specialized in oncology, so there were long hours and many heartbreaking cases. The real problem for me, though, was that I just wasn't inspired by it. From the time I was 2 years old, my family expected me to be a doctor. When I was old enough, I followed the path into medicine, but I had already found my true passion in technology. Growing up, my favorite hobbies all centered on my computer; I was able to build websites and set up gaming competitions that spanned the whole country. It was a very big deal for me at the time, and I never lost that enthusiasm, even though my career choice was leading me elsewhere. In China, once you complete medical school, it’s almost guaranteed that you will spend your entire career in medicine. There is a proverb, though, that says you can never be great at a job you do not love. For that reason, I knew that medicine would never let me realize my true potential. I shocked my family when I announced, after two years in the field, that I was leaving the hospital. I couldn’t see myself doing it for the rest of my life, so I promptly quit, and began learning English. I knew that to pursue my dream in the way that I wanted, I would have to come to the U.S., and so that’s what I did. I accepted a position as a database intern and began teaching myself analytics from scratch, watching the people who were building models and learning everything I could from them. I like data. I like logic. Working in medicine, you have to build up a tremendous amount of knowledge, so it’s there when you need to use it. In analytics, I’ve found a whole new way to apply that approach. I’ve been able to explore the potential of datamining, which offers a much faster turnaround for applying information. Since I’ve been at LinkedIn, I’ve been very impressed by how quickly my efforts pay off. Most of my work here involves helping our marketing or sales teams make use of our massive database, by building models and straightforward  interfaces that save them valuable research time. We put these models together very fast, and can often get substantial feedback in the first weeks of a project’s development. It’s very exciting to see results that soon, because we have a wealth of information and we’ve only begun to scratch the surface for innovative ways to use it. LinkedIn has an unprecedented perspective that spans almost every industry, and we have enough data to potentially track and anticipate a slew of trends, from to tracking and . There’s almost no limit to what we can do. I don’t consider myself a statistician, though, looking only at numbers since I get to see how what I do helps move the business  forward. Much of that insight comes from principles I learned while pursuing my MBA, and an understanding of how it all fits together is a major part of what motivates me. As much as I enjoy my analytic projects for their own sake, nothing compares to the sense of accomplishment that comes from contributing to the company as a whole. Simply put, I came here because I want to be a better analyst. Working at LinkedIn sharpens my skill set a little more each day, and I’m thankful for the challenge and the opportunity to learn. Like a neurosurgeon, an analyst has to work hard to stay on top of what’s new, to make sure he has the best available tools to do his job. I get that here, and at the same time I get to provide the best available tools for over 85 million professionals on LinkedIn today, letting them stay on top of what’s new in their professions. I know I’m always at the forefront at LinkedIn, and I get to see the fruits of my labor as we improve every day."},{"post_categories":["Engineering"],"author":"Jun Rao","title":"Open-sourcing Kafka, LinkedIn's distributed message queue","date":"January 11, 2011","content":"  We are pleased to open-source another piece of infrastructure software developed at LinkedIn, , a persistent, efficient, distributed message queue. Kafka is primarily intended for tracking various activity events generated on LinkedIn's website, such as pageviews, keywords typed in a search query, ads presented, etc. Those activity events are critical for monitoring user engagement as well as improving relevancy in various other products. Each day, a substantially large number of such events are generated. Therefore, we need a solution that's scalable and incurs low overhead. We first looked at several existing queuing solutions in the market. The most popular ones are based on JMS. Although JMS offers a rich set of features, it also adds significant overhead in the message representation. Additionally, some JMS implementations are optimized for the case when all messages can be cached in memory and their performance starts to degrade significantly when the in-memory buffer is saturated. Finally, most existing solutions don't have a clean design for scaling out. That's why we decided to build Kafka. In summary, Kafka has the following three design principles: (1) a very simple API for both producers and consumers; (2) low overhead in network transferring as well as on-disk storage; (3) a scaled out architecture from the beginning. More details on the technical aspect of Kafka can be found . Today, Kafka has been used in production at LinkedIn for a number of projects. There are both offline and online usage. In the offline case, we use Kafka to feed all activity events to our data warehouse and Hadoop, from which we then run various batch analysis. In the online case, a service will consume events in real time. For example, in LinkedIn , Kafka is used to deliver all network updates to our search engine. Typically , an update becomes searchable within a few seconds after it is posted. The design of Kafka allows us to use a single infrastructure to support events delivery for both cases. We feel that Kafka can be very useful in many places outside of LinkedIn. By open sourcing it, we hope to work with people in the community to keep improving Kafka in the future. We welcome comments and suggestions from everybody."},{"post_categories":["New LinkedIn Features"],"author":"Jimmy Chen","title":"Naughty or Nice?

Along with our recently launched , both programs give the quantitative and qualitative data that helps to provide a true “apples-to-apples” comparison opportunity to augment valuable Recommendations received on LinkedIn. We are excited to have developed and launched a new application integrated in LinkedIn: , for legal professional members to leverage their ratings on their LinkedIn profiles: 1. Lawyers who display their ratings on and can now use this ratings application to extend the visibility of hard-earned, third-party recognition from peers and clients to an online audience of millions of fellow members within LinkedIn. 2. The application will also allow their clients another convenient channel to complete a Martindale Hubbell Client Review directly on LinkedIn. This is our first application for LinkedIn, and our vision is to see it grow, extending its value with new dynamic content in the future and allowing legal professionals to connect in a whole new way via LinkedIn. Please let us know what you think! Just go to the under “More” and click on the link. Each lawyer will go through a simple verification process, and within minutes can showcase their ratings on their LinkedIn profile."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Developer Network"],"author":"Guest Author","title":"LinkedIn’s FT Press app helps you showcase your business reading","date":"December 2, 2010","content":"Our Linkedin application, eBookshelf by FT Press helps busy professionals find trustworthy information and answers quickly to help them do their job better and advance their career.  We’ve developed a series of over 500 shorts - essential reading for business success that covers a wide variety of networking topics.

In this environment, we were really excited to be one of the first users on LinkedIn’s recently launched Company Pages. In recent times, knowledge workers have begun using social technologies at work for knowledge sharing both within and across peer networks. We think LinkedIn’s Company Pages is a perfect example of such a social tool that helps amplify word of mouth for companies.  It's still early days, but here's what we've found so far (after the jump). In just a couple of weeks, we’ve had great results: An endorsement is much more meaningful when it comes, unprompted, from someone who has actually used the product. And, this is where social features like Company Pages are helping companies build community around their services. They’re a simple way for people with shared interests to offer relevant recommendations to their business network. This recommendation is even more valuable on a site like LinkedIn that’s based on your professional identity. We know it means something when your endorsement includes your picture, name, title, company, written testimonial that you choose to share with your network. We think that as the community on our LinkedIn Company Page grows, the element of serendipity will increase. When you and discover that a friend or colleague you trust has already endorsed us, your trust in the product or service is further amplified. That's a valuable and trusted form of recommendation much like the instant familiarity you feel when introduced to a new person by a friend. The cool thing is that this model is actually better for consumers too. By seeing who recommends a product and what they’re saying, these recommendations help business people find products that are right for them. And, they can quickly reach out and get further information from their network of connections. It’s good for small businesses and vendors like us since it forces us to design products and services that are super useful, intuitive and engaging. These days, word of mouth marketing happens really fast, across networks, at scale. Companies that focus on customer delight to drive the positive feedback loop of endorsement will keep doing better. and let us know what you think!

This means that recruiters from these organizations -- some of the largest and most respected companies in the world -- are engaging with LinkedIn every day to find and vet job candidates. If you’re looking for a job right now, then you’re probably wondering, “How do I get these top corporate recruiters (and others) to find while they’re searching on LinkedIn?” Here are some tips that will help you reach recruiters and stand out from the crowd: To find these magic words, research the profiles of people who have the job you want as well as the job listings for the positions you desire. What words show up the most frequently in both places? These are probably some of the keywords recruiters are using. For example, if you are interested in a job selling advertising for websites, look at the LinkedIn profiles of people who have job titles such as “online advertising manager” or “director of interactive sales.” Then, find the words that appear commonly in these profiles, such as “digital ad sales,” “online advertising,” “new media” or “web sales.” Smart job seekers then sprinkle these words throughout their own profiles (assuming they accurately reflect your skills and experience, of course). Good places to include keywords in your LinkedIn profile are in your profile title, the Summary section, the Specialties area and throughout the descriptions beneath each position you list in your Experience section. To find out which groups would be best for you to join and engage in, again check out the profiles of people you admire in your industry and see what groups those people belong to. And, of course, look at the profiles of recruiters at the companies where you’d like to work and see what groups belong to. Then apply to join these groups and, if you are accepted (some groups require particular credentials but many are open), jump in and post discussion topics, share and comment on relevant industry articles and provide advice or guidance to people who post questions.  Don’t go overboard here -- no need to comment on every single discussion in every group you belong to -- but focus your efforts by writing perhaps one or two well-thought-out posts a week responding to group discussions that relate to your area of expertise. And, of course, keep a special eye out for any employees of the companies you want to work for and try to engage in discussions in which they are participating. You never know when someone might take notice of your brilliance! This means that one of the best thing you can do as a job seeker is to find personal connections to a company, and LinkedIn is the perfect place to do this. Go to the LinkedIn of any organization you want to work for and see if you’re connected to anyone who currently works there or has worked there in the past. You may not even realize that you have a direct connection to your dream employer. If you discover this is the case, reach out to your connection, as long as it’s someone you are truly acquainted with -- ideally a first degree connection or a second connection with whom you share a close contact, and write a polite and concise LinkedIn message asking that person if he or she would be willing to share some advice on landing a job at that organization. Once you’ve taken this advice, you might also go back and ask that helpful contact to personally pass along your resume or application to the right person in HR. There are no guarantees when it comes to asking people for help on LinkedIn, but I’ve found that people will generally respond well to a request that is gracious and comes from a friend or a friend-of-a-trusted-friend. Some companies even compensate their employees for bringing in new hires, so you might be helping yourself your contact. Have you found other ways to attract the attention of recruiters on LinkedIn?

At Dell, we also see this as an incredible opportunity to continue building more powerful relationships with our customers. As a pioneer in the online space, we’ve been active in social commerce and support for some time with our Ratings & Reviews site housed on Dell.com, our activity on Twitter and Business Solutions Exchange group on LinkedIn – all places where customers can easily share experiences and learn from the knowledge of their peers.

Music has always been a passion of mine and CC Mixter, an online music community gave me the support I needed to learn and grow as an artist. Since joining LinkedIn’s Talent Acquisition Team, I keep coming back to this idea of following one's passion, and the way a supportive, authentic community can help make that happen. I think about the people who encouraged me to explore recruiting and HR, in different industries and in different parts of the country and world. I benefited from the knowledge and advice of others. That’s something I believe LinkedIn can help professionals achieve at a massive scale. It’s hard to find many parallels, so I’ll just say it plainly: I get to be part of the company that is changing the face of my profession. Because of LinkedIn, the recruiting team at LinkedIn isn’t just business as usual: cold-calls to possible matches for job openings. We’re developing real, ongoing relationships with people who will be great matches at some point in time, even if that time is not now. In addition, what makes this recruiting role at LinkedIn truly unique for me  is that we are both the customer and consumer of our product. As a result, we truly collaborate with all parts of the company -- from product roadmap and product ideas, to participation in business strategy discussions. Such an opportunity is extremely rare. In 2009, Deloitte published work that stated: Why does passion matter? Because staying competitive in the newly globalized labor market requires all of us to constantly renew and update our professional skills and capabilities. The effort required to increase our rate of professional development is difficult to muster unless we are passionately engaged with our professional activities. I am a huge believer in passion as a differentiator, both personally and professionally. And, my role in LinkedIn has enabled me to take my creativity, love of recruiting and joy in building something special into another dimension. You only need to look at an event like InDays — a monthly event we organize at LinkedIn where all LinkedIn employees create projects for LinkedInLabs, bring in speakers on crowdsourced topics, and mobilize around causes or ideas — to see the variety and diversity of interests and passions around the LinkedIn offices.  The people here, their willingness to engage, learn, explore, in and out of the office, truly sets LinkedIn apart.

Starting today, group managers can adjust user permissions to determine an approval process  before that content is displayed. This allows group managers to weed out spam before it pollutes your groups conversation stream. Managers now have highly granular control over the type of content requiring moderation, and they can determine the duration of a “trial period” by setting the number of days a new member has to be in the group before being able to post freely. The flexibility of this new tool will also apply to digest emails that group members have signed up to receive each week. Group managers and moderators can screen content submissions from the new \"Submissions Queue\" under the group's Manage tab. From there the individual content item can be deleted, approved, or moved to Promotions or Jobs. As the manager evaluates content, the individual contributor can be removed from the group, left in their current permission level, or allowed to post freely from that moment. As a group member, you can always see which of your group submissions are still pending by going to your Activity page for the group and clicking on \"Pending Submissions\". Remember that you can always get to your groups' \"Activity\" page from the \"More\" dropdown in the group's navigation bar or by clicking your own profile image in a group discussion. The usual 15-minute edit window applies to a submission, in case you need to edit what you've shared. Users can also check submissions via the convenient \"View my pending comments\" link located at the top of of any thread awaiting manager approval.

Making intelligent recommendations helps define your professional persona as an influencer and helps you build credibility with potential employers, partners and colleagues. Most importantly, it offers additional value to your network of connections who may be looking for your recommendation before they make their next purchase. For companies, both large brands as well as small businesses, Company pages now allows you to showcase recommendations from your customers and helps build your brand virally and credibly on LinkedIn.

The most recent statistics from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics show a worsening employment situation among veterans. In these challenging economic times we dug into our data to see if we could identify useful insights relevant for veterans. We also put together a list of LinkedIn tips for veterans, from veterans who work at LinkedIn. There are nearly half a million LinkedIn members with U.S. military service listed on their profile. For these veterans, here are the top 10 industries in terms of the total number of LinkedIn members currently working in that industry: What’s interesting about the above list is that most veterans are taking their specialized skill sets and applying them to a wide range of industries (most of which are not immediately associated with the military). It’s a good reminder that a veteran’s skills are broadly applicable. As an example of the diverse skill sets we know our veterans can apply, here are a few members of our own team at LinkedIn who have served. When we dug deeper into the data we wondered why we didn’t see some of the traditional industries that might have been expected. Once we normalized the data for the top 10 non-military and non-defense industries in terms of the more traditional industries pop up: What does the above chart say when taken together with the first one? It paints a picture of another great networking opportunity for veterans. The high share of veterans in each of these industries suggests that veterans also look into directly transferring their military skill set into one of the above-related professions. Along that direction we also identified the top locations for networking with other veterans. The graphic below shows the top 10 metropolitan areas in terms of the number of people on LinkedIn who have served in the military. Even though the concentration of veterans may be higher in certain areas (for example, close to a military base), the highest volume of networking opportunities is in the major metropolitan areas. Finally, on a day honoring our veterans, here are our tips for veterans that are looking to get the most out of LinkedIn: 1. - Make sure your LinkedIn network is made up of at least 35 connections. Connect with current and former soldiers, sailors and Marines, college classmates, former co-workers and even friends and family since they know professionals in other industries. 2. - Join military related groups on LinkedIn so you can network and share best practices with one another. The five largest military related groups on LinkedIn are: , , , and . Also find and join groups that are focused on industry topics you’re interested in like “ ” or “ ”. Get creative and join groups about topics you are passionate about. 3. - Make sure your is 100 percent complete and include descriptive phrases your work experience like the kinds of teams you were responsible for, programs you enacted that helped increase effectiveness, what countries you worked in, etc. Professionals use to search for keywords like “engineering,” or “government consulting.\"  Highlight your abilities in developing leaders, building strong teams, and overcoming difficult challenges. Include the units you served with and the ships you were aboard to help other veterans find you.  If this info isn’t in your profile then clients, peers and potential employers won’t find you and you may be missing out on opportunities. 4. - Use to find mentors if you’re looking to do a complete career switch. If you’re want to become a photographer, lawyer or sales executive do a search by title for people that currently hold those positions and are based near your zip code. Reach out to them to see if they’d be willing to give you tips and advice on getting into that profession. You can also use this technique to search for recruiters and hiring managers that live in your city or a city you’d be interested in moving to. Click on the person’s profile and you’ll see if anyone in your network knows them and can introduce you. 5. - LinkedIn makes it easy for professionals to follow and stay updated on senior level changes and new hires at companies you care about. Search for your dream employers’ company page and click \"Follow Company\" to get regular updates on hiring, promotions, departures and job listings as soon as they happen."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Tips"],"author":"Lindsey Pollak","title":"5 Ways to Make the Most of LinkedIn","date":"October 18, 2010","content":"As a career expert and LinkedIn ambassador, I hear the same question over and over again: “ ” Well, you’ve come to the right place! LinkedIn is a powerful way to establish a online identity, build a professional network, and manage your career. But just like in the real world, it’s important to be action-oriented. Here are some tips, based on my experience, that have proven successful for people with a wide variety of career objectives: As with other popular social networks, LinkedIn offers you the opportunity to share brief status updates with your connections or followers. Because LinkedIn is a network, you want to make sure your updates are totally professional, too.  I think of my status updates like brief conversations I would have at networking events: “I just read a really interesting article you might enjoy” or “I’m attending our industry conference next week. Are you going too?”  You never know what nugget might catch someone’s attention and spark a conversation or opportunity. I once updated my status to let my network know that I was on my way out to Los Angeles from New York. By the time my flight landed, I had a message on my voice mail from a news producer in LA who had seen my LinkedIn update and asked if I could be a guest on his show the next day. Of course I said yes (and updated my status to invite my network to watch the segment!). I love the advice of Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, who recommends using the site to do “small goods” for other people. I often congratulate my contacts when they mention a new job or client, write a quick answer to a question someone in my industry has posted in the Answers section of LinkedIn or click “like” on an article one of my connections has shared. Networking is best when it’s mutually beneficial, so use LinkedIn to help others and they’re likely to help you in return. Dan, a recent college grad from Illinois, shared the following story with me: “As I approached graduation and a daunting career search during a turbulent economy, I applied for an entry-level program at a prestigious company. Shortly after, I searched for the company on LinkedIn and noticed that my previous supervisor had worked there and happened to know the college recruiting manager.\" “I quickly contacted my previous supervisor and asked for permission to reach out to her. Instead, she wrote a letter of endorsement to the manager and within two days I had a phone interview set up.” If Dan hadn’t searched for this potential employer on LinkedIn, he never would have known he had a great connection just waiting to be tapped. Imagine what connections you might have that you don’t know about. Find out by researching every potential employer or networking lead on LinkedIn. I frequently ask recruiters to share their dos and don’ts for job seekers hoping to work at their companies. One “don’t” comes up over and over again: almost every recruiter tells me that his or her biggest pet peeve is when candidates haven’t done their homework about the company where they’re applying for a position. “Don’t ask me to tell you what my company does,” said one recruiter friend of mine. “It’s your job to find out before you apply here!” While your first stop in researching an organization is that company’s own website, your next destination should be . Click on “Follow Company” for each organization you’d like to work for and you’ll receive every update that company shares on LinkedIn -- new job postings, new hires, promotions and more. Next, scour the company’s page and click through to the profiles of the employees featured there. How do they describe their jobs? What keywords do they use? What LinkedIn groups do they belong to? What connections do you have to these people? The more you know about an employer and its employees, the more likely you’ll be to get a foot in the door. I’m not sure why, but when certain people log in to social networking websites, they forget that there are other human beings on the other side of those profiles, posts and messages. Just because you’re interacting through the computer doesn’t mean you should act any differently than you would if you were networking in person. Be polite, authentic and positive. Say please and thank you. Personalize your connection requests and messages so your correspondence doesn’t feel like spam. And if you wouldn’t do it, say it or share it in person, don’t do it, say it or share it on LinkedIn. Above all, remember that LinkedIn is a powerful tool for professionals who are looking to discover opportunities and accelerate their careers. Good luck, and see you on LinkedIn!"},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Developer Network"],"author":"Guest Author","title":"Connecting LinkedIn users to Seesmic Desktop","date":"October 20, 2010","content":"is a popular social client that allow users to easily access their social networks in one application and successfully manage their online presence.

You can share a new article from your iPhone or re-share an article from your connection by tapping on ‘Post to Updates’.  If you have on LinkedIn, you will also be able to cross post to your Twitter account at the same time. We received a lot of feedback from our users that viewing Connection updates is an important part of your daily activity, so you’ll be pleased that we've added a Connection tab that shows who your connections have recently connected with. The toggle switch in Settings for Connection Updates is still available and toggles whether your Connection Updates shows up in the All tab or not.

LinkedIn features in Hotmail will start to roll out today and over the course of the next 3 weeks, depending on your location. We love LinkedIn’s tag line, “Relationships Matter,” because at Windows Live, our goal is to create great experiences that keep you connected with the people who matter most. With over 75 million professionals in over 200 countries and a new user joining approximately every second, LinkedIn is clearly a leader in professional social networking that we’re excited to partner with. There are four key areas we’re focused on in our deep integration with LinkedIn: We recognize how tedious it is to manually clean up duplicate contacts in your contact list, but it’s important that you have easy access to the right contact information for the right situation. For example, when you send a work-related email, you may use a different email address than when you send a personal note to the same person. When you make the LinkedIn connection with Windows Live, your LinkedIn contacts are automatically linked to the same contact you already have stored in Windows Live, so that you have one record with the combined set of information. Now you can compose and send email to your LinkedIn contacts right from Hotmail. Having your LinkedIn contacts connected to Windows Live doesn’t end with just email, however. Your LinkedIn contacts are available to you across Windows Live, including the Photo Gallery. You probably wouldn’t think to associate photos with your LinkedIn activities, but with in Photo Gallery, for example, you could tag a photo of someone you saw at a conference, because it’s always helpful to put a face to a name. When you’ve connected LinkedIn with Messenger, news from your colleagues will be added to your Messenger social updates. Just like with your existing Messenger, Facebook, and MySpace friends, you can choose to make any LinkedIn contact a favorite so their updates get prioritized in Messenger highlights. Here’s an example: …and of course, it works on your mobile devices such as the iPhone as well: And, when you comment on social updates, your comments post right back to LinkedIn. This is consistent across the web and iPhone Messenger app as well, so you’re always connected, even while on the go. We also make it easy for you to use Messenger and the rest of Windows Live to automatically show your LinkedIn contacts what you’re doing and sharing, even if they don’t use Windows Live. If you choose to have your Windows Live activities shared out to LinkedIn, then when you update your status in Messenger or Hotmail, or upload photos and documents that you’ve set permissions to Everyone or Friends for in SkyDrive , these updates are posted to LinkedIn: Of course, you have complete control over which features you want to connect. Just select the features you want: Finally, you can easily choose to have your LinkedIn activities (like status updates and job changes—always interesting information from LinkedIn contacts) shared with your Messenger friends, if they don’t happen to use LinkedIn yet.

We’re also making it easier than ever for group moderators to delete inappropriate posts with one-click right from the email alerts of the discussions you follow in your group. In a coming release, managers and moderators can also remove, block, and delete not just one email thread but all contributions of the offending spammer right from these emails. 4. You don’t have to take on the work of moderating your group alone. Deputize trusted members to help moderate so they can utilize all the great moderation features too. 5. We also wanted to make it easier for all members of your group to help you weed out spam and inappropriate content. All posts and comments flagged as inappropriate by group members will be added to the group managers' new moderation queue. In one swift move, you can delete or clear flags from posts as well as blacklist spammers with the powerful “remove member, block & delete contributions” button. 6.

This gave a huge boost to our business -- our post-groupon revenue was, on average, 63% higher than our pre-Groupon revenue over the same amount of time. You can see the initial spike in revenue in the graph below. That's to be expected after distributing a coupon. What we found even more interesting was the “new normal” that resulted. Even after the bump from Groupon, our revenue has leveled off to almost 50% higher than before. There are a few contributing factors to this, we believe. One is simply repeat customers, but the other is all of our social media efforts combining to create a viral spread of knowledge about Stone Korean Kitchen. After the Groupon bump, we got double the number of Yelp reviews each month than we had in the months prior to it. More Yelp reviews gave us added legitimacy and further boosted our ability to draw in customers. It was the online equivalent to walking by a crowded, bustling restaurant. If that many people are enjoying it, they must be on to something. While it's a lot of work to keep up with all of the activity in two such different worlds, I like how they interact with each other. I can bring my own expertise in high tech to the world of small business, and as an entrepreneur I am more aware of how much social technology increasingly now matters to small businesses around the world."},{"post_categories":["Product News","Groups","New LinkedIn Features"],"author":"Ian McCarthy","title":"Welcome to a whole new way of experiencing LinkedIn Groups","date":"June 22, 2010","content":"Starting today, we’re rolling out some updates to LinkedIn groups - the first major update since we launched discussions in Groups at the end of August 2008. This is the first of upcoming upgrades to our groups’ platform, conversation system, and moderation toolkit coming shortly. Please bear in mind that these updates will be rolled out over the next week, by when you should see these feature updates applied to . Here’s a quick video that walks you through the key features you can expect from the new LinkedIn Groups. More details after the jump. We’ve made the conversations within groups similar to face-to-face professional interactions by removing the wall between original remarks and off-site content such as shared news articles. The rich link-sharing experience you already enjoy on your LinkedIn homepage is now also available within the context of groups. Even better is the ability to easily recognize the participants of a conversation by linking to individual profile pictures that makes the experience more personal. It also brings to your finger tips profile information of the professional participating in that discussion. The new design makes it easy to browse through the latest updates of a discussion and make comments quickly and easily. You can roll over the images of the last three participants on any thread to see comment previews and click their profile pictures to jump to their segment  of the conversation. Alternatively, you can chime in right away by commenting in line without drilling down into the whole discussion. If you’re new to the thread, clicking the discussion headline or the “See all comments” link will take you to the beginning of the discussion. A key part of the new groups experience is the democratization of discussions, as group members actively curate the conversations that will be seen by the group. This is most obvious in the carousel of new content – original posts, RSS items, and off-site links shared by group members - that can be voted up or down by any group member. This feature allows users to quickly peruse new content and vote either by \"liking\" or commenting on discussions they deem worthy of the group’s attention.  Users who prefer to see all discussions sorted chronologically can just click on the “See all new discussions” link on the homepage. In a live discussion, nodding fuels a conversation and the new “Like” button is a simple way to do this virtually.  You can also see who has liked a conversation to get a sense for topics that group members are gravitating toward. The “More” drop-down in the carousel also makes it easy to flag new items as a job or as inappropriate for the group. While you may check in to groups ever so often to get the latest news and discussions from your fellow group members, you may also like to set up a persistent email alert when select members of the group make a contribution (like or comment) within the group. This is easily accomplished from the global Groups' page. Finally, the new groups interface introduces an easy way to discover participants who truly drive the activity of the group’s discussions each week by highlighting them as “top influencers”.  This designation is given not only to those who contribute the most, but also to those whose contributions stimulate the most participation from other group members. Members who are highly regarded and heavily followed in the group often play a key role in stoking the conversation with their comments and Likes even if they don’t start a thread.  Of course, the authors of popular threads are often the most influential. We’re all about nurturing the professional conversation, and we hope the changes to LinkedIn Groups will make it even easier for you to contribute and participate in a professional groups setting. We'd love to hear your feedback, so please feel free to leave a comment at the bottom of this post or @ us on Twitter."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn API"],"author":"Lucian Beebe","title":"Greater Access and More Profile Data for Developers","date":"June 25, 2010","content":" The LinkedIn Open API program has been live for 6 months now and after watching what you are building and what you need, we are announcing a wide variety of new features that target three of the most common requests and needs our developers have asked for. A vastly improved Search API that lets developers search and also process a great amount of analytical data on LinkedIn came out two weeks ago. That will let developers  build much more powerful search experiences on your site using the LinkedIn API. Major request fulfilled. Today, we're announcing another set of major improvements to developers' experience of working with the LinkedIn platform: higher throttles where you need them most, and greater access to profile data. We've made two key changes to throttles that will make it easier to develop and test developers' applications: We've increased the Search API throttle by 400%. The search throttle is now 100 searches per user per day. This should accommodate most use cases very well. While you are developing your application, it's hard to build and test without hitting some of the user throttles. Effective immediately, when you are listed as a developer on an API key, your throttle will be 4 times higher than the published user throttles for most calls. We think this is the right number, but we will be watching and listening and will respond further if necessary. It's important to remember that while the higher developer throttles apply to you as a developer of the application, they don’t apply to your users. Be careful not to build features that require the higher throttles to work. These higher developer throttles are there to help you develop and test applications. In the past, we've returned two versions of profiles: Effective now, you will get the full profile details for users who grant you access (no change there) and also for those user's connections as well. This matches the site more closely and lets you present deeper insights to your users. To access this data, simply include the fields you want in the call. For full details on the fields you get for each user, check the doc. Starting today, you can also get the text of recommendations for a profile. This was a long standing request and we're happy to get it out. You will be able to get the full text of recommendations for users who grant you access and their first degree connections. We'll look to expand this to all profiles soon."},{"post_categories":["Engineering"],"author":"Russell Jurney","title":"LinkedIn, Apache Pig, and Open Source","date":"July 1, 2010","content":"  One of the reasons I joined LinkedIn Analytics is its commitment to open source. At LinkedIn, we love open source. We’re committed to contributing to Hadoop and Pig and giving back to the open source community through projects like and . We are determined to provide the open source community with the complete and painless data cycle that we enjoy - to enable even casual hadoop users to analyze data from their application at scale, to mine it for value and store it easily and reliably so that it can drive use and close the data loop. Look for new open source tools and projects from in the coming months that will help make this possible! Hadoop drives many of our most powerful features at LinkedIn. About half of our Hadoop jobs are submitted by Apache Pig. This means that along with Azkaban and Voldemort, Pig is a large part of LinkedIn’s data cycle - the process behind features like People You May Know and Who Viewed My Profile. I have used Pig intensively for about a year. During that time, I have come to love Pig for what it enables me to do: easily manipulate my data at scale, to turn raw data into data products. If Perl is the , and Hadoop is the kernel of the , then Pig is the duct tape of . Pig lets me easily flow my data in parallel with simple commands. It lets me flow my data through dynamic languages like Python if I want to use SciPy, through simple UDFs in Java if I want to use a function repeatedly and share it with others, and ILLUSTRATE lets me check the output of my lengthy batch jobs and their custom functions without having to do a lengthy run of a long pipeline. Taken together, these features enable me to be productive. I learned Pig not because I had a big data problem, but because I wanted to build a better interface for Hadoop (see: , , , ). For a long time, I did not delve very deeply. There was no reason to do so: I didn’t have to know how to code in MapReduce - Pig ‘just worked.’ I issue SQLish commands in Pig Latin, and Pig parses these commands and creates and submits MapReduce jobs for me. This saves me from having to think too hard about the complexity of Java, MapReduce or Hadoop. I don’t like to think about anything but the problem I’m actually solving, and so while I have written Algebraic MapReduce jobs as Pig UDFs, I am unlikely to ever write a Java Hadoop job unless I absolutely have to. Apache Pig is now fairly robust, but data-flows themselves can get complex fast. I’m pretty fluent in Pig Latin, but my code in any language rarely runs on the first try. With batch computing, running jobs repeatedly to debug them can take a long time and slow development to a crawl. One must often massage the Pig to command its will. When I write Pig Latin code beyond a dozen lines, I check it in stages: When you first tackle a complex task with Pig, that last step rarely happens on the first few tries. In time, you get more proficient. As an incurious Pig user, I thought of Pig as a black box: a program with a command line. Nevertheless, I got to know the idiosyncrasies of each version as Pig matured from version 0.2 to 0.7 - unfixed bugs, unusual behaviors, and undocumented limitations. I never knew exactly why Pig behaved as it did, but I learned to get along with it. Several months ago I decided to work on the Pig project and I’m going after low hanging fruit the committers haven’t gotten around to and leaving the tough bits to them. Log analysis is a common use of Pig, and logs usually contain timestamps, so I want to add a Joda-Time DateTime data type to Pig. But that is way too hard, so I’m going after boolean first. I checked out the code. I worked on it all weekend. I made a patch. I made many patches, actually. Time and again, I thought I was done, but I wasn’t. Booleans would load in grunt, so I thought it worked - but they wouldn’t store. I added physical storage code, so I could load and store. I emailed the LinkedIn Hadoop users list proclaiming victory… but it wouldn’t work on Hadoop. So I added Hadoop storage code, and it would load and store on Hadoop - but I couldn’t use operators to check for equality. I added code for ILLUSTRATE and it would illustrate, but I still couldn’t use booleans in a real job. This went on and on, and remains a work in progress. During that weekend of long and frustrating hours of Pig hacking, the pattern became familiar. I was interacting with a different part of Pig each time I got a new kind of error. The hops from package to package in writing the patch corresponded to the stages of my long hours of stepwise data-flow checks in Grunt, as I had written Pig scripts most days over the course of the last year. From a user’s perspective using the Grunt shell, this system seems like a cohesive entity - a single program - a complete (and somewhat irrational) Pig. It doesn’t seem that way anymore. Now that I’ve read the code, using Grunt is different. Knowing the way it all fits together at a high level - by tracing exceptions and seeing the package names of classes I’ve failed to implement because I didn’t know they existed or were required - I know that pig is actually segmented into many logical parts, independent arms that verify and process Pig Latin code independently and in different ways. The interface presented by grunt presents an illusion of wholeness that a deeper understanding of pig makes transparent - clear as illusion. For me, understanding my work over the last year by understanding Pig was profound. It gave it more meaning, because strangely enough Pig has become a big part of my life. I’ve never much contributed to open source before, and I’m glad to be transitioning from a passive consumer of other people’s work to an active participant in an open source project. It is good to create openly, to give back. Open source is technical righteousness. But more than that, this is an important time in computer science, and unlike many previous technical revolutions, this one is happening completely in the open. Like the integrated circuit before it, MapReduce is producing a paradigm shift that opens broad opportunities to produce new kinds of products from our massive collective backlog of data to help people in new and unprecedented ways. At LinkedIn we’ve amassed the world’s premiere data-set on the labor of professionals, and it is the mission of LinkedIn Analytics to leverage that deeply meaningful data to provide insight and value to our users. At LinkedIn Analytics data processing is both personal and meaningful, as the features we create enhance the working lives of tens of millions of people. The Integrated Circuit solved the Tyranny of Numbers and unleashed Moore’s law, enabling a computerized, networked society. It did so with the considerable overhead of patent licensing and litigation. MapReduce is solving the Tyranny of Threads, enabling any company to process data at scale in parallel to extract real value from our most abundant and underutilized resource: information. It is doing it in the open, through free and open-source software, through the Apache Foundation, Hadoop and its sub-projects. We’ve gotten more efficient organizationally this time around.

Part of this is listening to our customers and the wider community to better understand the challenges they face and where we can improve what we do to stay relevant. A major part of our business is healthcare technology and the more we looked at building a platform to engage with professionals in this industry, the more we realised this community already existing on LinkedIn. HN: Healthcare professionals around the world discuss the latest technological developments with their peers and colleagues every day. With LinkedIn, we can bring these thousands of conversations happening worldwide onto one platform. Doctors from India to the US to Germany can now share insights and experience in an environment where we play the facilitator in an unobtrusive way. This is vital for ensuring the conversation stays focused and flows easily, delivering real benefits to our audience. HN: With the , we’ve taken a significant step in a new direction for our business-to-business marketing in moving part of that engagement off of our own website. Part of the drive behind that is the realisation that in the future 95% of the online engagement with our customers will happen off our own website. Ignoring that fact would have been a mistake and we now have an opportunity to have conversations with the five million healthcare professionals on LinkedIn in an environment that they are comfortable in and trust. HN: When it comes to any part of business, but especially something like healthcare, trust is paramount. LinkedIn is your professional identity, meaning the contribution you make is highly likely to be thoughtful and insightful. This is the environment we wanted to create to ensure its usefulness for members. If you don’t add value with these engagement efforts then you won’t get people coming back, and this is a long term investment for us. We’re still in the early stages but already seeing a great level of engagement among the group’s 11,000 plus members and this is increasing daily. HN: Firstly, this is not a short term project. Social media needs to be an ongoing, integrated element of your communications with the outside world and your marketing strategy to be genuine. Secondly, context is king. Think about the type of message you want to get to your audience and the right time to do this. Since we're focused in the professional space, Linkedin was the best choice. For other brands social networks might be more appropriate. Finally, moderation is very important. We took the decision to use well-known names in the sector to help us with this and it’s helped keep the conversations relevant and valuable for the members. HN: The group is already proving successful in bringing the right professionals together to have in-depth and valuable conversations about their respective fields. The group numbers and engagement have far exceeded our forecasts and we’re excited about the new elements we’ll be bringing in over the next weeks and months."},{"post_categories":["Product News","New LinkedIn Features"],"author":"Yassine Hinnach","title":"Meet your new LinkedIn Inbox","date":"June 8, 2010","content":"Recently, we started rolling out our new Inbox to some of our members and soon all of you will be seeing it (if you haven't already).

But thirty years ago the pioneering ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau reported that every square mile of the world's oceans is covered with a thin film of oil. It's barely visible, if at all, but it's there. Because there are seemingly endless stretches of ocean -- just as there seemed to be endless stretches of ice at the poles -- human beings could afford to pretend that we aren't living on a spaceship. That time is at an end. Technology will eventually bring us an end to fossil fuels. Water diversion can bring drinking water to the overcrowded cities where clean, potable water is quickly running out (several in India, including Mumbai, are reaching the critical point). Genetic therapies may one day bring down cancer rates by more than a trifling amount. In other words, if you are an optimist, the hazards of climate change and overpopulation are waiting for solutions that will one day emerge, hopefully sooner than later. But what kind of a solution is it to survive on a toxic planet? This is like telling a patient that he is well because he's not about to die. We need to adopt a new kind of consciousness in which the wellness of Spaceship Earth is true wellness, not simply the absence of potentially fatal conditions. Right now, we face the potential for ecological disaster on many fronts, from the melting glaciers of the Himalayas that threaten to dislocate millions of refugees to the rising seas that could submerge the Maldives and dying coral reefs all over the globe. Our choice is to stand back and passively let bad go to worse, or we could become active stewards of the planet.  A new consciousness involves networking and group efforts. It involves political influence and the development of new leadership. But all activity begins in consciousness first; you must be aware enough to look reality in the face. We aren't doing that except in fits and starts. Overwhelmed by bad news on the ecological front for more than a decade, all of us find it easier to shut down and tune out. The alternative seems like emotional numbness. But there's another alternative, the invigorating, energizing call to action that leads to personal fulfillment and empowerment. Healing this planet would be empowering for all of us. What won't empower us is sitting at the sickbed watching Mother Nature grow sicker until signs of death appear.  Planetary wellness needs to become a global movement, yet it begins with you and me, and the time to act is now."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Developer Network"],"author":"Guest Author","title":"Connect global teams, share information and work better together with Huddle and LinkedIn","date":"May 24, 2010","content":"Would you like to improve the way you work and communicate with your team and other organizations at the touch of a button?

Armed with megaphones and 5 miles worth of “Connect with me” police tape, we hit the streets looking to sign up volunteers.  Like any new network, the first few hundred people were hard to assemble -- convincing people to tie themselves to thousands of other people is oddly much harder than it sounds. Our volunteers pressed on turning skeptics into participants and hastily gathered the signatures needed to serve as proof to scrutinizing Guinness Book of World Records' judges. Our centipede began to grow through word of mouth, each new member asking another new member to join in. Ten minutes before the start, we hit critical mass and pandemonium ensued. At this point, we had documented over 1600 people, (I personally counted 4 Elvis’s, a few dozen clowns, and a handful chickens to boot), but our process went out the window as the centipede took on a life of its own. Sign up sheets were ditched as our volunteers worked at breakneck speed to connect the swarms of people who rushed to join in the final minutes before the start.  [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"320\" caption=\"Tallying sign up sheets for the Guinness Record\"] [/caption]  In the end, our historic arthropod stretched over several blocks and continued to add new connections as the front of the creature marched forward. Thanks to all who participated! While it appears we may have broken the record, , our tireless recorder is still reviewing the signature lists and video footage to deem whether it can be submitted for the official title. Documentation aside, it was great fun connecting with you all and taking part in this irreverent Bay Area tradition. UPDATE: The count is in. We have 2375 signatures that we've submitted to the Guinness Book of World Records.

Read on for all the technical details. For sites that primarily use LinkedIn for authentication (e.g. by showing users a \"Login with LinkedIn\" button), we now offer an alternative to the normal OAuth authorization flow: This authenticate endpoint functions identically to the authorization endpoint except for one scenario. When the following conditions are all true we will automatically (and immediately) redirect to your Application. This provides a great user experience - just a one click login! If any of the above conditions are not true, the member will see the normal authorization flow. If you already have your own account infrastructure, we're still looking out for you. We often see sites send already-authorized users through our OAuth authorize flow.  Perhaps the remote site lost the token or never persisted it. This situation results in users being asked for username/passwords again and again, with a new token created every time (a frustrating process, to be sure). So, we've made some improvements here.  Instead of requiring the user to login every time and create a new access token, we now allow the user to reuse an existing access token and quickly return to the site.  In most cases the user simply needs to click 'Continue' and they are back at your site immediately. As part of this streamlining process (and to leverage cookie persistence), we changed the OAuth authorization url to live on the www subdomain of linkedin.com: We recommend that all developers switch to this as soon as possible.  To help you autoconfigure your application we also return the current authorization URL as part of the requestToken response as the parameter. Want to know how long a token is valid for?  Until now your application had no hints about the validity length.  Some of our endpoints now return the expiration time of the token.  The requestToken response now includes the parameter.  The value of this is the number of seconds remaining for the token.  We'll be adding this to the accessToken response in a future release. Now you can invalidate an OAuth token for your application.  Just send an OAuth signed GET request to: A 200 response indicates that the token was successfully invalidated.

My work focuses on finding these patterns in large datasets and using statistics to make predictions from them. As the world becomes more heavily instrumented and can be logged more easily, there is a massive deluge of real time data points.  machine learning and data processing at scale to this information, combining it and remixing it with their own datasets to learn more and help solve real world problems. There’s an art to combining these datasets and learning from them, and this is where tools like Hadoop, Amazon Mechanical Turk, and machine learning come to our aid.  As an example, consider trying to standardize the user locations found within Twitter profiles. Twitter users can enter any text string as their location, so how do you link these to cities, states, and countries?  The trick I applied for my earlier this month was to aggregate a number of attributes for each distinct location string using Hadoop.  These attributes were things like the most frequent time zone, common phrases in Tweets at that location, languages, etc..  This context was then presented to Mechanical Turk workers along with the location string and the GeoNames database of standardized locations.  Several Mechanical Turk workers would choose the best location from the database for each string. Then we used statistical techniques on the results to find the most likely standard location for each user. At LinkedIn, we are doing the of with our internal datasets. You can think of each dataset as a slice of user information or behavior. One slice is work history, another slice is connection data (who is connected to whom), another slice is search queries, or words used in recommendations, and so on. With 65 million professionals, all of whom have incentive to fill out their profiles completely and honestly, these data slices are clean and robust. A single slice alone might tell us something high level, but combined, they are much more powerful. And we can still add in more slices from external sources like . Like a catscan, each slice lines up to create a three dimensional portrait of our user base. The trick here is keeping in mind the end goal—using data to create products that will make a difference in people's lives. In fact, this is one of the reasons I came to LinkedIn; there is a focus on one domain here, and with that focus comes novel, rich data about professionals and what influences them. Controlling scope and coming up with well-framed problems are difficult to do, and at LinkedIn, we always have the focus on the professional in the back of our minds. From there we are free to go attack the hardest and most valuable problems. As a result we now have the data to help answer questions that used to be decided by anecdote, hunches, or conjecture—questions like “Where should I go next in my career?” or “Who can help me learn more about that?” LinkedIn is really committed to great data, so when I walked in the door six months ago, there were virtually no barriers to me getting at what I needed. The Data Platform team had built thoughtful event tracking and user interfaces optimized for collecting quality data. In addition, the supporting tools for rapidly building data products — , , , , — were all in place. Every product built at LinkedIn is required to give back to our data ecosystem, so our ability to learn from users grows with each new launch. It's this growth of our knowledge that excites me the most—we've done so much, but really it’s just the tip of the iceberg. The potential here for new types of collaboration, advice and knowledge sharing, events, classes, mentoring and professional development — all powered by the data — is beyond the scope of anything that’s been done so far. And, that’s what I’m looking forward to tackling every day."},{"post_categories":["International","Featured","Europe, Middle East and Africa"],"author":"Arvind Rajan","title":"O LinkedIn fala português","date":"April 13, 2010","content":" Desde o início, o LinkedIn tem sido uma rede global, com a metade dos nossos usuários provenientes dos Estados Unidos e a outra metade de outras partes do mundo.

LinkedIn is a tool we at LexBlog consider essential for professionals looking to enhance their reputation. LinkedIn has become not only the leading professional directory in the world, it also provides tremendous networking opportunities when used effectively. So when the LinkedIn API was announced it made sense for LexBlog to integrate our blog platform with the LinkedIn API. One of the core components of the API is access to sending LexBlog Network updates into LinkedIn. As a publisher, this allows us to facilitate LexBlog Network authors to distribute their latest blog posts to their LinkedIn network connections. We linked the blog author's credentials on the LexBlog Network to a LinkedIn profile. That way if a LexBlog blog author opts to share his blog posts to connections on LinkedIn the steps are kept to a minimum. The blog author simply steps through a simple authorization created by LexBlog using the LinkedIn OAuth interface. Each new blog post is then shared across the blog author's LinkedIn network. Here's a screenshot of the user-interface LexBlog clients use to connect their blog to their LinkedIn network. • Our author's posts will automatically display in the Network Updates section on the Linked home page of each of an author's contacts at LinkedIn. • Each contact of our authors on LinkedIn will receive word of the author's new blog posts by an email of LinkedIn Network Updates. • If a blog author has more than one blog, they have the option to choose to associate one or all blogs with their LinkedIn account. • If a blog has multiple authors, only the blog posts published by an individual author are distributed to that author's LinkedIn network. LinkedIn OAuth support was an important component in tying the LexBlog Network blogs with their LinkedIn accounts because it means we aren't storing their LinkedIn user information on our server. We also found the timeline for being able to go from concept to launch with our API integration to be quick and painless. Business professionals rely on LexBlog to give them maximum exposure so as to build the professional's reputation as an authority. Thanks to LinkedIn's API, LexBlog Network Authors now have their blog content distributed to each person in the author's network on LinkedIn.

I’m happy to say that a Beta version of this functionality is now available. Here’s what you can do today to start leveraging your professional network within Outlook: As soon as LinkedIn and Outlook are connected, Outlook will start bringing in information about your LinkedIn network.  You should then start seeing profile photos and LinkedIn activity for any connection that e-mails you. Here’s a quick one-minute demo (key benefits after the jump): At LinkedIn, we believe every professional is more productive when their professional network is close at hand and available wherever they spend their professional time. Bringing this network into your inbox is thus an obvious extension to what LinkedIn does today and helps unlock several benefits: We hope that this functionality starts bringing some of the benefits of LinkedIn to where you spend a majority of your professional time – your Microsoft Outlook inbox.

One of the biggest trends in the professional space last year was the economic collapse. Reports from numerous sources all tell a similar story -- the economic downturn has affected thousands of companies with millions of workers laid off. At LinkedIn we have a unique view into the ebbs and flows of labor markets and one trend we noticed was there were beneficiaries of these large-scale upheavals.  In particular, we saw substantial spikes in user activity for the following 5 companies during major financial events: Each of these firms saw an increase in the LinkedIn activity of their employees, measured by member registrations or updates to the individual's company title on LinkedIn. This activity coincided with key corporate announcements such as the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by Bank Of America, or the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy announcement. [caption id=\"attachment_3889\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"503\" caption=\"Talent flow during the financial collapse (Source: LinkedIn Data)\"] [/caption] Where did all these employees go?  One hypothesis is that many of the employees left the financial industry.  According to the LinkedIn data set, that just isn't true. There are a handful of people that did transition to other industries and start new careers, but most stayed in the financial space. To be specific, other than two acquiring companies (Bank of America acquired Merrill Lynch and Nomura acquired Lehman Brothers' franchise in the Asia Pacific region), Barclays was by far the biggest beneficiary, scooping up 10% of the laid off talent, followed by Credit Suisse at 1.5% and Citigroup at 1.1 %.

That’s pretty powerful, and that’s what comes when you combine the scheduling power of an application like Tungle.me with the world’s largest business professional network – LinkedIn.

I’d like to give you an inside look at the process, principles, and decisions that went into designing that feature. Our overall goal was to create an inspiring and engaging experience on LinkedIn for finding people you already know, as well as discovering others you may find helpful. I’d like to talk about a couple of key philosophies that drove our design approach on Faceted Search. We strive to design based on a strong understanding of how people use the site. For example, we found that the average number of results per search on LinkedIn was well over 10,000, and a large portion of our searches were refinements on existing, broader searches. Looking at this data, we saw a huge opportunity to assist people in finding who they’re looking for, . We also conducted user interviews, lab tests, focus groups, and surveys to provide a strong picture of our users’ search habits and pain points when trying to find people on LinkedIn and elsewhere on the web. These were a few of the initial observations we gleaned from those conversations. For e.g : This feedback then drove some core design principles for the project: Facets not only help you filter your search results, but also create interesting “results” in themselves. They provide a summary of the search results, and bring forward the top ranking values for each facet, guiding further investigation and giving strong cues for further refinement. As you can see, we approached Faceted Search as an opportunity to enable a much more inspired and serendipitous exploration. And finally, the value of people search lies in relationships that matter. So, we made “relationship” a prominent facet, allowing people to easily refine along many dimensions such as company, school or location, but then further narrow that down to people you know or could be easily introduced to (from your second degree of connections). The response to faceted search has been tremendous, and we've seen significant increases in the number of searches by members since the release. We truly appreciate all the feedback we’re received from you both while testing faceted search as well as the user feedback you’ve provided after launch. And we’re not done iterating. Please continue to send us your ideas and suggestions. There are three ways to do that: either as a comment on this post, through the at the bottom of the people search page, or us on Twitter."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Talent Solutions"],"author":"Francois Dufour","title":"LinkedIn Jobs Stimulus: Connecting Professionals with Job Opportunities","date":"January 28, 2010","content":"The past months have been enormously difficult for the global economy.

To get started, link your mobile phone to Ribbit - a simple process that takes less than a minute.  Once setup is complete, Ribbit transcribes your voicemail to text and sends it to you via text message and email. When online, you can make browser-based calls using your mobile caller ID. Ribbit also provides you with an unlimited message inbox, where you can read, listen to, and even share copies of your voicemail, and much more. To enhance your experience of making and receiving calls online, Ribbit offers a powerful feature called Caller ID 2.0.  We designed Caller ID 2.0 so that you would know not only is calling but also the caller has been sharing online.  Many Ribbit Mobile customers are mobile professionals who are active on LinkedIn, so our team jumped at the chance to get access to the LinkedIn API. As we participated in the early LinkedIn beta process, we discovered that LinkedIn was a perfect API partner. Once we had our developer API and secret key, we quickly built our first prototype. LinkedIn is now a key part of CallerID 2.0. Today, when a call comes in or when you make a call, Ribbit Mobile reaches into the social web and finds the recent LinkedIn updates, Facebook updates, Tweets, and Flickr photos of the person calling you. If more than one match is found, Ribbit Mobile will ask you to select the right person.  To use Caller ID 2.0 with Ribbit Mobile, simply enter your credentials for your social feeds during setup. Entering your LinkedIn credentials allows Ribbit to search your professional network and provide real-time updates. Developing with the LinkedIn API was very straightforward.  OAuth allowed us to securely connect with LinkedIn and also present a “trusted” login interface that was familiar to LinkedIn users.  This is the same approach we are taking to allow developers to create Ribbit Mobile apps with the Ribbit API.  We’re looking forward to adding additional LinkedIn capabilities to Ribbit Mobile. If you’d like to join our beta, you can sign up for Ribbit Mobile .  Enter the invite code “LinkedIn” and we’ll send you an invite as fast as we can."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Tips","New LinkedIn Features"],"author":"Jatin Shah","title":"A better way to browse your LinkedIn connections","date":"January 26, 2010","content":"As a company that’s based on the mantra “Relationships Matter”; we want to make it easier than ever for you to find, organize and stay in touch with your business connections.

Thanks to all of you who have sent us . We are now in the process of rolling out the new design to all of our users. If you don’t see the change yet, you will sometime in the next week. The first thing you’ll notice in the new design is that there is no persistent left-hand navigation. All global navigation is in the top navigation bar. We did this in order to free up space for page content – information about you and your professional network. Another thing you’ll notice is that the new global navigation bar takes up less vertical space. Page content is moved up higher on the page – less scrolling! The global navigation bar is always available and provides convenient access to all LinkedIn services. Pass your mouse over the bar and you will see menus that provide quick access to the most popular LinkedIn features. For example, the Groups menu has links for finding and creating groups; it also has quick links for the groups you access the most often. Additional applications and services are available under the More menu. When you are in an area of LinkedIn  (such as Contacts or Groups) you see local navigation. The major sub areas are in tabs along the top of the page. If the page allows filtering of content (such as Discussions or Search Results) these options are shown on the left.

Two round milestones with global significance happened in 2009 - 150 years have passed since the publication of Charles Darwin's landmark Origin of Species, and 40 years have gone by since the Department of Defense launched ARPANET, the nucleus from which the modern Internet developed. Darwin's work revolutionized our understanding of biology, and is now part of the scientific foundation supporting the modern-day biotechnology industry.  Similarly, the Internet has grown from a network connecting a modest 4 host computers to the worldwide web linking millions of hosts, forever changing the way we gather and handle information.  These seemingly disparate global phenomena are becoming increasingly intertwined as Internet technologies find ever more uses in the biotech workplace, speeding communication. We've come a long way from Darwin's elegant that he exchanged with fellow scientists in his field. Today, social networking sites like LinkedIn are emerging as powerful tools to identify and connect with hidden resources that can give a project team leader a much-needed edge in an increasingly competitive world.

That doesn’t happen every day, I thought. What it brought home to me was the key reason why there are now more than three million LinkedIn members in the UK. It’s not down to the range of features we offer, the speed at which we innovate, or the number of languages the site is available in. It’s the members and the rich mix of expertise, experience, wisdom and the positive, collaborative attitude that they bring. Without you, there would be no LinkedIn. I started with LinkedIn almost two years ago and it’s been quite a ride as we’ve watched the British professional community take to the site with the sort of industrious enthusiasm that typifies the way business is done in this country. Our team in London has grown alongside the membership and, thanks in no small part to the great reception LinkedIn has had in the UK, we’re now looking to further expansion into Europe. To mark hitting yesterday’s special milestone, one of our co-founders Reid Hoffman made a special trip to the UK to personally thank and celebrate with some our members (naturally) in central London last night. As the conversation flowed it was humbling to see the variety of our membership all in one room; from financiers to software developers, journalists to entrepreneurs and public sector figures to marketers, all these and more were represented from young rising stars to established industry leaders and CEOs. Events such as this allow us to get the immediate first-hand feedback we want from our members on their experience of the site and reaction to recent developments.

Apart from traditional challenges of running a high-traffic 24/7 service, we are also faced with the unique problems of scaling the professional graph, making all our services interoperable while respecting privacy and visibility rules along that graph.

With close to 1 million Australian professionals already on the site and double-digit growth over the past year, word is spreading fast. Even more impressive is that Australia is one of LinkedIn’s top performing countries, particularly when viewed as a factor of professionals per capita. CR: It’s a combination of reasons. What really stands out for me is how quickly LinkedIn has grown to be the largest networking site for professionals in Australia and New Zealand. Much of LinkedIn’s growth has been driven entirely by word of mouth and that tells me just how large the potential could be now that we are establishing a local presence. I am convinced that LinkedIn will be the default professional services site both on the web and on mobile. CR: I have been an avid user of LinkedIn for many years – at first, like a lot of users, signing up because someone I trusted invited me and from there I just seemed to get more and more invites. Today, LinkedIn is where I stay in touch with my peers, to communicate, collaborate and share, in a respectful yet fun way. My favorite LinkedIn feature would have to be the recently launched that enables me to keep notes and interesting facts on colleagues and contacts. I also use LinkedIn on my mobile when out and about to access colleagues’ contact details or look up someone’s profile before a meeting. CR: Well, in many ways we are in start-up mode in Australia, with the big difference from a typical start up being that we have a great brand and a rapidly growing and engaged customer base. Some of my key priorities include establishing our offices in Sydney, bringing on board some of the best and brightest people and most importantly engaging with our fast growing user community at an even deeper level. CR: Professionals no longer think of long-term careers with the same company. The world has definitely become ‘flatter’ and the concept of geographic boundaries is becoming less of an issue as technological advances enable us to be increasingly networked and connected. In my opinion today’s professional increasingly acts as a small business rather than an employee and is constantly looking for new growth opportunities. With that thinking in mind, LinkedIn provides the perfect solution for professionals to navigate this new way of thinking and operating. As a final thought, I also think that within 10 years LinkedIn will be an essential career management course  graduates go to begin their careers. I’d love to hear from our users in Australia what some of your successes on using LinkedIn have been lately.

As professionals leverage their real time social stream more and more for content discovery and relationship management, LinkedIn has become a must have network for us.  Thanks to the new open LinkedIn Platform, we've been able to deliver that in an extremely short amount of time. For developers considering the LinkedIn platform, we can say with confidence that it's been extremely easy to develop on.  Within a couple days of getting our developer key we'd completed our initial integration that enabled our users to view their LinkedIn updates stream, update their LinkedIn status, or view and search their LinkedIn contacts. Yoono already leverages oAuth for other supported social networking services such as Twitter, MySpace, and FriendFeed so it was a big bonus with LinkedIn’s embrace of oAuth as well. We're already working on designing additional features supported by LinkedIn and most of all we're excited about the possibilities. If you'd like to learn more about Yoono 7, check out our blog post .  You can download our Firefox add-on today with LinkedIn support as well as new features such as support for Twitter Lists, Facebook Inbox & Notifications, multiple accounts per social network, Groups ( ) and full text search of your social stream so you can see what your LinkedIn connections have to say about a particular topic. We'll also be updating our Yoono Desktop for Windows and Mac with LinkedIn support later this week, so stay tuned. We recently passed 3 million downloads and we're confident LinkedIn integration is going to further extend our reach and provide more value for our users. Congrats to the LinkedIn team on a great start for the Platform!"},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Developer Network"],"author":"Elliot Shmukler","title":"Coming Soon: Your Professional Network within Microsoft Outlook","date":"November 18, 2009","content":"Today, Microsoft an exciting new addition to the upcoming Microsoft Office 2010 – the Outlook Social Connector. The Outlook Social Connector is designed to seamlessly bring communications history as well as business and social networking feeds into your Outlook experience. LinkedIn will be the first networking site to support the Outlook Social Connector. The LinkedIn functionality will be available in early 2010. Our big belief is that you can be much more effective if you have your professional network close at hand, and you can leverage your online identity in the work you do on a daily basis. The Outlook Social Connector will bring your LinkedIn Professional Network to where you work – right within your e-mail inbox. Here are three key benefits you get from this integration: One of the great things about LinkedIn is being able to learn what your professional connections are working on and thinking about. Just glance at the Network Updates on your LinkedIn homepage and you’ll be able to learn what articles & books your connections are reading, what conferences they are attending, and what questions they are asking and answering on LinkedIn. Many use this information to keep current with their industry and profession, as well as to learn new things and expand their horizons. The Outlooks Social Connector makes this even easier – by automatically showing the latest activity (i.e. Network Updates) from any LinkedIn connection that sends you an e-mail. So now you can get the latest information from your LinkedIn network even without having to leave your inbox. What’s more, for any connection with a public LinkedIn profile photo, you’ll even get to see their picture as you communicate. Know that perfect LinkedIn connection to help you with a business task or question but don’t remember their current email address? No longer do you have to go to the LinkedIn website to find their contact information before sending them a message, as your LinkedIn network is now available right within your inbox.  Just start typing the name of a LinkedIn connection in the “To:” field of an Outlook message and the connections’ e-mail address from LinkedIn will automatically appear as if they are an existing Outlook contact. In fact, the Outlook Social Connector will create an Outlook Contacts folder for all of your LinkedIn connections and bring down their contact information, professional details, and picture from LinkedIn into Outlook. Working with someone new but haven’t had a chance to connect with them on LinkedIn? By bringing professional networking to where you work, the Outlook Social Connector again makes it easy. Just click a button next to any e-mail you receive and instantly send an invitation to connect to the e-mail’s sender. It’s that easy. We hope that these functions start bringing some of the key elements of your LinkedIn professional network to where you work – your Outlook e-mail inbox, sometime early next year.

I’m convinced that LinkedIn will play a strong role as a platform for sharing connections and knowledge. India is the largest democracy on earth and one of the fastest growing economies globally. We have a large, skilled workforce and in the recent past our IT, services and telecommunications businesses have given us global acclaim.

The was founded in 1999 to foster development of the open source Apache HTTP Server --  which powers millions of web sites worldwide. Based on this success other projects were added over time. Each project is able to take advantage of the technical, legal and organizational resources provided by Apache. Today there are hundreds of high quality projects under the Apache umbrella. The high quality and open nature of Apache software is in heavy use at LinkedIn. Many of our servers run . We build our software with Apache Ant and Ivy. Diverse and useful libraries such as Apache HttpClient, Commons, and Lucene  provide great functionality for Linkedin with less effort. This allows us to focus on what we do best -- providing a great web experience to our members. Leveraging Apache software is only the start. LinkedIn actively contributes code, design and testing to many Apache projects. These efforts insure that these projects continue to grow and evolve to meet our future challenges. In addition to our contributions to Apache Shindig you'll find LinkedIn active in the Apache Lucene community where we've developed a number of extensions to this powerful search technology.

The Shindig REST API allows our internal and external developers to access data using the and the standards.

Many of the comments you posted online are similar to those we have heard from doctors, nurses, physician assistants, and other medical professionals across the county.  You see firsthand the problems with our health care system – what happens when patients cannot receive the care they need because an insurance company has decided to drop or water down coverage, or when individuals do not have check-ups or preventive screenings because insurance companies do not cover them or they are uninsured.  Dr. Joel commented that “our focus needs to shift to strategies of prevention and include incentives for healthier lifestyles.” Some of you expressed concern about rising health costs.  You are right.  The rising cost of health care in this country is unsustainable.  We are now spending roughly one in every six dollars on health care.  If we do nothing, in 30 years, one out of every three dollars in our economy will be tied up in the health care system.  Melissa S wrote that “my biggest concern is the cost associated with health plans.”  Health care costs are rising more than three times faster than wages, and premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance for family coverage have risen 131 percent in the last ten years and went up five percent this year alone.  One of the central goals of the President’s plan is to slow the growth rate of health care spending that is crushing families, businesses, and governments.  Health insurance reform will accomplish this by increasing competition in the insurance market, wringing waste and fraud out of Medicare and Medicaid, and working to change our health care priorities to emphasize quality of care rather than quantity of services.  Health insurance reform will limit what you have to pay out-of-pocket for health care and will do away with annual and lifetime caps on coverage. Others wrote about patients who cannot move or change jobs because they have a pre-existing condition or simply cannot afford coverage on the expensive private insurance market.  Dr. Anje V discussed “patients who have lost their insurance due to job loss.”  Under the President’s plan, Americans will have the security of knowing they have options.  People who are uninsured or are forced to seek coverage on today’s expensive individual market will be able to find affordable plans in the insurance exchange, a marketplace where you can shop for what is right for you.  Insurance companies will no longer be allowed to deny you coverage because you have a pre-existing condition, and they will be prohibited from cancelling your coverage when you get sick. Several of you – including Frank W, a neuroradiology fellow – expressed concerns about the medical liability system.  As part of the Administration’s ongoing effort to reform our health care system, we have listened to the concerns many have raised about the need to improve patient safety and to reform our medical liability system.  President Obama recently directed Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius to move forward immediately on an initiative to give states and health care systems the opportunity to apply for demonstration projects on medical liability consistent with certain goals and core commitments.  You can read more about these demonstration grants . We appreciate the contributions of doctors, nurses, physician assistants, and other medical professionals around the country.  You are on the front lines of the health care system and see every day how the problems with the current system are impacting you, your patients, and their families.  Thank you for joining this discussion, and we look forward to hearing from you again. We'd also like this to be the start of an ongoing conversation through the LinkedIn Group we've started for this purpose.

There's nothing more gratifying as a developer than to see your work go live. This past summer, I was able to dedicate myself to enhancing the LinkedIn mobile platform. In the Fall of 2008, I was lucky enough to be one of the first students to take the new course at Stanford. I was looking for the opportunity to put that work to good use, and LinkedIn was excited to have me join the mobile team for the summer. LinkedIn for iPhone v1.5 adds a large number of caching and performance improvements to the original LinkedIn application. For most people, however, the most noticeable change will be the addition of a single new module: Inbox. The Inbox offers quick and easy access to three key features: Invitations, Messages & Sent Items. The Invitations tab shows you all of your pending invitations, making it easy to quickly accept requests anywhere. The user interface includes the image of the inviter (if available), which makes it that much easier to recognize them. The badge shows you quickly how many pending invitations you have outstanding. The application also lets you send invitations, either by entering their email address, or by going to their profile and clicking the invitation button. The messages tab offers quick access to all of of your outstanding messages from your connections. The badge on the tab shows you how many unread messages you have. We've tried to make it as easy as possible to get through your messages by replying or archiving each item. You can also send a message to any of your LinkedIn connections. Most internships at high tech startups involve new technologies and cool products. But it's not everyday that you get to ship a real product like this with the potential to benefit millions of users. I just want to say a quick thank you to , , and the entire LinkedIn mobile team. There are a lot of exciting improvements to the LinkedIn mobile platform on the way, but for now, I hope the addition of the Inbox will make the LinkedIn iPhone application an even more essential tool for mobile professionals.

Needless to say, I listened and learned a ton about social networking in India. Below is a synopsis of our chat in Gurgaon (southwest of Delhi) last week. I just met with a bunch of Indian PR firms and almost all of them pointed to you as the most influential blogger on social media in India. ( ) It’s probably because of my book on LinkedIn and a couple of columns I wrote in the media here.  My goes to print today. That’s great. What the heck are you doing here with me then? Well, it’s done so there’s not much to do today other than promote it.  It’s a pictorial travelogue of my trip through Ladakh, a high altitude Himalayan region bordering Tibet and Pakistan. Travelling has become a key agenda in my life; I need to get away from the cacophony of big cities and the rat race forced upon all of us. Call it social ‘un-networking’ – or seeking opportunities to make friends with even those who have never seen a computer. Send me an InMail on how to buy it and I’ll check it out. You’re kind of living the dream. I don’t know many people who wouldn’t want to make a living as a blogger and travel writer. ( ) I have a long waiting list of those wanting to assist me. But this option does not come with guaranteed pay checks I tell them. In all your talks and trainings on how to use social media and LinkedIn, what have you found is the most interesting use or issue with it in India? Recruiters seem to be most active here, but they tend to rely more on Introductions and InMails to get through to candidates.  Just to save a few advertising dollars, they often tend to be irksome. Some LinkedIn users don’t seem to realize the value of interacting on the site just like they would in the real world. You can play the fool on MySpace and Facebook if you choose to, but LinkedIn is all about real people, with real identities out to conduct serious business. Indian users also tend to get suddenly active when they have a need. This can sometimes be seen as selfish behavior.  You have to nurture relationships over time to get the most out of your contacts. It’s back to what we should be doing in the real world. A cultural trait is worth mentioning here: Indians are generally happier to socialize and talk in person. We are not very keen on written communication which often comes in the way of meaningful engagement on social media and blogs. And unlike the West, we have an overdose of people socializing with us including family, friends and colleagues. For many Indians, we want social isolation rather than more networking. What is a common misconception you hear about India and social media? It may sound strange in the American context, but you may need to go a little offline. And organize some face to face meets with users in India to drive home value of LinkedIn, what they should be doing and how to conduct themselves. It will require a bit of effort, but the same thing documented and sent electronically won’t resonate. Again, Indians tend to ask and figure things out rather than read any manuals or books explaining the same point better. Which is exactly why I flew 9,000 miles to see you, right? Well, you could have just emailed me!"},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Mobile","New LinkedIn Features"],"author":"Adam Nash","title":"LinkedIn syncs with Synergy on the Palm Pre","date":"September 30, 2009","content":"In June, I was excited to announce that .  Since then, we've gotten quite a bit of feedback about the new platform, and as expected, quite a few feature requests.

Usually, I resort to bookmarking the profiles in my web browser or scribbling down names on a piece of paper. Today we are launching Profile Organizer, a new Premium feature that lets you save profiles, organize them into folders, and add notes. Anytime you find an interesting profile, simply click “Save Profile” and the profile is bookmarked for you within LinkedIn. When you click “Save Profile”, the profile is added to your Profile Organizer. You now see a module on the profile page from which you can save a profile into a designated folder, add contact information, and private notes that are visible only to you.  It’s a great way to remember relevant details about contacts, and develop your relationships. The Profile Organizer accessible through the Contacts tab, where you can manage all of your saved profiles organized into specific folders. Profile Organizer also lets you save profiles directly from the search results page. With just one click, you can save a profile and add it to a folder directly from search. If you do many searches on LinkedIn, the single-click “save profile” action can save you time. You no longer need to review each interesting profile in detail: just save from the search results page, and you can narrow down your list in Profile Organizer later. A few of us at LinkedIn have started using Profile Organizer and find it particularly helpful after attending networking events or conferences.  In the past, I collected a stack of business cards and came back from the event unsure about what to do with them. Now, I find the contacts on LinkedIn, and jot down relevant information into Profile Organizer. The next time I go to a similar event, I simply glance through my notes to recall details about our past conversations. If you have a minute, check out this short feature demo: Get started using the new feature by clicking on the “Save Profile” link from any LinkedIn profile or search results.

Liz Ryan from Business Week's \"The Workplace\" column has an insightful post for those who've wondered why sending in your resume doesn't necessarily get you that job interview. Liz outlines of landing a job interview after you've sent in your resume. Start with to see whether one of your first-degree connections is connected to a relevant person (someone who works in the department where there's an opening, a peer in another department, or best of all, the hiring manager) in the hiring department. If you do have a two- or three-step relationship to that inside person, ask your first-degree connection to make an introduction for you. (You can do this by clicking on the \"Get Introduced Through a Connection\" link on your \"target\" person's profile page.) The easiest way to get started would be on LinkedIn's , where you can search through specific keywords to locate the right contact at the hiring company. Tips #2 and #3 in the post explains how important it is to do your homework about the company or industry when looking for a job. LinkedIn lets you browse and research companies or even industries that you'd like to work for. Clicking through a company profile shows you current or former employees from that company who you're currently connected with and can pass your resume to the right folks within the company. For example: check out . As Liz summarized, finding a job interview is more a direct result of your attempts to find contacts at that company who can put in a good word for you, and less about how great your resume is. There is an element of luck in getting an interview, but you can do more than toss a résumé into the hopper and wait for a phone call. You can work assiduously to find contacts who can put in a good word for you, make introductions for you, and fill you in on the issues that are top-of-mind for the employer you're targeting. When you spot a job you know you'd love and would thrive at, don't hesitate to call on your network to help make it happen.

Fortunately, in the 21st century, with the birth of the social web, we have tools at our disposal that are orders of magnitude more powerful than we have ever had as individuals or as a society.  To quote David Weinberger from his recent talk at PDF09, What we used to believe because we thought the author was objective we now believe because we can see through the author’s writings to the sources and values that brought her to that position. Transparency gives the reader information by which she can undo some of the unintended effects of the ever-present biases. Transparency brings us to reliability the way objectivity used to. This change is, well, epochal. David is talking about journalism, but his insights are at the heart of why LinkedIn is such a powerful concept.  On LinkedIn, the skills that you've spent your career obtaining, the experience that you've earned, the trusted relationships that you've formed - they are all made largely transparent.  Your professional reputation and relationships matter - and not just to you.  That value extends far beyond your profile itself - it carries over to every interaction, every message, and every piece of contributed content. Most people who have applied to higher level educational institutions are familiar with the traditional methods of gathering recommendations.  Finding an advisor, mentor, or teacher willing to fill out a series of questions and write a sealed letter of recommendation. LinkedIn Recommendations bring liquidity and transparency to the reputation economy.  As a result, the way people evaluate and respond to recommendations is changing as well. Jeremiah Owyang recently about a decision he has made to temporarily stop giving recommendations on LinkedIn.  In his post, he flags a number of concerns he has heard about recommendations and their relative value.  The comments on his post, and the responses on Twitter were interesting enough that it seems worthwhile to capture five of the insights about LinkedIn recommendations I gleaned here: Detailed characteristics, specific achievements, highly credible and relevant source.  That's what you want to see. As food for thought, let me challenge you to consider the following: In this economy, more than ever people are realizing that the most important assets they have are the skills and experiences they have earned, and the trusted relationships they have formed.  As I mentioned above, we all know great people who deserve our public recognition.  They deserve the benefit of our hard-earned reputations, applied to endorse theirs.

My business, , was started in February 2007.  My vision was to provide simple and straightforward technical services to the area where I live, work, and play.  I wanted to connect with other professionals and business owners in the local Erie, Pennsylvania area, so I decided to create and administer a group on LinkedIn called .  I, along with some others in the group, promote our individual businesses and discuss everything from politics to the local economy on the LinkedErie discussion board.  It has been a tremendous help to get to know some of my current and potential customers through this group on LinkedIn. Soon the time came when I realized another advantageous benefit of social networking and LinkedIn.  While I was working towards building a sizable local customer base and getting our name out there, InControl Technical was contacted by a company out of Greenville, South Carolina.  They found us on the Web by doing a search for “computer repair erie pa” and found my LinkedIn profile that I link to .  After viewing my credentials and seeing the recommendations on my LinkedIn profile, the company felt that InControl Technical would be a good fit for their clients in Erie, PA.  The company that contacted us installs and services equipment that is tied in with local servers at various law enforcement agencies.  Based on the recommendations and credentials posted on my LinkedIn profile and the pricing information that is readily available on our Web site, this company felt comfortable trusting us to service their installed server equipment at a reasonable cost. Since then, we’ve received calls from other companies outside of our immediate area wanting to utilize our services to assist with everything from temporary small projects to dedicated ongoing support for field employees who don’t have access to a corporate information services department.  Without the enormous power and potential of social networking and LinkedIn, I truly believe that the task of expanding outside of invisible geographical walls would be much more difficult to accomplish. ---  I'm sure many of you reading this post may wonder how you can reap similar benefits by optimizing your LinkedIn profile for keywords pertaining to your consultancy (both for freelancers or small businesses). For starters, make sure your LinkedIn profile is up-to-date with the latest information on your small business offerings. For example. Not only is Thomas' profile summary up-to-date, but he's also updated the \"Specialties\" section with a list of keywords related to the technical consulting offered by his small business. You may notice that the keywords he's added are also localized mentioning Erie, Pennsylvania. This is a great way to come up in search results when prospective clients search for vendors in that particular location. In this particular example Thomas' profile showed up when the prospective client searched for “ ” and found 14 results, the first of which was Thomas's profile. If you're looking for vendors, don't stop with basic search.

LinkedIn is a global network of over 42 million professionals from every country around the world, with approximately half of our member base outside the United States. Our mission at LinkedIn is to connect the world’s professionals, and we would like to do this in as many languages as possible. A frequent request from our members is to offer the LinkedIn website in their native language. Today, the LinkedIn website is available in four languages: English, Spanish, French and German (we allow users to offer their profiles in over 40 languages), but we'd like to extend that to as many professionals as possible around the globe by offering additional languages. Currently, we are investigating the best way to translate our site into more languages. Since this is a decision that will impact millions of our users, we wanted to hear from our members on what they thought were some of the most effective ways to make this happen. Fortunately, some of the best professional experts in this area are members of the LinkedIn community, so we were able to leverage their insights through a direct survey. The chart below outlines the responses we got from over 12,000 professionals this past week. We are happy to see that thousands of members expressed an interest in contributing to the translation of LinkedIn.  More importantly, this survey gives us a deeper understanding of what would be of value to the members who expressed interest in bringing LinkedIn into additional languages.  These options typify some of the value propositions that members often get from LinkedIn, and we were interested in hearing which ones would be of most interest.  You can see the range of responses above.  Premium subscription was the most popular choice, followed by recognition on a member’s profile.  Requests for direct compensation was the most common response under the “Other” category. Our survey shows that one of the most important benefits of a community translation effort on LinkedIn would be that a member's contributions could be highlighted directly on their professional profile.  Numerous professionals demonstrate their expertise on LinkedIn every day as a means of enhancing their professional reputation. This effort could extend those benefits to members who work in the translation and localization industry. We are still in the process of evaluating different options for translating the site into additional languages.   Thank you to all of the members who've taken time to offer us your valuable feedback."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Tips"],"author":"Guest Author","title":"How to overcome the financial challenge of professional networking","date":"June 23, 2009","content":"On any given day, it seems I could attend an event and meet the individual who will be key to landing my next job.  This is because my email inbox is constantly loaded with invitations and announcements for upcoming professional networking events. My challenge isn’t a lack of time, interest or need to attend these networking functions, it is lack of money. Pre-layoff I thought little of registration fees for such activities but post-layoff is another matter.  Their expense has been an unanticipated cost of unemployment.  As a result, I too often find myself foregoing events that  I would prefer to attend.  The longer I am unemployed, the more often I expect this to happen. Inevitably, I find myself torn between feeling as though I can’t afford to go to an event but that I also can’t afford to go. What makes matters worse is that career service industry experts agree networking is one of the most critical components of a job search.  They say that especially in weaker  economies you are more likely to find your career opportunity through networking and not on job boards. This is where online social media tools such as  LinkedIn, and Meetup.com help.  They allow me to extend my reach and meet people for low or no cost.  When you consider typical networking expenses can easily exceed $400 per month, leveraging these resources is a no-brainer. One of the ways I use LinkedIn to extend my networking budget through the “Groups and Associations”.  I look for local chapters of organizations as well as groups in the functions and industries where I desire to work. I join groups and then contact members on an individual basis.  If they are located near me I’ll request to physically meet, otherwise my goal is a phone call.  The shared group connection makes it easy to connect and increases the likelihood they will make time to talk.  Long-term, I retain connections to organizations and peers that can continue to contribute to my professional growth."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Reid Hoffman","title":"New LinkedIn CEO: Jeff Weiner has updated his profile","date":"June 24, 2009","content":"has updated his profile from President to CEO of LinkedIn.

In the new world of work, every professional should establish their own brand online; every professional engages their network in order to connect with the people and information they need to compete and succeed. While Jeff leads the company, I will focus on some big picture strategic issues for Linkedin – how Linkedin evolves to become more and more essential to professionals seeking to stay informed and find the right resources to accomplish their tasks fast and effectively.

These were little more than hobbies until my first pink slip showed up, after I'd spent nearly 29 years in the industry.

For those of you familiar with our iPhone application, you'll notice that we've taken a decidedly different approach with this first version for the Palm Pre.  We designed this application from the ground up for the new webOS platform.  As a result, you'll find the application features a simple but elegant set of features that integrate seamlessly into the platform. With LinkedIn for the Palm Pre, you can easily view up-to-date information about any of your LinkedIn connections.  We've also seamlessly integrated LinkedIn search into the interface - typing in a name will not only search your connections, but will also reach across the cloud to LinkedIn to search the entire LinkedIn network in the background. Why walk into any interview, sales call, or client meeting without knowing the details of who you are meeting with?  With LinkedIn, you're able to type that name in a few minutes before the meeting, and walk in an expert. LinkedIn for Palm Pre also debuts, for the first time, the ability to truly connect on the go.  Not only does the new application offer the ability to send invitations, but also a clear and simple inbox to accept invitations. We know that more and more professionals expect the ability to have the power of their professional networks wherever they go.  We're extremely excited to be a part of the launch of the Palm Pre, and this is one of many exciting new advances in mobile services that we're planning for 2009. To learn more, we've posted a new page on the LinkedIn website about the whole family of . P.S.

After spending 18 hours a day on my start-up, the lack of sleep finally got to me and I realised that although I have a very creative mind, the day to day detail of running a business was not what I was good at. I am a salesman and proud of it. The business reached the point where I needed help but didn't know it and luckily at this very time a partner asked to buy the majority share of the business. Very good I said and the business was sold. With the extra time I had, I wrote (Wiley / Capstone - March 2009) and (Wiley / Capstone - September 2009), which will be released later this year. I was first offered speaking opportunities at Schools and Universities to both undergraduates and MBA courses. The new contacts on the MBA courses invited me to speak at their companies on the story behind the business, the books and my ideas for start-ups in the current economy. With all of this attention on speaking I thought I should formalise the opportunity and sent out a note to all my LinkedIn contacts describing how I advanced my career and am willing to come and speak at any events and functions for a fee. The response has been overwhelming and I have had to turn down speaking engagements which is both good and bad. Good because there are five in my family and I really enjoy spending time with them all and bad because of all the missed opportunities to network with the business communities I have never met before. I am really enjoying life at the moment and I have to put it down to my new found ability to network using all the social media sites around. For friends I use Facebook; for day-to-day I use Twitter; but for business I use LinkedIn.

To this end, we built a technology that reads the data in your travel confirmation emails and uses it to create a master itinerary that’s easy to customize and share. Along the way, we also added support for over 500 travel booking sites worldwide. As a startup, we were pretty excited when LinkedIn approached us about the last year. We immediately recognized this as a huge opportunity to deliver real benefits to business travelers. When we designed the My Travel application, we wanted to deliver immediate value to LinkedIn users. Once the application is installed, you immediately see everyone in your LinkedIn network who will be close to you when you travel. We knew that this would not only become a great business resource, but will also provide some fun opportunities for people to get together socially. Also, now more than ever, businesses are looking for ways to get the most out of the dollars they spend on travel. By making it easy for business travelers to set up productive meetings while they are on the road, the TripIt app is uniquely able to squeeze a little more value out of those dollars. We get a lot of feedback from people who have connected with former colleagues, classmates and friends using the My Travel application on LinkedIn. I thought it would be fun to share a couple of real stories. Read on... , Travel Industry Consultant and Senior Marketing / eCommerce Executive: Several industry contacts were attending the same conference in San Francisco. They saw that I was also traveling to San Francisco, via the TripIt application on LinkedIn, and sent me messages asking to meet while we were all there. I would say that these meetings were the best return on my investment for the two-day event! Had it not been for TripIt, it would have been unlikely that these meetings would have occurred - or had I just met up with the people at the conference with no forewarning, the meeting agendas would certainly not have been set in advance. Now, when I am going to events, I alert everyone using the TripIt application on LinkedIn. , Google Developer Advocate: So, I'm at this conference about social networks for the education community in Montreal, and I meet up with Sylvain Carle at breakfast. I used to follow Sylvain’s blog years ago, and we had a web friendship, but had never met. Since we both use social networks heavily, we're connected on LinkedIn. And, without knowing it, we both use the TripIt app on LinkedIn. During a session, I sit down next to Sylvain and start preparing demos for my Open Social presentation, while tweeting about the session. I wanted to demo the TripIt app on LinkedIn, because it is one of the social apps that I find really useful. And then it happens- I open the app and see that someone in my network is also in Montreal today- Sylvain, who's sitting right next to me. That was so hilarious that I did a screenshot and tweeted it right away. To me this is a fun example of the power of a social application like TripIt, transforming business trips in social objects, and helping me meet old friends, or discover new ones.

A safe one. I'm sure there's more than a few of you out there that have spent hours, even days crafting the perfect cover letter and polishing your resume for a group of prospective employers, only to never hear back from any of them.  You swear you knocked it out of the park, but you just didn't get the response you were hoping for. The reality is that there were at least a dozen other people that did the same thing and thought they knocked their resume and cover letter out of the park too. Whether times are good or bad, getting that extra edge has always been important. You may have the right experience, degrees and attributes, but when employers have stacks and stacks of resumes sitting on their desk, you need something that's going to make you stand out, especially these days. Writing great cover letters and resumes are a good start - an essential one, at that. But how can you go beyond that? One of the great things about LinkedIn is that you can show and tell so much more about yourself. Potential employers and connections can read recommendations about you, what your interests are and other details that are tough to fit into a standard cover letter and resume. Using , you can showcase what makes you and your experience unique - you can showcase your work. In case you're not familiar with , it's a service that lets individuals and businesses store and share all kinds of content online. Besides standard files like Word documents, Excel sheets and PowerPoint presentations, you can store creative files, digital photos, videos, audio files...anything you want.

No matter what field you're in, you can upload it to Box and share it right on your LinkedIn profile for the whole world to see. Share things like: •    Illustrator and Photoshop files to display a creative portfolio •    Writing samples of white papers, product brochures or press releases you've authored •    A comprehensive archive of professional photography you've put together •    Audio files of commercial jingles or voiceover projects •    Digital movies you've created or video testimonials from your best references •    Coding samples to show off your awesome programming skills That just scratches the surface. If you think about all the work you've done, chances are you can share so much more of it than you thought. And you can do this easily just by uploading content to Box, putting it in a designated folder and sharing that folder on your LinkedIn profile. Get the . As the Community Manager for Box.net, I use the Files app to showcase some of my work at Box - podcasts I did when we launched our iPhone app and links to interviews and articles I've been a part of for various Box launches. It's the kind of thing I could never do on a resume and cover letter. This goes the other way too. When I was interviewing candidates for a marketing opening at Box, a few candidates mentioned pieces of information they learned from my profile and referenced some of the files I posted in my own Box portfolio. It impressed me how much research they did ahead of the interview and how detail-oriented they were. Those points were not lost in our internal candidate discussions. Again, it all comes back to what makes you stand out. You might have the same degrees, professional background and skill set as the competition. But no one has this - your body of work.

Here’s how to find a job.","date":"May 1, 2009","content":"You’re graduating, and can’t decide what type of work you want.  Don’t fret! Here are some tips to help you get into action: * Act as if you know what you want. Find a way to connect to an opportunity, whether it’s the function, company, industry, or location. Your desire will inspire you to make contacts, develop materials, and apply for jobs. * Consider every job an opportunity to learn, if not about specific responsibilities then about the organization or industry. Your ongoing challenge is to clarify what you like and dislike, a process that may take some time. Moreover, you never know when or where an experience may come in handy. * Recognize that any job is not your life, won't last forever, and you don't have to choose the “perfect” job your first time (or even second or third times, for that matter). A year in a job may seem like an eternity, but (in most circumstances) won't kill you. At the same time, you can participate in professional organizations and pursue other non-work interests with the possibility that such efforts will yield future work options. * Develop a plan A, plan B, and even a plan C for your job search, based on your interests. In other words, always have a backup plan should your first (or second) choice not work out. Who knows, your plan B job may evolve into a plan A job -- or may even become what you truly want to do!

Manage expectations - Schedule a purposeful conversation to discuss everyone's expectations regarding the career search. Take advantage of this time to get everything out on the table in terms of needs and desires. 2. Acknowledge emotions - The graduate may be experiencing fears of failure or sadness about leaving college friends behind. Parents may be uneasy about moving closer to an empty nest.  It is okay to grieve your losses even as you celebrate the opportunities. 3.  Develop healthy boundaries - The graduate is moving to a new level of responsibility in their lives and it is essential for a shift to take place in the parent / child relationship.  Behaving as a responsible independent adult starts at home but bears fruit in the workplace. 4.  Learn the skill of job searching - Parents can offer support and input, but need to avoid undermining or enabling the job search. Respect the boundaries and allow the graduate to take responsibility for the search and doing the real work. 5. Utilize resources – Reduce your anxiety by engaging support from college career centers, alumni associations, and web resources. If you still need additional support seek out a qualified career coach or counselor. Enjoy this time in your life and remember that as big as this feels your decisions are not set in stone.

But these days, more parents are connected then ever before. The benefit of this is how busy a college Freshman’s academic schedule (ahem) social calendar is, and in a world of multi-tasking, they can always find time for an electronic message but may not be able to squeeze in a phone call. The benefit to this is #1 Students can edit their entry (ie. delete the curse words) #2 They don’t have to hear Mom’s lecturing voice. #3 If inspiration strikes at 2:00am, they won’t be waking anyone up. This leads to the interesting factor of just how comfortable a teen can become in sharing details to the point where you’re left feeling sorry you ever asked about how the cafeteria food was or their roommate was doing. A normal phone call might consist of answers like: “Good. Fine. OK. Bye.” An email, text or a tweet may give explicit details about how the cafeteria oatmeal tastes like the smell of Uncle Joe’s breath after a cigar or how their roommate’s battle with excess gas during the night is subconsciously affecting their dreams. But do not fear. This is a good thing. If anything, it makes you realize you are not in control anymore. And this is the part where you let go. Trust that you’ve raised and instilled core values students will carry with them throughout college. After all, it’s part of growing up process, which both parents and students continue to experience the rest of their lives."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn for Students","Member Stories"],"author":"Guest Author","title":"How a LinkedIn Groups conversation led to an internship","date":"May 5, 2009","content":"So, I’ve been asked to write a few lines about how I use LinkedIn to search for jobs and internships. I’ll start with an example straight out of reality: Back in the beginning of the year, I took an interim class in mediation, where the professor mentioned that he had a LinkedIn group devoted to mediation and arbitration that he would be happy to let any interested students join. Of course, I bit immediately. We got to talking in class and before I knew it I had landed a clerkship (legalese for internship) with the idea that it will turn into a full time, permanent position once I'm done with school in December. Of course, I’m not saying that by you joining groups on LinkedIn employers will magically come out of the woodwork to offer you fancy positions at their firms. What I am saying is that in your quest for that elusive foot in the door you want to be where the right people are. Pick your groups and join in on the fun (or start some of your own). Show interest, initiative, and a willingness to learn.

As a result, they search for any and every possible way to narrow down the selection. “Cookie cutter” cover letter? In the trash. Only one previous internship when the position requires “one to three”? Moved to the bottom of the stack. Typo? You can forget about it. You get the idea. So, how can you make your application materials stand out? . It’s not enough to just spell everything correctly and use proper punctuation. You also have to make sure you haven’t left in another organization’s information from a previous cover letter. Have a friend or parent review every document before you hit “send.” Do you have a contact at the organization and didn’t know it? Perhaps a friend of a friend works there. Anytime you have someone who can either personally hand your résumé to the hiring manager or allow you to use his or her name in your cover letter (first paragraph—right up front), you have a leg-up over your competition. Using LinkedIn’s or is a great way to figure this out. Other options include , and other social networking sites you frequent.

Using the organization’s name and a combination of either “hiring,” “employment” and/or “jobs” will likely give you a name and title. Whether you’re in the application stage or you’ve been invited to interview, it’s important to know as much as possible about the organization.

But the short-term job outlook is more uncertain for many others and stress-levels are beginning to ratchet up. So what can you do to kick-start your career?  Here are four tips. The \"perfect\" job rarely is waiting just for you, but good ones are there to be found. Focus less on a particular job or career path and more on your marketable skills. If you are stuck in a rut and need help, check in with the career services center at your college and get help before you graduate. Or hire a professional career counselor or coach to help hone your job search skills and support you through the job search process after you graduate. Use your network to find the best possible job for you. Web-based professional business networks such as LinkedIn are great places to find out about companies, make contacts, ask questions, and get yourself known. [Not a member? Get started at the ] But don't ignore other virtual networks like Facebook and Twitter--just make sure there's nothing embarrassing or unprofessional there. Let your trusted contacts know you are looking for work. And certainly use family and friends not in your virtual networks. And speaking of family.... The boundaries within families are not always seen the same way by students and their parents. The better you know yourself, the easier it will be to draw what you need from your family to continue to grow as a responsible adult. As much as possible, take charge of the process parameters, be willing to negotiate, and avoid being too compliant or defensive. If you and your family collaborate without falling into destructive familial roles, your family can be a great source of support and job possibilities. Non-governmental organizations, some federal and state agencies, federal service programs like AmeriCorps, and the armed forces will be getting direct and indirect economic stimulus support in the next fiscal year. If you consider continuing your education later, you can earn support for graduate school and possibly forgiveness on some educational loans through AmeriCorps and military service programs. You can also learn transferable job skills that should make you a more attractive job candidate when your service is completed.

Most of the (legitimate) requests come from alumni, but current students are eligible to join the group too. Though it might seem strange to include students in a group with “alumni” in the title, creating opportunities for students and alumni to interact is beneficial to the members of the group as a whole. Students have the same group rights and privileges as alumni: they can post discussion topics, perform searches, and make connections. Recently, a student posted a request to the group; she was seeking advice regarding a non-profit she's involved with. An alumnus responded with some resources for her to explore. In examples like this one, students take advantage of the tools and become active members of the alumni community before they graduate. They establish a personal brand, learn about online networking, and make individual connections - connections they can use after they graduate, to find a job, seek advice on a business plan, or research potential employers. Conversely, alumni can establish direct connections with the next generation of graduates. Those connections keep alumni in touch with alma mater, give them an opportunity to impart their wisdom and experience, and are useful when trying to fill a vacant position. Additionally, the entire group benefits from the added connections those individual alumni and students bring to the table. The non-alumni (people connected to group members that don’t happen to be graduates of the same university) connect group members to thousands more people than a traditional, closed alumni directory would. So opening up an “alumni” space to current students means more trusted members in the group, more interaction within the group AND more potential connections beyond the alumni group, all of which add value to the individual member experience."},{"post_categories":["Jobs"],"author":"Guest Author","title":"Stop looking for a job. Start looking to meet people.","date":"April 29, 2009","content":"One of the best pieces of career advice I ever received was, “Stop looking for a job. Start looking to meet people.” During my first year in the MBA program at UC Berkeley, I was at an informal “consumption function,” our ritual Friday afternoon drinking in the courtyard. I met the wife of one of my classmates and discovered that we shared an interest in applying technology to human resources issues. She told me that her group at Intel wanted to assess different technologies, but no one had the time for such analytical work. I suggested an approach to the research, and she said, “Hey, maybe we could make this your summer internship!” I was thrilled. All of Intel’s posted summer internships were in the finance function, so I hadn’t even considered applying to the company. I’d uncovered an unforeseen positive opportunity. If you’d like to uncover unforeseen positive opportunities for your career, here are some suggestions: Set up phone and in-person meetings with people who can be helpful to you. First, do some detailed keyword searches (for example, “HR” and “technology”) and then narrow your results by geography so you find people within reasonable driving distance from your zip code. Then, find those who are most helpful and send them requests to meet for informal phone and in-person (even better) meetings. Tell them about what you share in common and ask if they would be interested in sharing ideas so you make it mutual. Find the local chapters of those organizations and attend their meetings, so you get face-to-face contact with real-life people who can talk to you about their work, the industry, the trends, and so on. See and hear and shake hands with actual people, especially in informal settings, so you can share a smile, build trust, and learn things you’d never find out by simply sitting at your computer. I also suggest using Meetup.com and Twitter to find other venues to meet people. Instead of asking people, “Do you have a job for me?” ask them “What’s the biggest problem you or your company is facing?” That’s how you start to uncover problems that you might be able to solve. Then you can offer to work on a project that leads to full-time employment. With some people you might not find a problem you can solve for their organization. Still, you’ll learn more about what’s happening in the world. Look for patterns and trends, and envision where your expertise could be useful. For each new person you meet, ask, “Can you please suggest at least two other people I who could be helpful to me?” Because most people want to be helpful, they almost will almost always share at least one additional contact. Keep following the trail of others who share your interest. After you meet these people, send a personal note of thanks and personalize a note that invites them to join your LinkedIn network. Post updates on LinkedIn about your discoveries, including links to people you’ve met, companies you’ve discovered, or new products or services you find along the way. Your new (and old) contacts will be able to see your updates and it gives them a reason to stay in touch. And of course, when you land a project or job, send out a big note of thanks and an update on your coordinates to the people who have been helpful to you. Even today, while I’m self-employed, I still make it a point to meet at least one new person a week -- usually in person, but sometimes by phone. I simply follow my curiosity or my need to learn or discover something new. Over the past five years, I’ve met over 250 new people, many of whom have shared advice, ideas, contacts, and even fantastic friendships. I’m constantly asking about people about the problems they’re facing. The question brings us closer and often opens up opportunities where we both benefit."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Guest Author","title":"Dismissing the 3 myths of job searching after graduation","date":"April 29, 2009","content":"I have recently spent a great deal of time in my office talking to students who are very confused about what their options are after graduation.  The problem is, they are limiting their options before they even get started. Students think that 1) major = job, 2)  job boards = job, and 3)  NYC (or Chicago, LA, you pick) = job.  I’d like to address these three myths. 1) Take a look at the profiles on LinkedIn and see what people really do with their majors.  A quick review of profiles for people in marketing & advertising revealed degrees in creative arts, sociology, business administration, economics and journalism.  Do some searching and see what people with your degree are doing.  Remember that as you search for jobs, the more you open yourself up to possibilities, the more you increase your chances of landing a job you that you really want.  Where might you be able to apply the skills you have learned in college? Where can you combine those skills with your interests?  Answering these questions will help you come up with some options to check out. 2) I can’t tell you the number of students I’ve met with who have told me that they have applied to everything they can find online and they aren’t even getting a response…nothing!  I ask what else they are doing and inevitably they look at me blankly, like there’s something else I should be doing?  Online job boards have done a very good job with their advertising and therefore students think that they are the keeper of all jobs.  Don’t fool yourself into thinking that you can get a job without talking to people (OK, some can, but not many).  The true value of your LinkedIn network is the opportunity to connect with these people offline, live, either on the phone or in person.  Find people who are doing what you want to do and ask them for 5-10 minutes of their time. Search out people in the companies you are interested in and do the same thing.  You will yield much better results than throwing your resume down the black hole of on-line job boards. 3) This is my favorite and probably the hardest thing for students to wrap their heads around. THERE ARE JOBS OUTSIDE THE TOP FIVE CITIES IN THE COUNTRY!  In fact, there are Austin, TX, Kansas City, MO and Salt Lake City, UT. Consider checking out a place other than where millions of other students are heading to at the same time you are, especially now when the big cities have been hardest hit by layoffs, increasing your competition exponentially. Try to look at your job search as a treasure hunt, where you have to dig to find clues to the best route to take. Keep a vision of where you want to end up and don’t worry so much about the exact steps you will have to take to get there.  Just keep in mind that your first job after college is not the biggest decision you will ever have to make in your life, it just seems that way."},{"post_categories":["Jobs"],"author":"Guest Author","title":"Forget the Economy – Stick to the Job Hunt","date":"April 29, 2009","content":"If you’re a little frightened to enter the working world in today’s economy, you’re not alone—many grads find the financial climate intimidating. But the key to landing a job in these tough times is to press on with your job hunt, and get a little creative, too. Create a strong marketing platform. Instead of fretting over what’s on CNN, arm yourself with a strong resume. If you’re not getting jobs, the economy isn’t solely to blame. Make sure you’re putting out a strongly written, error-free resume and that you practice interviewing with a friend or family member. Today’s job applicants can’t just present themselves; they have to sell themselves. So dazzle each cover letter and interview with concrete examples of why you are the best person for the job. No experience? Think about transferable skills. Explore new careers. When job hunting, recent grads need to get over the fantasy of immediately landing their dream job. This is smart advice regardless of the economy. Consider something outside of your major. For example, an English major who wants to be a journalist can apply at newspapers and magazines and consider jobs in copy writing, editing or teaching. With the economy the way it is, sometimes having a job that’s not spot-on is better than having no job at all…just make sure it provides a solid foundation for your career. Limit job-hunting time. Certainly you should devote time and energy—and use every resource—to get a job. But everyone needs a break. Hunt in spurts and take a rest when need be.

Only if it meets your career goals and only if you report to someone else. It’s tricky. Read some books on family businesses. 4. Need start-up cash or insurance? Ask for monetary graduation gifts. Beyond six months after graduation, make business-like loan agreements with your parents, and share your budget. 5. College loans! Don’t trap yourself by taking the first job, just to make payments. The loans were for you to seriously enter the job market, not just work to pay them off. 1. Expect a transition period of a month or so. Procrastination doesn’t mean necessarily mean being stuck. 2. Your best lines:” What can I do to support you right now?” or “Do you want some contacts?” 3. Your greatest gift: expressed confidence in your graduate, even if you have doubts. 4. Please don’t nag or criticize (“Haven’t you filled that out yet?”). Instead, offer a story about how you once helped yourself with feeling discouraged, or stuck. 5.

Here are four quick and easy ideas:  Movies, Games, Skis, anything you don’t plan to use more than once or twice, or that you don’t need to use more than once a month.  This can include cars if you live in a city with good public transit.  Libraries are even cheaper.  If you ski every weekend, on the other hand, buying can be more economical.  With the exception of electronics, the newest, cutting-edge models aren’t that different from last year, except for the higher price tag.  You don’t have to drive your dad’s 1983 Datsun, or buy all your clothes at Value Village, but getting your skates used, or buying a 3-year-old vehicle still under warranty will get you by without sacrificing much style or performance.  You don’t need a land-line and a cell.  You also don’t need the full “bells and whistles” phone plan.  You don’t need a laptop and desktop at home, and one TV is plenty – and no, there’s nothing good on the 300 extra channels that come with the HD package, either.

This may or may not be true, but if you are feeling nervous and scared about them finding a job, then they are probably feeling it even worse. Be sensitive to the fact that they might not be showing you how vulnerable they really feel. You can ask once or twice in a few day period if your child needs help. If they say no, back off, they might need their space, otherwise they might feel you are nagging them, What is or was best for you in the job search might be different for them. Try to be aware of their needs and interests when helping them search for a job so they can find something they are truly fulfilled with.  I have heard many of my friends who are out of work complain that their parents think that job searching should be 'easier with the Internet' or it is the same as when they were younger.

Networks open doors to the best expertise, to essential technology, and to financial resources that have a huge impact. We know that malaria can be stopped with simple tools like medicines, indoor sprays and mosquito nets. Momentum is building to end malaria deaths by 2015 - an ambitious goal, but achievable. As I mentioned earlier, it just requires the power of your network. To commemorate World Malaria Day today, I’m asking the LinkedIn network for help. My question to you is: - increase public awareness in donor nations and in Africa - advocate for political support around the world and especially in Africa - make leveraged investments in Africa that help save lives Click to answer my question, and then continue the conversation in our LinkedIn group, . The group provides a forum for us to mobilize hundreds or (maybe) thousands of professionals in our networks to make a difference in the fight against malaria. There you can share your ideas, collaborate and take action with others who refuse to accept another death from malaria.

If you arm yourself with a well-written, professionally formatted resume which highlights your achievements, skills and experience, you will boost your chances of gaining valuable interviews. To differentiate yourself from other college grads or entry-level applicants, keep the following tips in mind. Try not to use a vague objective statement that only talks about you. For example: “To join a progressive organization where I can expand my skills in selling and communications” is only about YOU, the candidate. You might instead want to lead with the following: “Enthusiastic graduate with demonstrated initiative, creativity, strong communication skills and real-life business experience conducive to making measurable contributions in a marketing setting.” You are then giving the reader a better understanding of what you can offer them vs. what you want. When listing your education, don’t forget about relevant coursework, classroom projects and/or school involvement that shows your leadership skills including raising money for a cause, contributing in a hands-on or real-world classroom experience. If you were recognized for academic achievement, list those as well. Internships are also very important, even if they are not relevant to your target position. When you talk about your internships, you let the reader know that you take your future career seriously. As for any employment, don’t list just your duties – think about how you contributed including how you increased sales, improved customer service or enhanced process, i.e., a more efficient way of doing things. Don’t forget to customize your cover letters and send a thank you note after every interview, reiterating a key topic or two that you discussed. Many people forget this important step, and if the company has narrowed the search to just a few candidates including you, this one step might make the difference."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn for Students","LinkedIn Tips"],"author":"Guest Author","title":"Research on LinkedIn.

And the current recession means more of them ever before will still be looking for that first job after graduation, and it may not be the one that they and their parents expected would launch their careers. But the market is not as bleak as the unemployment reports would suggest. There are many things that parents can do to help new grads and I will suggest a few that pertain primarily to parents. But first I have a suggestion to those readers who know parents who struggle with (or ignore) the fact that their grad has really grown up. (I know you are not one of them.) Gently remind them that, \"college graduates are responsible adults--even when they are your kids\". Because if they forget, they may find that their good intentions may do more long-term harm than good. If you believe they might struggle to suspend parental authority, you might even suggest that they adopt a mantra like, \"My child is a college graduate. My child is a responsible adult.\" It works! So, what can parents do to help? Here are five of my top choices. 1. Set and agree to ground rules like, \"you can move in for three months rent free, then you pay $XXX rent/month.\" Every situation is different and the rules may need to be negotiated as time goes by. 2. Challenge your grads to come up with plans and solutions. Provide information and suggestions that you think would be helpful in a job search. Then let them finalize the plan. Always collaborate. Share your opinions, but don't be condescending. If you disagree with their decisions, let them know what you think, but as long as the ground rules are not violated, support the plan. 3. Become a link in their job search network. If you are reading this, you probably have a network on LinkedIn. Offer your child the opportunity to become another connection into your network. At least suggest . 4. Tell you children you love them--regularly. If you or they are uncomfortable sharing feelings through words, at least show it in your eyes and your smile. 5. Suggest expert help. If the job search is going smoothly, great! If not, consider suggesting seeking out the help of a professional career counselor or coach."},{"post_categories":["Jobs"],"author":"Guest Author","title":"Stop Job Hunting Like It’s 1999! Dos and Don’ts for ’09 Grads","date":"April 23, 2009","content":"Job hunting is a journey, so I’d like to begin this post by paraphrasing from my favorite movie about a journey: The Wizard of Oz: We’re not in the 20th Century anymore, Toto. This is the sentence I find myself thinking whenever a college student says something like, “I’ve sent out, like, a hundred resumes and I still haven’t found a job!”. Emailing out resumes and waiting for a response used to be a perfectly decent strategy for finding a job. Not anymore. Today’s job seekers, especially ‘09 grads job hunting in a recession, need to be than ever before. We are blessed to live in a time when there are so many new job hunting tools and techniques. Take advantage! Here are some tips: · . The line between personal and professional is pretty fluid these days, and that’s a good thing for job seekers. Your network can and should include friends and family. (That’s right; there is no shame in “linking in” with your parents!) It’s important to email and talk to everyone you know—friends, family, professors, neighbors—to ask if they know anyone who might be hiring. Now is the perfect time to reach out and say, “I’m excited to share the news that I’ve graduated. I’m in the process of job hunting and would be grateful for any advice you have or introductions you’d be willing to make…” · . In today’s super-fast world, a job can be snapped up based on something as brief and fleeting as a 140-character “tweet” or a status update , so you must move fast. If you see a job announcement, discussion topic, scholarship announcement or any opportunity that appeals to you, go for it immediately. When I post opportunities or questions, I am always most impressed and intrigued by the person who responds first. · . There are many great tips on for networking on LinkedIn, and I’d add another important use: research. LinkedIn offers a huge database of other people’s career paths, from which you can gather ideas for your own. Search other people's profiles to find new companies you may want to apply to, job titles or professions you didn't know about, organizations where you can network and people with similar interests who might be willing to offer some advice. Simply type your interests or dream employers into the , read the profiles that pop up and open your mind to new possibilities. · . There is a perception that younger people are only comfortable communicating online, so it's especially important for recent college grads to demonstrate that they are also comfortable face-to-face, eyeball-to-eyeball (where much of the action takes place in the professional world you’re trying to join). This means that in addition to networking and job hunting online, it’s crucial that you set up live phone calls or coffee dates, attend “meet-ups,” job fairs and conferences and send snail mail notes to people who help you. Remember that online methods should supplement, not replace, in-person techniques. · . Do you open mail addressed to “Occupant?” No way. This is the same way recruiters feel about emails written “To whom it may concern” and generic LinkedIn connection requests. Show you’re not lazy by customizing every communication with the recruiter’s name (spelled correctly – triple check!) and a reminder of where you met, a topic you chatted about or, if you’ve never met, a brief introduction of who you are. You’ll impress people with your etiquette and you’ll demonstrate that you are a young professional who goes the extra mile. Good luck on your journey, ’09 grads. Stay positive, work hard and I’ll look forward to seeing you along the Yellow Brick Road!"},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn for Students","Jobs"],"author":"Guest Author","title":"Advice from a financial strategist on paying off student debt","date":"April 21, 2009","content":"[ : ] The toughest thing for a new grad when paying down debts is finding the money. Here are two steps to take that can help ensure the funds you seek are available. :  It’s the oldest trick in the book, and we’re all tired of hearing it, but just as with many a “tired old standard,” we repeat it because it’s true. Go over your bank statements (keeping a spending diary is even better) and put together a budget based around 3 priorities: If there’s anything left after that, you can spend it how you like.  Make sure you have some money for fun stuff.  Debt repayment is like losing weight. If you cut out all the things you enjoy, you’ll binge and blow your diet, and wind up worse off than before. :  Pay for everything each day in cash. When you come home each night, drop what’s left in your pockets into a piggy bank. At the end of a set period of time (month, year, etc.) count what’s in the piggy, and use it for big expenses (holiday or birthday shopping), or for extra payments on the loan. To make this more effective, refuse to spend coins during the day.

Then, last summer, LinkedIn got a huge face lift and I noticed that so many people were using this site, and it started to get me thinking that I should get on the LinkedIn wave. I completed my account and started noticing more requests to friend users, including hiring managers. One day, out of the blue, while working at my internship a representative from Microsoft sent me an InMail and asked if I was interested in working for a new division of the company this year. I told them I was still in school, and I was out of the market until 2009 (which was my standard reply to many of the companies who saw me as graduated from undergraduate study). Despite this, they still said \"let's have you meet up with someone at the new division\" so a few weeks later, I was having breakfast with the VP of Engineering at Microsoft's new Boston office. He liked what he saw and rushed to get me an interview before the wave of college interviews across the country. At the end of the summer, I already had passed a phone screening and was scheduled for an interview the first of September, weeks before regular hiring began. About a week later, I was offered an amazing job at Microsoft in Boston, and it wouldn't have happened without LinkedIn.

Even if they were, the odds of them finding you versus other qualified candidates with profiles is like the old needle in the haystack.

Use the same action-oriented words that you’d use in a resume. Include hotlinks to direct searches to places you’ve worked, papers you’ve written, roles in the school play anything that makes you look like a do-er. : Even if you don’t know them personally, there’s a blood bond between alumni that can run pretty deep. They’re likely to answer and often point you in the right direction. : Look up Sprint or Verizon on LinkedIn, for example. You might find a hometown or a mutual friend connection. : They’re online because they want you to find them. Be upfront and let them know that you’re looking for a job, not a friend. : I knew a graduate who wanted to design environmentally friendly food packaging but wasn’t getting much response. He began a blog that revealed his packaging philosophy. It attracted his employer. : Most corporations are blogging now. So, for example, if you want a job at Intel read some of the Intel blogs and express your opinion or ask a question.

Not so. The fact is, many students associate their campus careers office with on-campus recruiting, and now that the formal recruiting cycle is over, they assume their careers office can no longer help. Nothing could be further from the truth. You may be tempted to stick your head in the sand while you enjoy your last few weeks of undergraduate bliss, but there are powerful reasons to squeeze the last few drops out of your tuition-funded career services. When the economy is in trouble, employers get nervous--particularly when they have had to eliminate positions. They can’t predict in advance how many college grads they will need to hire, so instead of coming to career fairs, they postpone recruiting until they have an immediate need. Employers will spread the word about vacancies locally, but if they want recent grads, they will also contact college careers offices—no matter what time of year the vacancy occurs. Job listings are often accessible through college web-based recruiting systems like e-Recruiting or NACELink, but you can also find careers staff who know who’s hiring, and which employers are experiencing significant growth. In many universities, you can sign up to be sent job vacancy notices by the careers office.  Let your careers office know you’re actively looking for work, and ask what steps you can take to keep in the employment loop. Your first job will not be your last. Within your first five years of graduation, you’re likely to have 2-3 jobs and even change your mind about your chosen career field.  So it makes sense to learn how employers think and how you can best present your knowledge, skills and abilities (what employers call your KSA), both in written documents and in an interview.  It will save you hours of time in the future.  If you’ve been avoiding writing a resume and cover letter, now is the time to make an appointment with a career advisor to get template documents critiqued. You’ll need to customize them for every position, but make sure you know the basics. Parents and peers may be happy to give you advice, but this is an area where a professional opinion can pay off, big time.  Many colleges will provide alumni career services, but they often cut off your access to some of the most useful databases, like Career Search or Career Beam, within a couple of months of graduation—just when you have the time to make the most of them. The careers office isn’t doing this to spite you; contracts are typically based on your status as a student or a graduate. Explore these resources now and find out when your access ends. If you’re about to be cut off, do your career research now, and map out a plan of action for your career search later. The old “Placement Office” is dead. Careers offices in 2009 will rarely find you a job. But that’s not bad news.  To paraphrase the old Woody Allen quote, “You wouldn’t want a job that the Careers office would want you to have”.  What the Careers office should be able to do is to identify employers, alumni or other resources, like LinkedIn, through which you can investigate career fields, fine-tune your career direction, and identify employment opportunities. Careers staff can help you figure out which resources or people would be most helpful, given your specific needs, and train you in how to make the most of these opportunities. It’s a rare graduate who knows in her freshman year what she wants to do when she graduates, and is still in the same position in the same organization thirty years later. Most current graduates can look forward to years of navigating the careers landscape before settling on a particular direction. If you make the most of your Careers office while you’re still in school, you will learn the skills that will serve you well for a lifetime of job change and career success."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn for Students","LinkedIn Tips"],"author":"Guest Author","title":"How to use LinkedIn to find internships (by a college undergrad)","date":"April 22, 2009","content":"Finding a good internship was difficult and frustrating for me.

I wanted to know: what made a good internship, how I could set myself apart from thousands like me, and how I could find those opportunities some people are able to find?  I was able to answer all of these questions by using LinkedIn and a little enthusiasm. Here are four things LinkedIn helped me do: :  The question & answer function was a great tool to ask for advice or any specific questions for a specific industry or job. The first time I asked a question I received seven answers. One of these answers gave me a contact which lead to a recent interview I would have never found otherwise. : When choosing which company is right for you, LinkedIn’s company tab is a great place for research. I like to look at present or former employees’ profiles and send them messages or get introduced to learn more about the company or to develop a good recommendation.  : To increase my chances of landing a job, I looked through my contacts to see if I could find people who were in a relevant company, in a prominent position, or even shared similar interests.

Fast forward to today. I speak at many different colleges and to my surprise, not every student knows what LinkedIn is, so I always have to take time to give a summary of LinkedIn, its value and benefits. I really emphasize why it’s  become one of the most important recruiting tools in the world and the majority of “good” headhunters have already signed up.  LinkedIn, to me, has become the ultimate database of relationships and since networking is the key to getting anywhere in life, it’s significant to my professional development.  It’s given me an avenue to connect with professionals and has helped position me as a leading personal branding expert. Here are five tips on using a professional networking site like LinkedIn to build your personal and professional brand on the web: Out of all the features on LinkedIn, I think the groups feature reigns supreme.  It positions you as an expert and, just like people who start events; it makes you the center of information and the “connector.”  I started the Personal Branding Network on LinkedIn about a month or so ago and have already built it up to 841 users!  The value I’ve received out of this group is tremendous and now I spend less time updating the group because it’s generated a powerful community that support’s its growth. I know that people use this tip all the time, but it’s important to repeat it because you don’t want to appear that you don’t do much.  If you’ve had a lot of great work experience, then use all of it.  Take your current resume and use all the fields in your LinkedIn profile, so that you can stand out. For personal branding, you need to attach everything on the web to your full name and LinkedIn has vanity URL’s that you can use to help you control your Google results.  LinkedIn, as a major website, as a high Google PageRank and gives you the ability to make a linkedin.com/in/yourfullname URL, which typically ranks very high for your name. When applications first came out, I was praying that it wouldn’t be like how Facebook did it and I was right.  I find great value in two of the applications LinkedIn currently supports: Wordpress blog RSS and Slideshare.net. Having your blog syndicate through your profile is valuable to showing employers that you’re already writing about topics you’re interested in and a Slideshare presentation also makes you look like you’re contributing great value. Your LinkedIn profile you should with you as you build profiles on other social networks, your website, blogs, etc.  I tell a lot of people to use their LinkedIn profile URL on their traditional resume, and as the one link they have on Twitter, if they don’t have a blog.  LinkedIn profiles are easy to read and are focused on your professional careers, so using the URL everywhere is a great idea for you."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Tips"],"author":"Guest Author","title":"What recruiters look for in a LinkedIn profile: 8 tips","date":"April 9, 2009","content":"Do not fret.

Given my experience looking for candidates, here are some key characteristics of a LinkedIn user that grab my attention when I make my daily picks: •    Include all companies, education, and awards. These are the key items on which we recruiters search. •    References are very important. The more we know about you the better. •    The more robust your profile, the higher you will be in the Google search rankings. •    The more information a recruiter has upfront, the more efficient the search process. •    Update your LinkedIn profile •    A picture helps to create and reinforce your online brand •    It will help a recruiter identify you on the interview day at “Starbucks” •    Add a profile picture here •    List as many keywords as possible that are relevant to your roles, capabilities, and interests that will help you turn up on LinkedIn Search •    Update your profile summary and specialties here •    Link to articles you have written or in which you are quoted •    Update status with your latest blog posts •    Discuss business accomplishments •    If you are actively looking for a job, tell people what you are looking for! •    Update your status on other social networking sites such as Twitter. Try services like ping.fm that allow you to update your status across multiple sites. •    The recruiters you are linked to will notice these changes •    It is harder to be found if people don’t know where you are •    Update your LinkedIn profile as you would your change-of-address at the post office •    Add suitable weblinks to the \"Websites\" section on your LinkedIn profile •    This could range from your career blog to your Twitter profile. Alternatively, you can also link to a guest blog post you wrote recently. •    Update your \"Websites\" section here •    No matter how popular you think you are, you will not be overwhelmed. I promise! •    The LinkedIn community is all about participation so feel free to accept incoming communication from fellow LinkedIn users. Update your contact settings . •    If a recruiter reaches out to you and you are not interested, let him or her know or better yet refer a friend •    LinkedIn actually allows you to control how you receive emails and notifications. Update your settings . •    Use to bring your real world professional relationships online and to find your contacts who are already on LinkedIn. •    Depending on whether you're a browser person or an Outlook person, check out the that will help organize your professional relationship either while you browse or check out your Inbox. These are just a few tips that I've gleaned from my LinkedIn usage over the past year.

In this entry I will talk about what how Voldemort works, and what features we will be adding to it. With Voldemort we hope to scale both the amount of data we can store and the number of requests for that data. Naturally the only way to do this is to spread both the load and the data across many servers. But spreading across servers creates two key problems: 1.   You must find a way to split the data up the data so that no one server has to store everything 2.   You must find a way to handle server failures without interrupting service The first point is fairly obvious—if you want to handle more requests you need more machines, if you want to handle more data, you need more disks and memory (and servers to hold the disks and memory). But there are still a number of subtleties. Any system that doesn’t maintain local state, can easily be scaled by just making more copies of it and using a hardware load balance to randomly distribute requests over the machines. Since the whole point of a storage system is to store things, this becomes somewhat more difficult: if we randomly distribute writes then the data will be different on each machine, if we write to every machine then we will potentially have dozens of machines to update on each write. In order to effectively use all the machines, the data in Voldemort is split-up amongst the servers in such a way that each item is stored on multiple machines (the user specifies how many). This means that you have to first figure out which is the correct server to use. This partitioning is done via a that let’s any server calculate the location of data without doing any expensive look ups. This kind of partitioning is commonly done to improve the performance of write requests (since without it, every single server would have to be updated every time you did a write). What is not commonly understood is that this is also required to improve read performance. Memory access is thousands of times faster than disk access, so the ratio of memory to data is the critical factor for accessing the performance of a storage system. By partitioning the data you increase this ratio by shrinking the data on each machine. Another way to think of this is as improving cache locality—if requests are randomly balanced over all machines then “hot” items end up in cache on all servers and the hit ratio is fairly low, by partitioning the storage among machines the cache hit ratio dramatically improves. To handle this problem any distributed system must do some kind of failure detection. Typically this is done by some kind of heart-beat mechanism—each server pings some master co-ordination nodes (or each other) to say “Hi, I am still alive!” In the simple case if a node fails to ping for some time then it is assumed to be dead. But this raises a few problems, first there aren’t any master nodes in the Voldemort cluster, each node is a peer—so what if one server gets a ping and another does not? Then the servers will have a differing view of who is and is not alive. In fact, maintaining the state about who is alive is the exact same distributed state management problem we were trying to solve in the first place. The second problem is a bit more existential: what does it mean to be alive? Indeed, just because a server is alive enough to say “hi!” or “ping!” doesn’t mean you are alive enough to correctly service requests with low latency. One solution is to increase the complexity of the ping message to include a variety of metrics on the server’s performance, and then make the prediction as to whether that server is alive or not. But what we do is much simpler. Since Voldemort only has a few types of request (PUT, GET, DELETE, etc.) and since each server is getting hundreds of these requests per second, why invent a new ping request to detect liveness? Instead, since each of these requests has similar performance, it makes sense to simply set an SLA (service level agreement) for the requests and ban servers who cannot meet their SLA (this could be because they are down, because requests are timing out, or many other reasons). Servers that violate this SLA get banned for a short period of time, after which we attempt to restore them (which may lead the them getting banned again). This is a fairly simple mechanism for the user of Voldemort to use, since they may have their own SLA they need to maintain (i.e. serve 99% of the pages in less than 100ms or something like that). The simplicity of the query model actually becomes something of an advantage in this kind of performance analysis. The three Voldemort queries have known performance, so it is very easy to predict the load a new feature will generate by just counting the number of requests. This is always a challenge with SQL: poorly designed SQL queries may produce thousands of times more load. Compounding this problem, distinguishing the bad queries from the good requires knowing both the index structure and the data on which it will run—neither of which is present in your code—so it easy for an efficiency to slip past even a diligent review if you don’t perform real tests on real data for each modification to see what query plan will be generated. The redundancy of storage makes the system more resilient to server failure. Since each value is stored N times, you can tolerate as many as N - 1  machine failures without data loss. This causes other problems, though. Since each value is stored in multiple places it is possible that one of these servers will not get updated (say because it is crashed when the update occurs). To help solve this problem Voldemort uses a data versioning mechanism called Vector Clocks that are common in distributed programming. This is an idea we took from Amazon’s Dynamo system. This data versioning allows the servers to detect stale data when it is read and repair it. The first advantage of this mechanism is that it does not require a consistent view of which servers are working and which are not. If server A cannot get to server C, but server B can get to C that will not break the versioning system. This kind of failure can be especially common in the case of transient failures. Another advantage relates to challenges faced with expanding data centers. Requests between data centers that are physically remote have much higher latency then requests within a data center (10 or 100x slower depending on geography). With most storage systems it isn't possible to take concurrent writes across multiple data centers without risk of losing data, since if two updates occur at once, one in each data center, there is no principled way for the storage system to choose between them. By versioning the data you can allow the results to be resolved or the conflict to be given back to the application for resolution. I should probably also mention how it got its name, since that is something I got a lot of questions about. I wanted to come up with a name that was distinctive and a little self-deprecating (projects shouldn't take themselves too seriously). At the time I was reading the last Harry Potter book, and Voldemort had split himself into many pieces each of which had to be destroyed to kill him. I thought, \"that sounds like a distributed system\". I don't know whether it is nerdier to be reading Harry Potter or to be wondering what kind of consistency protocol Voldemort uses when keeping all his pieces up-to-date, but regardless, the name stuck.

The best way to do that is to make sure you are using the full power of LinkedIn to maximize your employment potential. Here are ten tips on optimizing your job hunting experience on LinkedIn: . The first step is to make sure your LinkedIn Profile is complete.  The more detailed your LinkedIn profile, the more chances you will have to be found and to be contacted. This is important because your profile is what you use to connect with people how you get found on LinkedIn.  Complete your LinkedIn profile as carefully as you write your resume and provide prospective employers with detailed information on your skills and experience.  If you’re currently unemployed, list your current position as \"Open to opportunities\". If you don't have a LinkedIn profile, . . You can add a photo (a head shot is recommended) to your LinkedIn profile. Note that the photo can be no larger than 80x80 pixels.  Do make sure your photo represents the professional you, not the personal you, because LinkedIn is all about professional networking. . The Professional Summary section of your profile is a good way to highlight your experience. Select an Industry, because recruiters often use that field to search. Don't forget the Headline, because that's right at the top of the page when someone views your profile. It’s your first chance to make a good impression. . Include the keywords and skills from your resume in your profile. This will make it easier for your profile to be found in search results. . Your contact settings let your connections (and hiring managers and recruiters) know your availability. Options include: career opportunities, consulting offers, new ventures, job inquiries, and reference requests. Even if you're not actively seeking a new job, it's important to be flexible, because you never know when an opportunity to good to pass up might come along. . The Links section of your profile is a good way to provide even more information to potential employers and to your contacts.  If you have blog or a personal web site that is business related, include those links in the Links section of your profile. . LinkedIn Applications are a terrific way to share even more information in your profile. The blog applications enable users to feed their blog directly to their profile, so other LinkedIn users can see the most current posts automatically. . Don't forget to make your profile public - that's how the world can find it.  Also, customizing your URL will give you a link that's easy to share. . Connect with other members and build your network. You can find connections you’ve worked with, done business with, went to school with, or are otherwise affiliated with. The more connections you have, the more opportunities you have, but don't randomly connect with people you don't know. The point is to connect with people you do know, so they can help you and vice versa. . To a potential employer, a LinkedIn recommendation is an opportunity to read a reference in advance. Having strong references can only help you when it comes to getting selected for an interview or for a job.  The best way to get recommendations is to give them, so take some time to write recommendations for your contacts and they will most likely reciprocate."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Tips","LinkedIn for Good"],"author":"Guest Author","title":"Using LinkedIn status updates for good | Craig Newmark","date":"April 3, 2009","content":"[ : ] Okay, I look at social media/networking sites, particularly Facebook and LinkedIn.

I wanted to give a little more information about what it is good for, how it came to be, and what our plans are for the future. Like a lot of websites, LinkedIn started with a single big database and a cluster of front-end servers (unlike a lot of websites it also started out with a big social graph in memory on remote machines, but that is a different story). As we grew, this database got split into a variety of remote services for serving up profiles, performing searches, interacting with groups, maintaining network updates, fetching companies, etc. These databases may have read-only replicas, but we didn't have a system for scaling writes. Unfortunately for engineers and DBAs, many of the rich features that people expect from a modern internet site either require massive data sets or high write loads, or both. This became a problem as we looked at how to scale some write-intensive features like Who’s Viewed My Profile that require as many updates as reads. We faced a similar scale problem for offline computed data, such as finding similar profiles—the set of all user profiles is very large, but even a modest subset of the set of all user profile pairs is quite huge. To handle this problem we looked at the systems other internet companies had built. We really like Google's , but we didn't think it made sense to try to build it if you didn't have access to a low-latency GFS implementation. Our primary goal was to get low-latency, high-availability access to our data. For complex analysis we had Hadoop and databases, for complex queries we had a distributed search system, and the goal wasn't to try to duplicate any of these. We were inspired by , which seemed to meet the needs we have as well as being feasible to implement with low-latency queries--much of our design for Project Voldemort comes from that. Our experience with the system so far has been quite good. We were able to move applications that needed to handle hundreds of millions of reads and writes per day from over 400ms to under 10ms while simultaneously increasing the amount of data we store. LinkedIn is a big open source user, and we have contributed back a number of the improvements to Lucene we have made such as , , and . Most of the things we build are pretty LinkedIn-specific, but things like search and storage are pretty much stand-alone and we are happy to get other users (and contributors!). I myself have been a long-time open source lurker—I am the first to check out the source, but rarely have the time to make any improvements. Fortunately, even if most people are as lazy as me, not all are. In the last few months we have got close to 50 contributions from people around the world. Some are small, just doing a little cleanup, and others have been quite substantial introducing new features or major code improvements. The long-term success of an open source project depends on its not being controlled by a single company, person, group, but forming a real self-sustaining group of interested developers. This is our goal in working on the open source project. LinkedIn is not a storage systems company, and neither are the other web companies facing some of the same problems, so we think we think we can all benefit by sharing our work in this area. So what is next for the project? The most important feature for a storage system is always improving performance and reliability. But there are a couple of other things in the works. We are working on making it easier to incrementally add to clusters of servers, improving our support for batch computed data from Hadoop, and implementing some clients in other programming languages.

You only get one chance to make a first impression and for nearly 300 years has been the primary tool for transferring business information to new contacts in a universal and memorable format. Even today, in the exciting, digital world of LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, this simple, tactile product goes from strength to strength. Indeed, the more digital the world becomes, the more powerful useful offline tools like business cards become. They may only be little but it's what you do with them that counts. As a serious platform for promoting your business, I'm often surprised by how unremarkable people choose to make their business cards. They are, after all, the ultimate direct marketing tool - something that your potential customer or client is given in person, takes away, and hopefully keeps forever. Here are my top 10 tips for creating remarkable and memorable business cards; cards that will help you and your business stand out in these difficult economic times. Whether you are having your cards designed by a graphic designer, or creating the look yourself, take some time to plan your cards.  Look at the cards you've collected over the years to see what elements you like, and incorporate them into your design. Your business card may be the first and last thing a contact remembers you by, so make sure you are really happy with them. (Browse our and for some great ideas and design tips) Your card should say something about who you are/what you do.  It should be personal and show off the scope of what you do, and be easily recognisable as YOUR card.  When the recipient is flicking through their Rolodex, your card should jump out and remind them of you. Your cards should be remarkable.  They should spark interest and should prompt further questions about your cards, your business, yourself.  Use a bold image, statement or novel shape to grab attention - don't be shy, this is all about attention.  Don't let the exchange of your business card be the end of a conversation, but rather the beginning of one. It should stand out from the crowd and make an impact. Are you handing your card to an existing client, a headhunter, a stranger? Tailor your card to the recipients to maximise the effect.  Hand over a card that demonstrates your awareness of who THEY are, and what they might find interesting about you and your business.  Take an interest in who they are and they'll take more notice of who you are. Are these cards for you to take to meetings, leave on tables or pass out at events or trade shows.  The different environments that you might want to use business cards should affect the look and purpose.  If you are handing them over you can use your charm (!) to complete the story that your cards start to tell.  If you are leaving them to be found, you'll need to tell the whole story in the card.  And if you are at a trade event, use them as promotional tools to give discounts, send people to your website and grab attention. Your card should make an impression both to the eye and in the hand.  Impress your contacts by handing over a card that feels great as well as looks great. A thick, smooth stock or using a recycled, pure stock, with highest quality printing can make a long-lasting impression. Your card should make it easy for someone to follow up and contact you.  Provide correct contact details in a clear, legible way.  Don't over-clutter with unnecessary information (e.g every social network you have ever joined up to), but make sure that a potential client knows how to find you. There's no point in handing out cards with old information, images or product news.  Use your cards as an indication of what you are up to at the moment.  If you have a new product or service, showcase it on your cards.  If you use them as sales tools, but no longer stock the product or offer the service, make new cards. Order your cards in short, inexpensive runs to make sure you don't lose money by having piles of out of date cards. Don't forget to recycle the old ones though! The Japanese have an established, formal etiquette for handing over cards in order to set the right tone.  You don't need to go that far, but do think about how YOU come across when handing out your card. Make sure you look presentable and smile and make eye contact.  Though it sounds silly, it can make a big different to being remembered.  Also think about how you take out your card.  Rather than dragging them out of a suit pocket or the bottom of your bag, why not carry a smart card holder to keep your cards neat and clean and make a good impression when handing them over. There's no point in making the most beautiful cards to then keep them in a desk drawer - get them out there.  Keep a stock of cards in your briefcase or bag at all times.  When you go to a meeting or event, hand the cards out to anyone and everyone.  You never know who will be the person to follow up, so give yourself the best chance possible."},{"post_categories":["Product News","New LinkedIn Features"],"author":"Mario Sundar","title":"Changes to your Inbox on the homepage","date":"March 23, 2009","content":"Some of you may have noticed the change to how and when your inbox shows up on your homepage: it will only appear when you have unread messages - but your inbox and your read messages are always available from the left navigation bar on the homepage.

A bundle is nothing more than a jar file with extra manifest information. Here is a 'typical' example of a manifest for an OSGi bundle (the entries in bold are the OSGi specific headers). This is how you instruct the OSGi container about your dependencies ( ), what you provide ( ), how you become active ( ), etc... So why did I start this post by saying it was a problem ? The answer is actually two-fold: In this post I will be concentrating on problem #2 and I will come back to problem #1 in a later post. Let's start with some numbers. As of this writing (January 2009), our repository of external libraries contains 200 jar files. Only 8 of them are bundles out of the box (4%). I believe that this small sample reflects the harsh reality out there: over 95% of the available libraries are not bundle. The answer is unfortunately not that easy. For starters, you should definitely check the that they are offering for free. It contains a good list of libraries that have been converted to bundles (they even have a full time employee just for this ongoing task!). One of the big issue is that it is hard to keep up with as new libraries are popping up on a daily basis include snapshots. It's benefits are debatable but in practice, sometimes you just don't have a choice! In our case, we just cannot afford to rely solely on the availability of bundles. So here is the approach that we took: What we are trying to achieve is to convert a repository of libraries (96% jar files (blue)) into a repositories of bundles (100% bundles (red)). For this we use bnd, ivy and some custom code. Our repository of external libraries is using ivy for dependency management (note that the process would be very similar with maven). Using ivy resolution, it is relatively easy to build the (non cyclic) graph of dependencies between all the libraries. All the leaves represent libraries that do not have dependencies on other libraries (Step1). is a tool that analyzes a jar file and can create OSGi manifest headers. In Step 2, we iterate over each leaf and we feed it to bnd to generate a bundle as a result. We use some custom code (ant tasks) to have more control over what is provided as input to bnd and the errors/warnings that we need. In Step 3, we repeat the same process one level up the dependency graph. This time we know we are dealing with libraries that have dependencies, but we also know that they have properly been converted into bundles, so the classpath (which is one of the input to bnd) will contain only proper bundles. With the proper classpath, bnd will be able to generate the proper manifest entries (the and attributes of the entries will be correct). And recursively we go all the way up the chain of dependencies until we have converted the entire repository. Overall this process works quite well but there are several issues that I want to point out: The last point I wanted to raise is my concern that there isn't a 'one-size-fits-all' repository. Even with the amazing work that SpringSource is doing with the free repository, you get their interpretation of dependencies. For example, the jdom bundle (version 1.0) has the following entry: Import-Package: org.jaxen;version=\"[1.1.1, 2.0.0)\";resolution:=\"optional\" The above entry basically means that jdom depends optionally on org.jaxen package version 1.1.1 all the way to 2.0.0 not included. This may work for you or not depending on your needs. In our case we like tighter version ranges ( ). What if jaxen v.1.2.3 ends up having a show-stopper bug when used in conjunction with jdom but you still need it for other parts of your code and you end up deploying it in the same container ? Stay tuned for a separate post entirely dedicated to version management soon.

The LA Times recently some good and bad examples of farewell communication and their direct consequences: Some farewell e-mails strike a lighthearted, even funny tone. Some are workmanlike and short. Others are poetic or poignant, expressing surprise or regret at the turn of events. A very few -- and these are the ones that get most of the attention -- use the electronic goodbye to blast the boss. Given that many professionals unfortunately are forced to deal with layoffs these days, I asked my colleague and in-house career expert - , on what she thought were some \"Farewell communication\" best practices. I couldn't agree more with Krista's suggestion on using Status to either replace or augment the old school way of saying goodbye to your old company. Here are some quick thoughts on how employees, either laid off or in between jobs, can use status updates to communicate effectively during those times of change. The tone of a relevant status update, especially on professional networking sites like LinkedIn can be best exemplified by Richard Bravo. A former managing editor of the Daily News Record (DNR), Richard was laid off three days short of his anniversary, as a result of which his severance was credited at two years. Here's what Richard emailed his connections: He was straightforward and brief: \"I apologize for the mass e-mail, but today's issue of DNR will be the last. . . . We folded last week and are now on 'forced vacation' to put it nicely. . . . If you need to get in touch with me please use this info.\" I think a status update such as the one above, would have been an equally effective way to get that message out to your professional network. Not only is such a 140 char. status message succinct, but it's also highly effective in soliciting your connections' support in helping you find that new job. In Richard's case, his farewell email yielded \"a number of freelance assignments\". Stay tuned for more examples of how a LinkedIn Status message could help find a job. However, one of the most important purposes of a \"farewell email\" has traditionally been to re-establish a line of contact with past colleagues and friends. In days past, an email may have been the best way to communicate that, but increasingly you'll find that status updates are a great way to announce the transition. Now that thousands of people are finding themselves with pink slips and the need to let colleagues and contacts know they are moving on and -- perhaps more important for job seekers -- how they can be reac Farewell status updates also provide you an easy way to stay in touch with your connections irrespective of the email addresses you use. So, even when your email address changes as you move from one job to another, being connected with them on LinkedIn helps maintain that connection. An added benefit of using status vs. a mass email to broadcast your professional move is it's impermanence. If you decide your status could be worded better, you can always delete or modify that and start afresh. And, finally, status updates are a low-touch way to allow interested connections to check out your message without pushing your mass email out to thousands who may view it as spam."},{"post_categories":["International","Europe, Middle East and Africa"],"author":"Kevin Eyres","title":"Nächste Haltestelle: Deutsch","date":"February 4, 2009","content":"With increasing international travel and interaction, we know how critical communication is to commerce.

So, I thought it’s time for a follow-up to our CS lead, April's on these themes. Given below is a list of basic member security and privacy guidelines that will help keep you safe while you access your professional network on LinkedIn: 1. Let’s start with an easy one: Review your current LinkedIn . From there you can identify what information you’ve set that is private (only to your connections) and what is public. 2. Connect with only those you know and would trust because these are the people you will seek advice from and request a recommendation about your quality of work. 3. Keep your password secure & log out of your account when you are done (especially if you’re accessing your account from a public computer). 4. Always have at least one other email address assigned to your account should you lose access to the primary email address. 5. Finally, I’d recommend you ensure your computer’s security software is up to date.  And, most importantly, don’t click on a link you don’t trust. (If it feels suspicious...it probably is.) Let me also add that the above steps are not necessarily a guarantee but rather a starting point to keep your identity and data safe. If you find yourself struggling with additional questions on security and would like to reach the right person on LinkedIn, here are a few resources you can turn to: 1. Contact (scroll down to the bottom of the LinkedIn home page) to report any inappropriate or suspicious links found on profiles. 2. Check out LinkedIn’s where you can easily search and sort through numerous help topics on and . 3. And, don't forget to consult the for a current list of ‘LinkedIn User Do’s & Don’ts’.

Or should you seek out a lucrative contract with a promising corporation? Perhaps the answer is best determined by the professional temperament of an individual, but sometimes it's just a matter of the right opportunity at the right time. Web marketing consultant Jeff Torchon has done both - and with the help of LinkedIn, he found the transition surprisingly \"quick and easy\". Last year Jeff was happy running an independent consulting gig when two recruiters reached out to him via LinkedIn, offering director positions at major national firms. He interviewed with both, and one firm turned out to be one of his current clients. The proposition caused him to consider corporate life again. Around the same time, a couple of potential clients reached out to Jeff via InMail. Between two job offers and new client opportunities, Jeff had a great set of options to choose from. Considering the strong relationship, he decided to take the job with his existing client. Just recently, Jeff transitioned back into private consulting, and LinkedIn has helped smooth the change.

Here's a comprehensive list of 10 steps one should take on LinkedIn while job hunting: . Give yourself at least six months before your desired start date. Take time to review your goals and decide on a feasible plan of action. If your new career requires additional education, then begin even earlier. Take a look at job descriptions you’re interested in and make a checklist of the skills and talents they require. If you have weak spots you may want to consider taking a class at your local community college. If you don’t have time to attend a seminar or class (or if money is an issue) another option is to browse and/or ask questions on so you can get the info you need. Use to find questions associated with specific keywords like, “marketing” or “venture capital.” Read trade publications online and review the changes that are occurring in your industry. Staying on top of current trends and newsworthy events can often make or break an interview. Join that are associated with both your old/previous profession as well as the new industry that you’re looking to join. See what news articles people in those groups are reading by clicking on the news tab in the group and submit links to articles that you’ve read to start conversations/network with others in the group. Make sure that both your resume and profile reflect the changing times. Eliminate any terms that may have become obsolete. Use power keywords, words of action and words that show accomplishment and achievement - as opposed to words that merely describe what your previous role was. Also, if you’re currently unemployed list your current position as “open to opportunities.” . If you just recently lost your job, make sure you update your so your network know that you're looking for a job. It's a quick and easy way to let folks you're connected to know that you could use their help. , one of our users, updated his status upon being laid off. Within seven business days someone in his network knew of an open position, which . Sign on to LinkedIn and do a search for people that already have your dream job title. What positions did they hold beforehand? How long were they in their previous role? Information like this can be a valuable bargaining chip when it comes time to negotiate your salary. Also do search for your desired employer’s . Company Profiles show career paths for people before/after they joined a company, recent promotions/changes, most popular profiles and other stats that will help you understand any potential employer (and its competitors) better. Use LinkedIn to do a search for people that live in your hometown and work in your desired industry. Offer to take them to lunch near their office and learn more about the industry, their position, likes/dislikes and other firms in the area. New acquaintances help you expand your network giving you a broader reach into the job market. Use the networks of your friends and family since they are your best advocates. Before your interview, check and see if the person who’s interviewing you is on LinkedIn. If they are, check for common acquaintances. Having a mutual friend or old co-worker is a great icebreaker and an awesome way to get your foot in the door. It’s also worth taking a look at the schools they’ve attended and what cities they’ve lived in since that may be another commonality. And, never underestimate the power that your favorite pair of shoes or a good power suit can wield. A number of communities offer resources for people returning to the workforce. If you think you may be lacking marketable skills, haven’t been working for five years or more or have never held a paying job, check with your state’s department of labor office. The Internet also offers a plethora of blogs, columns and publications that are geared toward helping you jump start your career so do a search for those as well. And, finally, your LinkedIn profile is like a living, breathing resume; so ask friends and old co-workers to leave recommendations for you on your profile. That way potential employers can see them. Make sure that you ask references to comment on specific traits that highlight what a perfect fit you are for your new career and remember to thank them afterward. If you aren't looking for a job, but want to help a friend or colleague that lost their job leave a for them on their LinkedIn Profile. Recommendations spread virally, so if you leave Joe a recommendation on his profile all 65 of his connections will see a network update when they sign in showing that you just recommended his work. Your connections will also receive a network update saying that you just recommended Joe too so it's a fast and effective way to let both of your networks know that this person is a hard worker and great person to work with. * Feel free to share your favorite LinkedIn Tip on job hunting in the comments section"},{"post_categories":["Engineering"],"author":"Dan Kotler","title":"Live from Chicago! It’s LinkedIn’s new data center!","date":"December 17, 2008","content":"LinkedIn has grown by leaps and bounds this past year and currently we are adding professionals to our site at the rate of one user per second. Behind the scenes, there are several  dedicated teams of highly skilled people with (an unusually high tolerance for sleep deprivation), and a varied array of skills in areas such as capacity planning, network and server architecture, and web technology, and these teams are collectively known as the Linkedin Operations organization. All of these skills are continually focused on ensuring that the combination of hardware, software and data stored in our Data Center follows just the right ‘playbook’ to ensure that we offer you, a world class user experience. The primary goal for the LinkedIn Operations organization is for our site and partner applications to be available 24/7.

We recently launched a more streamlined design for LinkedIn Search, with the goal of helping our users, often on the run or at work, to find who they’re looking for both quickly and effectively. While Esteban’s post from last week focused on the product upgrades within LinkedIn search, I’d like to walk you through the process of designing an improved user experience for Search. Prior to launch, we conducted a rigorous research and design process in order to identify customer pain points and potential opportunities for improvement. We gathered feedback from a variety of sources and at different touch points, ranging from site feedback to analyzing site data to see what users were searching for on LinkedIn. Most importantly, we talked to different types of our users: both in individual think-aloud studies and in group forums, continually iterating based on their feedback. Given below are some of the key design improvements that resulted from those conversations: Our query analysis told us that our users were typically searching by name for someone they know. Therefore, we’ve simplified our default People Search view to make it easy to skim names and pictures and see key supporting information to confirm the right selection. The blue highlights on mouse-over group the information about a person and give quick access to the available actions. We know that there are times when you'd like to see more detailed information, so it’s now easy to switch to an expanded view, or even design a custom layout, directly from the top of the search results page. You can choose to see more, less, or different information for each result, and your view selection will be remembered the next time you visit. With over 32 million professionals to search through, we wanted to make it very convenient to narrow it down to the person(s) you’re looking for, or to edit your existing search without extra pages or clicks. We have surfaced the advanced search fields and sort options directly from the page and, like the results views, your sorts will be remembered next time you run a search. Other new efficiency tools, which you can learn about in , include type ahead short cuts to the profiles of your connections, spell check for names, saved searches, and saved search email updates. Last, but not least, we did hope to make the act of finding your peers and colleagues on LinkedIn more delightful, without compromising on functionality, simplicity, and ease of use. For example, we created a new field called “In Common”. Here we show each of the connections and groups you share with that person, in the hopes of further inspiring that “ah ha” moment, and helping each user better understand how connected we all are on LinkedIn. As part of the Interaction Design team, our goal is to address your needs and this is a first step in optimizing your search experience on LinkedIn. Please send us your feedback and suggestions so we can incorporate them into future design changes to the site!"},{"post_categories":["New LinkedIn Features"],"author":"Elliot Shmukler","title":"Now your LinkedIn profile speaks Español, Français, & 41 more languages","date":"November 19, 2008","content":"Since the of LinkedIn, we’ve had one consistent request from our multilingual users – how can I create a Spanish profile as well? After all, if you’re a professional in today’s global world, your network may extend well beyond the borders of your home country. And if a Spanish-speaking contact comes to view your profile via the Spanish version of LinkedIn, shouldn’t they be viewing your profile in Spanish as well? We, of course, thought this was a great idea. So today we’re rolled out the ability to translate your existing LinkedIn profile into any of 41 languages. Once translated, your original profile remains unchanged, but members that prefer to use or search LinkedIn in a different language will see the translated version instead. So if you create a Spanish profile via the steps below, LinkedIn members using the site in Spanish will see your Spanish profile instead of your English one. Here’s how to do it: Creating a translated version of your profile in a desired language is easy. Just click on the “Profile” link in the left hand side navigation and go to your “ ” page. On this page, click the “Create your profile in another language” link on the right hand side. After clicking the link above, you’ll be given the chance to kick-start the translation process by choosing the language into which you are translating and proving a translated first name, last name, and professional “headline”. Throughout the translation process we will show the content on your original (or as we call it, primary) profile to guide you in your work (it’s in blue below). Once you complete the initial translation step above, you will be brought to the “Edit My Profile” page for the language into which you are translating your profile. This page is just like the normal “Edit My Profile” page but is now editing the translated version of your profile in the language that you’ve chosen. Note that you can always return to this page (or find the “Edit My Profile” page for any language in which you’ve created a profile) by using the drop down in the upper right hand corner of the page. You’ll notice that to keep things simple, many of the elements of your profile are shared across all of your profile languages and versions. If you add a position, for example, it will appear on your profile for all languages. However, from the “Edit My Profile” page for the desired language, you can always click on any of the “Edit” links to adjust how that position, education or other piece of information appears in the language of your choice. On all such resulting edit pages, we will always show you content from your original/primary profile (in blue) to guide your adjustments & translation. These pages will also show you the full list of languages in which you have profiles (and where similar adjustments may be needed) on the right hand side of the page. As usual, throughout your editing/translating process, you can always review how others will see your profile by clicking on the “View My Profile” tab. We’ve added the profile language drop down to the right hand corner of this page as well, so that you can always review your profile in all the languages into which you’ve translated it. Starting today, LinkedIn members that use the site in Spanish will typically see the Spanish version of your profile on LinkedIn. And as LinkedIn continues to move into other languages & markets, the correct translation of your profile will be shown to members using or searching the site in those other languages. LinkedIn’s will also allow members to find profiles in a particular language. We’re still very early in adjusting LinkedIn for the needs of our multilingual and multinational professionals. So whether you find this feature useful or not, please let us know by leaving a comment on this post or clicking on the “Help Improve LinkedIn” link at the bottom of any page on the site."},{"post_categories":["Member Stories"],"author":"Rob Getzschman","title":"\"Cold calls are dead\" - Drew Neisser, Renegade","date":"November 21, 2008","content":"If advertising execs have been watching AMC's \"Mad Men\" with a knowing eye, it's likely because they say the show nails the period, the culture, and the industry.

Here is a video that summarizes some of the key features in the new search experience, followed by key elements of the new functionality: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_mAJ-Jg534&fmt=18] Our user’s profiles include a wealth of structured data that enables powerful search refinement options. You can refine search results by entering data in more than a dozen different fields that range from “name” and “company” to “school” and “language”. We eliminated the need to switch tabs if you want to see results with professionals from outside your network. The new search will retrieve the most relevant professionals from the entire LinkedIn community. One of the most important factors in ranking search results is the searcher’s network. This means that every matching search result is evaluated based on who is executing the search. The end result is a personalized relevance algorithm that places the professionals that are most likely to be of interest at the top of the first search results page. We synthesized over a thousand pieces of feedback and analyzed data from over a billion search queries. We leveraged the research to design powerful tools to help our users be more productive when looking for the right professional. Given below is a list of key functionality that the feature launches with today: •    “In Common” is a new field in search results that lets you find what connections and groups you share with the selected user. •    We’ll allow you to save searches and receive reminders by email if we find that someone new meets your search criteria. •    We now offer two views as part of the search results redesign: basic and expanded. In addition, we also let you customize your own view. You’ll be able to add or remove fields from search results based on what makes the most sense for your search. •    We know how hard typing people’s names is. We hear it from our users and also see it in the data. As a result, we built a robust spell checker for names. We’ll expand the spell checker to other type of keywords very soon. •    We also saw in the data that many of you use search to get to your connections quickly. In order to make it more efficient, we developed a type-ahead widget that recommends connections as you type from any people search box. These are some of feature enhancements you’ll see rolled out over the next few days. We hope this augments your productivity and we’d love to hear your feedback, questions and suggestions."},{"post_categories":["International","Europe, Middle East and Africa"],"author":"Jean-Luc Vaillant","title":"LinkedIn en Français is now a fait accompli!","date":"November 25, 2008","content":"We’re to introducing LinkedIn in more languages as part of our global development efforts and I’m very happy to announce that LinkedIn en Français is now a .  Whether you use it to online or have a , LinkedIn acts as a between 31M professionals worldwide and we're adding a new user every second.

As the largest global professional network, we’ve had the privilege of having millions of users enter over a billion professional search queries, and we’ve been working hard to build a much more robust professional people search engine.

Steve Kownacki, Producer/Director/Owner @ Final Focus Productions, writes: Service. Service. And oh, service. We have 2 main words in our mission statement \"value\" and \"passion\". Exemplify them in everything you do and everyone you communicate with. Treat each client as though they are your only client. You be honest about what you can deliver for a given budget. Just got back from lunch with a long-time client - they gave us 2 new jobs! - his comment: \"I come to you because I have no worries. I know it's in good hands.\" This is all I ever need to hear. But never take it for granted. Ronn Irving, Vice President, the TASCON Group, opines: Many business owners and their \"Trusted Advisors\" are going through the process of planning for the coming year. When they review their performance to date and forecast for changes in the coming year, it becomes clear they need to have a plan in place to generate more revenues to offset the skyrocketing costs of doing business. There are three ways to do that - 1. Control costs, both fixed and variable costs. 2. Increase sales - sell more widgets. 3.

It is how you present your professional background and identity to other LinkedIn members and it is what you look at first when you consider contacting or connecting with someone on LinkedIn. Well starting today, the Profile page will have a new look. All the information & tools you’ve come to expect are still there, but the page now has a cleaner look with subtle enhancements. Here’s what to look for: We’ve taken this opportunity to clean up the presentation of the page -- grouping related elements and tools, simplifying some editing prompts and tips, and making sure that the most important information stands out from everything else. The “blue card” you’ll see at the top of every profile page is one way of doing this – serving to highlight and organize the most important profile information. The Profile Completion meter is an ever-present indicator of the state of your profile throughout the site. Unfortunately, many of you have complained that it’s hard to know what to do to complete your profile and move that meter toward 100%. Today's meter does showcase a suggested next step in completing a profile -- but the suggested step may not always be an easy one. The newly improved Profile Completion meter, however,  shows the steps you can take to further improve the completion of your profile (and how much each step will move the completion meter). Hopefully, the additional options will help everyone on their way to 100% profile completeness. Each profile you view gives you a set of actions you can take in relation to that profile and the member to whom it belongs. You can contact the LinkedIn member in question via InMails and messages, leave a recommendation for one of your connections, or forward the profile. But, did you know that you can also print out a profile? Export a profile to a PDF file? Or as a premium account holder, quickly search for background references on any member whose profile you view? Many of you were not aware of these more advanced LinkedIn tools because they were not easy to find on the profile page. Well, once again, we’ve tried to fix all that -- with all the available tools now appearing in the upper right hand corner of any profile. -- We hope these changes improve your LinkedIn experience. But as with any significant change, there may be small issues to fix or adjustments that still need to be made.

Instead of stressing about immediate survival, professionals stress over deadlines, job security and the economy — not the kind of life-threatening moments stress can help resolve. As tells it, humans constantly turn on stress responses for the wrong reasons, and it's killing us. Sapolsky's National Geographic special, \" ,\" airs nationwide Wednesday night on PBS. The special explores what 30 years of baboon research have taught Robert about stress, and how humans have a knack for turning psychological dis-ease into physical disease. We had a rare chance to sit down with Robert and sought to apply his groundbreaking research to the common office primate. Ever wondered how important grooming is to putting stress in check? Find out: Beyond the four key tips Robert offers for reducing stress, he notes the importance of friends and grooming, which are \"much more predictive of health than your rank.\" This can be applied to the professional sphere and networking online. LinkedIn helps professionals of quality relationships which should accurately reflect their offline experience. As Robert says, \"Primates don't get a lot of solace from 2000 friends\" — build a reliable network of people you know and trust. Instead of literal \"grooming\", professionals need recognition and approval from peers to help reduce anxiety, depression, or neuroses. A simple virtual application of this need is met through , a service by which LinkedIn users can express approval of each others' work, which in turn enables them to feel good about their accomplishments and pursue greater opportunities. This week on , Robert asks, \"When it comes to balancing stress and professional achievement, how do you decide when 'enough is enough'?\" Follow the link to weigh in with your own solution to balancing stress or to find out how other successful professionals are doing just that.

This film has done well selling to an educational audience, offering a unique diversity to his young portfolio of indie film. \"In Search of a Midnight Kiss,\" meanwhile, has a very different business plan. \"US box office is a tiny piece of the pie compared to international rights and home video,\" said Seth, who has an MFA from the American Film Institute. \"The way that we're going to turn a profit is through international showings. We've already grossed half a million [dollars] in the UK box office. Our opening week in Greece we were the number 7 film in the nation. We sold every ticket for every screening for a week. We sold the theatrical rights in Spain, Scandinavia, Poland, Turkey, Israel.\" Not bad for a $25,000 film. Still, Seth and the small cast and crew of \"Midnight Kiss\" are hoping for good traction in US theaters. They'll have at least until November to catch the hearts of American movie watchers. Until then, Seth is seeking qualified answers about finding a sporting chance against the studios. And perhaps he's taking solace in that $500,000 UK gross.

Our weapon of choice is still Ruby on Rails, the popular MVC framework. Out belief is that Rails makes certain types of tasks easy, and others laughably trivial. That being said, LinkedIn is still primarily a Java shop, and for good reason. Java technologies are mature, proven, and all around solid. For this reason, LED has had a very vested interest in the development work that is going into JRuby. We started a few months ago around the time JRuby 1.1.2 went live by switching some of our Rails applications to run on Glassfish. Using , we successfully wrapped our Rails applications into WAR files and deployed on Glassfish (we’ll probably write a more detailed tutorial of this at a future date). A WAR file is completely self contained application that can be deployed simply by copying to an autodeploy directory. No more Apache/Nginx reverse proxy, no more Capistrano, no more installing gems on a production container, no more of any of that madness. This was a huge win, and we broke out the champagne bottles. But we weren’t done. We weren’t taking advantage of many Java technologies, most notably, we weren’t taking advantage of the JDBC connection pooling capabilities of the Glassfish application server for our MySQL database. We started by reading this tutorial by . The article is fantastic, but the one criticism I have is that it was written from the perspective of a master Java engineer that learned Rails, as opposed to that of a Rails engineer approaching JRuby. From a high level, here are the steps needed to enable JDBC connection pooling for a Rails application running in a Glassfish container: Believe it or not, there are only five steps. I have to admit, I was initially intimidated. Java allows so much power and flexibility that, to a novice, seeing a hundred configuration choices in the Glassfish admin web UI can be a deterrent. As it turns out, we only need to touch two parts of that UI. Let's get started: Log in to your Glassfish application server. Expand Resources->Connection Pools. Click new. You’ll be presented with three fields. The name is arbitrary, but you’ll need to know it later. Select javax.sql.DataSource as the resource type, and MySQL as the vendor. The next screen will have more options. Change the datasource classname to com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlConnectionPoolDataSource Under additional properties, there should be fields configuring the database connection. Set these as appropriate. JNDI stands for Java Naming and Directory Interface, and will allow us to create a standardized name for the JDBC connection pool we just created. In the navigation pane, click through to Resources -> JDBC -> JDBC Resources. Click new. In the drop down box, select the JDBC connection pool created in step 1. For the JNDI name, it’s accepted practice to name it jdbc/connection_name. tar zxvf mysql-connector-java-VERSION.tar.gz cd mysql-connector-java-VERSION ant cp mysql-connector-java-VERSION-bin.jar $GLASSFISH_HOME/lib You may have to restart Glassfish for the install to work: asadmin stop-domain DOMAIN asadmin start-domain DOMAIN In your config/database.yml file, we need to tell Rails to use the connection pool rather than directly connecting to the database. Here’s a snippet of our production configuration: That’s all you will need. Unlike standard configuration files, you do not need to specify things like the username, password or host because these are configured in the Application Server. I like this method because it means the engineer doing the deployment does not need to build the YAML file each time, check it in to SVN, or copy from a database.yml template with the production settings. It’s one less deployment step, and ultimately, one less item on the security checklist. ActiveRecord maintains a persistent connection to the database. This is no longer necessary, as there is very little overhead in opening a connection to JDBC, which manages the connection persistence. We’ll need to disable this. I’m using code borrowed from : You’re done! Now all you have to do is build the WAR file and drop it in Glassfish’s autodeploy directory."},{"post_categories":["Member Stories"],"author":"Rob Getzschman","title":"Building a company from scratch with LinkedIn recommendations – Sasha Strauss, Innovation Protocol","date":"August 6, 2008","content":"In our continuing series on LinkedIn users who find professional success with the site, we turn to downtown Los Angeles, where Sasha Strauss, Founder and Managing Director of Innovation Protocol, has built his business on referrals — most of which, he tells us, have come through LinkedIn.

OSCON) in Portland, Oregon. This was the 5th year I've attended (and spoke) at OSCON. I really like the diversity of open source projects and languages discussed at this conference. You can find always find good sessions on Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and even Java. Of the many sessions I attended, the ones I learned the most from were by Harry Heymann and Laurence Gonsalves and (PPT) by Steve Souders. If you didn't get a chance to attend OSCON this year, you might try watching by Gregg Pollack. This is a video where Gregg asks many speakers to summarize their talks in 30 seconds or less. On Wednesday, I presented my talk titled . I was inspired to do this talk when I first heard of (Service Oriented Front End Architecture) and (Service Oriented UI) last fall. These acronyms suggest the same type of architecture; one where the backend serves up data (via SOAP, REST, etc.) and the frontend handles page flow, navigation, etc. SOFEA was created by Ganesh Prasad, Rajat Taneja and Vikrant Todankar in their \"Life Above the Service Tier\" paper, while SOUI was created by Nolan Wright and Jeff Haynie in a couple of blog posts. To do research for this talk, I created two different versions of the same application. One was with Flex and Rails and the other was with GWT and Grails. While I didn't complete the application before the talk, I do plan on continuing to work on it in my spare time and will hopefully have something to show later this fall. The application I'm creating is called \"Rich Resume\" and will allow you to edit and publish your resume online quickly and easily. If everything goes well, I'll add the ability to import your LinkedIn Profile to get started. As far as my progress on the application, I was able to finish both backends with Grails and Rails in under 25 hours. Both framework's out-of-the-box dynamic scaffolding didn't support one-to-many relationships very well, so I did have to tweak some things. With Rails, I was able to use to solve my issues. With Grails, I had to generate Controllers and then manually tweak them to add one-to-many and REST support. As far as Flex and GWT, I found them both easy to get started with. I got bit early by GWT's , which made it difficult to develop the frontend and backend on different hosts. After moving the GWT app into Grails (using the ), things went much smoother. I was disappointed to find that GWT doesn't support REST too well, but there seems to be many folks that share this same sentiment and quite a few solutions are being developed (for example, ). While Flex allows for cross-domain communication, I was disappointed to find it doesn't support zero turnaround (save/refresh) outside of an IDE. I'm sure over the coming months, I'll develop a greater sense of affection for these frameworks, but I also think it's important to note first impressions. Below is my presentation for your viewing pleasure. In October, I'll be a similar talk at the . This time, I'll be using to build my Rich Resume application. It should be a good show, especially since my colleagues and will be speaking.

Gears is an open source project that enables more powerful web applications, and provides for a better user experience with a cross-browser plugin. Gears gets installed on a user's machine (the same way any other plugin like Adobe Acrobat Reader does), and then provides a local database, worker pool, and a local web server. The database is a full-featured SQLite DB which provides SQL queries, views, triggers, full text search, and the ability to store gigs of user data locally. The local server can allow you to run web apps offline by storing HTML, CSS, images, etc., but in managed, versioned bundles which can be downloaded in the background, and it does not get cleared when the user clears the browser's cache. Using it is much better than relying on the normal browser cache. The worker pool gives you the ability to send tasks for background processing off to Gears, so that JavaScript code can be run asynchronously without blocking the main script running in the browser. This is perfect for dealing with any number crunching, long DB queries, or communication with remote servers. Google has more information in their . Afterwards, Brad stayed around to discuss how different engineering groups at could use Gears to give our users a better user experience and more powerful features.

First, it’s important to note that a business' brand is much more than just a logo and a tag line – it’s a promise of value, a promise made and delivered by the employees of that company. Historically, that promise was communicated to customers through advertising, packaging, PR, promotions, merchandising and in-store experiences, and the only contact with the company's employees came from salespeople, customer service agents and communications managers.  The rest of the company’s employees where rarely exposed to customers. That’s pretty crazy when you think about it: people don’t just buy from a company.  They buy from the people at a company. They buy from the people who create the products, the people who design the features, the people who make everything work, and it helps to see the experience levels, expertise, and skills of the people who provide and develop a company's products and services. Yet it’s been relatively hard for customers to learn about the people who work at a potential supplier. That’s all changing, and for the better. LinkedIn makes it easy for a potential customer to learn about who works at your company, which will very likely impact their purchase decisions. Let’s say a customer was considering an enterprise software purchase and had narrowed their selection down to two potential vendors. Using LinkedIn’s People Search and Company Profiles, the potential customer could learn a lot about the people who work at each company: What experience do these people have? Who recommends them? Who are they connected to. What insights have they shared in Answers and what kind of expertise have they earned? The answers to those questions – in addition to the strength of the company’s product and its brand reputation – can greatly affect the purchase outcome. If you’re reading this, chances are you have a LinkedIn profile. If your company needs customers to be successful, then everyone else in your company should have a LinkedIn profile too. Your product people should have profiles, your technicians should have profiles, your CEO should have a profile. You may even want to ask your marketing department for advice on how best to describe your company in your LinkedIn profile, as well as what is that you do to ensure there’s a consistent message about the promise of value that you, your company and your colleagues are making to existing and potential customers.

Below are my notes from his talk. In September 2007, Google started thinking about Social APIs. Google Gadgets would be better with access to Social Data ... but that's just Google. It was recognized that this is something that many others would like access to. OpenSocial was in November 2007. It's an open standard for developer platforms that has a strong emphasis on \"social\" data. It's based on gadgets which is now covered by . In November, many Googlers started working on a Google Code project based on Java and iGoogle. However, there was too much proprietary code. In December, Brian McCallister of Ning created an ASF Proposal for Shindig. It was a rough port of iGoogle but with Ning's PHP code. This turned out to be a great starting point. It immediately got interest from Google, Hi5, MySpace and others. While most committers are still from Google, there are 12 developers that work on it full time and they're adding 2 committers each month. Shindig is a Java/PHP implementation of OpenSocial. is an Apache-licensed .NET implementation that hopes to eventually merge into Shindig. Shindig has extensive use of existing open source components, including Abdera, Jakarta Commons, Guice, ICU4J, OAuth.net, and JSON.org. It's largely well tested (developers use TDD), especially for the newer code. There's a heavy emphasis on DI (Guice helps tremendously) and the builds are done with Maven (Apache recommendation, Kevin hates it). 3 Parts of Shindig: For security, iframes cover most of the problems. Cross-domain communication requires special effort - has to be implemented using a variety of techniques: in HTML5, in Firefox and in IE (still in development). Retrieving third-party data is covered by OAuth and Signed Fetch. Getting OAuth / Signed Fetch credentials can be done by passing an encrypted blog of data to the server and treating it as a cookie equivalent. is the future. (pronounced ka-ha) makes it possible to run third-party JavaScript alongside existing code. It's not quite ready yet, but significant process has been made. It has limited support in Shindig today, which requires \"taming\" JavaScript APIs and DOM testing. Full support for 0.6-0.8 gadget rendering specification (both versions). Full support for 0.6-0.8 JavaScript APIs. REST mostly done (both versions, PHP is closer). Deployed (or in progress) on many sites: Orkut, hi5, iGoogle sandbox, Hyves, CyWorld, Ning and hundreds of others. It has a very active mailing list and they're very interested in finding folks with more Maven experience to help out. The project's next priority is a stable release. Shindig 1.0 will be OpenSocial 0.8 Compliant. It must have full support for REST. The Java and PHP implementations should be released around the same time. Priority #2 is graduating from Apache Incubator (goals are currently on target). One of the main things they need is more committers, especially those that aren't from Google.

You define a fragment bundle by adding a special header in the MANIFEST: This is what it looks like in the Equinox console: 55 is a fragment bundle and it attaches to its host 39. The header is defined like this: Note that you can have more than one fragment attached to a host (but you cannot have a fragment attached to multiple hosts). Once a fragment is attached to its host, it behaves like if it was part of it. Conceptually, the behavior is similar to what you would obtain if you were to unjar the host and the fragment, and recreate a unique bundle made up of the content of the 2 separate bundles (including manifest headers). It allows to attach behavior and resources to a bundle. For example if you use the method before attaching the fragment then you will see only the content of the directory in the host bundle. If you call the same method after the fragment has been attached you will get a different result with the content of the directory in the host and fragment! This is pretty powerful to load any kind of resources (for example, a localized properties file, etc.). Here is another example using the fact that the host has now access to classes it didn't know about before: class. The system property gets set on the command line and if the fragment is attached, using reflection, the Log4j factory will be instantiated properly although the host does not depend on Log4j nor knows anything about . If it is not attached I simply use the JDK logger. The lifecycle of fragments is a little bit different from other bundles. For example you cannot start a fragment. If you undeploy a fragment that is attached to a host, the fragment is gone from the list of bundles but it is still attached to the host. Same if you install a new one. You actually need to 'refresh' the host to see something happening. Below is an example of activating a bundle with Equinox: Now that you know what a fragment is, it should be easy to understand how to extend Spring-DM: you simply need to attach a fragment to the host bundle called . In your fragment you need to have a directory called which contains normal Spring context files. Spring-DM will automatically see those files, create an application context and instantiate the beans. It will then look for beans with some specific names to customize itself: this is described in the . For example, by having a bean called , you can extend or override entirely the way Spring-DM detects that a bundle is a Spring Powered Bundle. By default, Spring-DM looks for a header or the presence of a directory to determine that it is a Spring Powered Bundle. You can redefine this behavior to be your own custom header or your own custom directory (or whatever other mechanism you can think of). You can also provide configuration properties like how long to wait on shutdown. Note: As mentioned in the fragment lifecycle section above, be careful if you attach/update the fragment. You need to refresh the host which in the case of Spring-DM extender will shutdown all application contexts created previously and recreate them. My recommendation is to install both the fragment and the host, and start the host only once they are both installed so that the fragment attaches right away without having to refresh the host afterwards."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Life"],"author":"Arvind Rajan","title":"Working at LinkedIn!","date":"July 11, 2008","content":"This is my first post on the LinkedIn Blog that I write less than a month since I started here as Vice President of People Operations.

In other words we essentially use the IoC container. To give you an idea of how extensive we use it, as of this writing, we have over 1000 Spring files that make up the LinkedIn platform! Before Spring 2.0, there was no easy way to extend the framework itself to add your own custom XML tags. One might wonder why you would want to do this? Well I guess the best answer lies in the fact that it was introduced with Spring 2.0 :-). More seriously, the idea of having your own custom tags can be compared to the ability of creating a JSP tag library for JSPs: you can create tags that are more specific to your domain, define required attributes so that it can actually be validated with an XML schema (instead of properties), etc. Example without custom tags: With custom tags (achieving the same result): The explains in details how to create your own. After you've created custom tags, your JAR file will look something like the following: Writing the code that handles the new tag is pretty low level and requires you to understand how Spring actually works under the covers. If I had one wish, it would be the ability to write the extension without having to write code (basically defining the extension as a normal Spring XML file!). (or Spring DM) is the integration of Spring and . It is very interesting because it allows you to stay in land and be able to look for references/deploy services in an OSGi container without ever writing any OSGi specific code. For example you don't need to write a , Spring DM does the plumbing for you. Spring DM is extending the Spring framework using the namespace extension described previously, to offer a new set of custom tags to wire the services together ( and ). Example: So now here is an interesting question: how do you make your own custom tags available with Spring-DM? In regular (non OSGi) Spring, whenever a namespace is defined in the (rather verbose) XML declaration, Spring uses the classpath to locate the entry point to the code that needs to be executed for the namespace you define ( ). In , I mentioned that in OSGi the concept of classpath is nonsensical, so clearly this mechanism does not work anymore. Spring DM actually uses a famous OSGi pattern: . Roughly speaking, it comes down to implementing a listener on the OSGi framework bundle events like \"bundle resolved\" or \"bundle unresolved\". Whenever Spring DM a resolved bundle which contains the correct file ( ), it adds the namespace to the list of known namespaces (and remove it when the bundle is removed). This is a very good demonstration of how dynamic OSGi is: it is very easy to add and remove features to a running OSGi container. As a side note, \"remove\" is a concept that is often overlooked as it can even be experienced in the JDK itself! For example, there is a way to add new protocol handlers for URLs with the method . Not only this method can be called only once per JVM (as stated in the javadoc), but where is the unset method? Thankfully, the OSGi spec defines a way to add and remove dynamically new stream handlers. Below is a code example for the extender pattern: Note that in the listener, you have access to the Bundle itself ( ), so the extender pattern can be based on whatever you want which is accessible through this interface. For example it could be based on proprietary manifest headers that are accessible through . The answer to the original question (about how do you make your own custom tags available with Spring-DM) is now very simple. If you have a JAR file already containing your custom namespace, it is now just a matter of turning the JAR file into an OSGi bundle. Spring-DM will automatically detect it! I have been using Spring DM 1.1.0-m2 for my testing and it works perfectly. Nonetheless be aware of an issue: there is a race condition which is not properly handled in this release (it is unclear to me whether it will be addressed in a future release). The scenario is the following: It is a race condition because it depends on the order and timing in which bundles gets resolved. It can be pretty tricky to enforce an ordering and I believe it would be better if Spring DM would handle this case gracefully. If an unknown namespace is encountered, it should wait for some amount of time for the namespace to be (asynchronously) registered. If the namespace does not get registered within the amount of time, then it should fail. Spring DM is already doing something similar when wiring services which may not be present in the OSGi registry at wiring time. Stay tuned for part 2: I will be talking about how to extend the Spring DM application context using fragments."},{"post_categories":["Engineering"],"author":"Jim Meyer","title":"Web Scalability Practices: Bumper Sticker on Rails","date":"June 23, 2008","content":"This is the first post in a series on scalability using Ruby on Rails including an examination of the steps we took – some successful, some not so much – to scale Bumper Sticker to be one of the top four applications on Facebook. This time out, we’re going to give you a quick history of the Light Engineering Development (LED) team at LinkedIn and the creation of Bumper Sticker. One of the best things about working for LinkedIn is the constant exposure to new technologies and challenges. While the majority of the LinkedIn infrastructure runs on Java, it’s no secret that we don’t shy away from other interesting languages and frameworks – we’re always looking for ways to make better software faster. This is the spirit that launched the LED group with the charter to see how quickly it could prototype new ideas and features using Ruby on Rails. Interestingly enough, the most successful of LED’s Rails applications is one of its first – Bumper Sticker, the fun, viral media sharing application that allows users to express their individuality by sticking small, quirky, sometimes edgy, often humorous, rarely serious virtual stickers on each other’s (and their own) Facebook profiles. Bumper Sticker started as a small experiment in August, 2007. Facebook had released their development platform while we were hard at work on our own. We were curious to experiment and discover some of the characteristics of an application platform built on a social network and to see what, if any, learning we could apply to our own efforts. After noticing that professional and business-related applications weren’t flourishing in the Facebook ecosystem, a few of   put their heads together while out for a run; , one week, and a few accelerators later, Bumper Sticker was born.

I guess the first question I need to answer is why on earth does LinkedIn has its own JSP compiler? The answer is partly for historical reasons and partly for feature reasons. The JSP compiler that we have (I am the author of it) has the in the following manner: The second question that comes to mind, is why is it challenging to have the JSP compiler running within OSGi? To answer this question there are 2 things to understand: This is where there is a strong disconnect: step 3 needs to compile Java source code into byte code. If you are familiar with the standard Java compiler provided with the JDK (javac), you know that what you need to provide for the compilation is a classpath (with a lot of limitations of what the classpath can really be (it cannot be any arbitrary urls, etc.)). For efficiency reasons, every time we invoke the Java compiler, we do not want to fork a new external process to invoke javac. Unfortunately with Java 5 there is no way of doing this. There is a non supported way of doing it, which is what we use: Java 6 offers a standard way of invoking the compiler from within Java itself by using the functionalities. I was very excited when I saw this especially the fact that there is a method. Since OSGi has the concept of which offers an API very similar to a , it is fairly easy to write an adapter: Unfortunately my excitement got shattered when I realized that the ClassLoader was not used during the compilation, but only, as stated in the JavaDoc \"for loading plug-ins (ex: annotation processors) from the given location\". I really thought for a minute that you could use the Classloader instead of the classpath. It would have been too nice. The only method that looked potentially promising was: This method gets called for every single package that is declared in the source code and is expecting in return a list of all the classes that the package contains. Unfortunately, it is impossible to get this from a Bundle. There may be convoluted ways to get to it using the but it was starting to get very hairy and seemed like a lot of work. I then switched my focus away from the JDK as I was not getting anywhere and decided to explore the (org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.Compiler). After all, Eclipse is built on top of OSGi so there had to be a way to compile Java code with the compiler. Thankfully I found the source code for Jasper, the Apache implementation of the standard JSP compiler and this is exactly what is being used. If you look at the class, you can see a very good example of how to use the Eclipse compiler (and trust me you need an example... as it is over 300 lines of code to invoke the compiler!). Using this example, I was able to implement the compilation and get everything working. The big advantage of this solution is that, unlike javac which expects the content of a package, you only need to locate a class which is totally possible with a ClassLoader. Below is my INameEnvironment implementation: It took me about a full day to investigate the Java 6 approach (which did not conclude successfully) and I had the code up and running using the Eclipse compiler in about 4 hours. To conclude, I would just like to say that I am happy to see that the JDK is finally offering a standard way of invoking the Java compiler from within Java code. However, it feels like there is more work to do. They need to offer the ability to not use the concept of classpath anymore, but instead use a ClassLoader. Also it'd be great if the concept of classpath was expanded to support the concept of URL instead of restricting the classpath to be a bunch of jar files or classes located on the file system. I hope you enjoy this post and stay tuned for more posts on OSGi at LinkedIn.

I wanted to take a moment to follow-up with a second post on the conference, specifically about the that I participated in Tuesday afternoon. The other panelists included: It's normally hard to have a great panel late in the afternoon - people are starting to wear down from waking up early, and sitting a few hundred people in a dark room is not a great way to generate high energy.  This panel, however, was extremely high energy (we even tried to get a Web 2.0 buzzword bingo game going) and ready to engage passionately on the topic. The balance of the panel was good too - Kevin represented 3rd party application developers well, David & Chris did a great job advocating for open, user-controlled integration, and Dave & I representing the platforms. I won't try to cover all the questions or topics from the panel, but there were two points that I made at the panel that I think are worth sharing broadly: It's quickly forgotten, but it wasn't too long ago that the question of how to present the best 10 search results to a natural search query was a hotly contested product space. When Google, Yahoo, or Microsoft get a query of just a few keywords, they have to decide in an instant which 10 pages out of millions to show you.  Similarly, Amazon has to decide, out of millions of products, which 3 to merchandise to you at any given time. The question of how to filter and present information and micro-events from your network to you in a digestible form is an extremely difficult and important question, and one of the most exciting things going on right now is the experimentation with different approaches to providing the right events to people at the right time in the right context. What makes this challenge particularly difficult is that unlike search or merchandising, it's unclear in this  context what the right  \"success\" events are to measure.  With search, it's clicks.  With e-commerce, it's purchases.   What should we measure with feeds, where sometimes the value is received just by reading the message?  Is it a click?  A hover?  A rating?  Dave Morin talked about optimizing for user engagement, but I think we're all still experimenting with the best ways to measure success for feeds. At LinkedIn, we place an extreme emphasis on in every application we develop. Nowhere is this more important than in Network Updates, where people count on getting useful updates on activity in their professional network.  As the number of activities and users on LinkedIn grows, we continue to investigate and experiment with ways to optimize the feeds we provide our users.  We have some of our best product, design and engineering talents on this exact problem. With those two points made, I just want to say thank you to and the rest of the panelists for the great event. I'm looking forward to the next one already."},{"post_categories":["Engineering"],"author":"Yan Pujante","title":"OSGi at LinkedIn","date":"June 10, 2008","content":"For about 2 months now, LinkedIn has been actively working on a new iteration of its architecture: one that scales both from a customer point of view, and from a developer point of view. Our desire for modularity, decoupling, and service discovery led LinkedIn to look at for its new platform/container. Currently we're using for our frontend and for our backend. OSGi has the right properties that we believe will help us achieve our goal. Probably one of the most known pieces of software that uses OSGi is , the most popular open source IDE for Java (yes, it's a lot more than that, but this is what it's famous for). OSGi is a specification and is an open source implementation of the specification on top of which Eclipse is built. There are other implementations of OSGi, like and . I went to the EclipseCon 2008 conference a couple of months ago to follow the OSGi track. The good news is that OSGi as a server container is getting a lot of traction as more and more people are embracing the new technology and seeing the advantages of what it can bring (multiple versions of the same class in the same container, dynamic updates of classes, etc.). Moving to OSGi is not a trivial task as the programming concepts differ quite a bit from the more standard Java development lifecycle we are used to. Furthermore, the tooling is currently in its infancy. At LinkedIn, we have a pretty big code base, so it makes the migration all the more challenging. In this series of posts on , we are going to share our experience with OSGi, our pain points as well as our progress and successes. In the process, we will share some of the internals of how LinkedIn is currently built.

I'm happy to do the gig no one wants. I'll suck it up and get the job done. So in early May I booked a ticket for Nice and headed to the Cannes Film Festival. As the Entertainment Market Manager, my mission at Cannes was to find out how filmmakers were using LinkedIn. Certainly I discovered much about how a bewildered American navigates Southern France without a cell phone or a single Euro. But I also found out the truth about Cannes — the terrible secret don’t want you to know. Watch the video for more. LinkedIn sponsored The American Pavilion, a place where yankees can meet and network amidst the fury of the festival. The member badges proudly announced, \"I'm LinkedIn at The American Pavilion\". There's nothing like a badge to make you feel like an insider. Vis à vis: LinkedIn is quickly becoming a required utility for the entertainment industry. Studios, agencies, record labels and guilds are all discovering the incredible utility of visualizing your network and making connections you didn’t know you had. For a volatile industry, it helps to know where your people are. Cannes is swarmed with filmmakers, producers and distributors all looking for business. Check out the video for some first-person accounts of how LinkedIn proves invaluable — and here are some more practical tips I found useful. Many folks get a temporary phone while they’re in Cannes, which gives them a new phone number every year they’re there. Some have taken to posting their temporary numbers in their status fields – that way anyone over in Cannes can look them up on LinkedIn and get their +33 number. Those that don’t get a French phone can quietly promote the properties they’re shopping at Cannes, like Chatsby Films President , who posted, “Adam is in Cannes doing business for ‘Seasons In The Valley’ and ‘Death on Demand’.” No one in the film business wants to field calls from unknown entities. Validate your career efforts by placing your custom URL ( , ) in your email signature. This enables people to click through and quickly see where you’ve been, what you’re up to now, and why they might take a meeting with you. It’s not unusual to make more LA connections in Cannes than you might living in LA. But Cannes is a busy place, and trying to meet up with new people can be hit or miss. Uploading a photo will enable new connections to know the face they’re looking for in a crowd of strangers. And for reconnecting with old colleagues and classmates, nothing beats a familiar face. As LinkedIn represents your professional brand online, use the three outgoing hyperlinks to send people right to your movie, music, or filmography online. Got your projects on iTunes? Netflix? Amazon? IMDb? YouTube? Link to these and enable people to review your creative efforts first-hand. -- Keep checking the LinkedIn Blog to find out how other industries are using the site to open the right doors and develop opportunities for their companies and careers. I'll be here doing the dirty work for LinkedIn, leaving no stone unturned to get the story. Special thanks to Marcio and for use of their song \"Nova\"!

We started with an extremely small team of engineers (2-3) and eventually grew to 6 engineers. We needed a framework that could give us the productivity we needed, while allowing us to leverage the extensive assets we have invested in our backend logic built on top of Java and Spring. Given that most of us are Java engineers, we wanted something that had a shorter learning curve. I'd been playing with since 0.1 days, and I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to test drive this technology. I wanted to see if we could quickly realize the productivity gains in a real world scenario. My main worries were: scalability and compatibility with the . Due to the fact that this is not a free product, our initial customer base has been small and will remain small for a quite some time. Because of this, we were able to de-prioritize the usual stringent scalability requirement to allow us to give this young framework a chance to prove itself. Another engineer (who had no prior experience with Grails) and I built two initial prototypes: one based on (Spring MVC/JSP + Hibernate), and one based on . We found that Grails was a lot faster to work with, even in its immature state. We then took a month to firm up the prototype and presented to management to gain their blessings to do it for real. Below is a presentation that my colleagues , , and I put together for a JavaOne . This presentation tells about our experience using Grails to build our application. This is the first in a series of blog posts we'll be writing.

Not only did I attend some sessions covering Google technologies, but I also spoke to the developer community about LinkedIn's integration. For the inaugural year of the conference I thought Google did a good job organizing and structuring the sessions around high-level areas such as Social, Mobile, AJAX, etc. I'm a big believer in learning by doing so it was great to see the speakers incorporate example code and live demos. One of the sessions I found most interesting was about , a dependency injection framework. It takes advantage of annotations in Java 5 to do away with all the hairy XML files those of us who use Spring are familiar with. During my talk, I explained how LinkedIn's OpenSocial integration is being built around , an open source implementation of the and . Shindig uses Google Guice for dependency injection, so attending this session was an opportunity to learn more about how Shindig is put together and whether Guice is a technology worth using in other parts of the LinkedIn architecture. To summarize my talk (without all the marketing fluff), our philosophy at LinkedIn is a bit different when it comes to OpenSocial and social networking in general. We serve a community of professionals who want productivity apps and tools to assist in their professional lives. This is quite a bit different from other containers where entertainment and socializing are the focus of most third-party apps. Our OpenSocial Platform is built on Shindig (currently spec level 0.7) and it leverages existing LinkedIn RESTful APIs as well as supports RESTful server-to-server calls. We will have a sandbox available to partners this quarter and hope to publicly launch it next quarter. It doesn't look like Google has posted a video of the talk yet. In the meantime, you can checkout my slides (31-35) below.

This week's question shines the spotlight on continued national interest in personal real estate as evidenced by this NYT article titled \" \".  The question from , Supply Quality Engineer at Boeing, even surprised him in terms of the quality and number of answers that he offered to consolidate the answers into a nice spreadsheet for those interested. Even better, , another LinkedIn user spent an entire hour on Saturday explaining to Joel his analysis for investing in real estate. Joel says: Thanks to Doug Boedecker!!! Doug spent about an hour on Saturday explaining his detailed analysis methodology for investing in real estate in select neighborhoods in the Mid West and Southern states. I believe he has some very profitable ideas and I highly recommend him to everyone of my contacts that are interested in investing in real estate in the future. Besides Doug's answer, here was the best answer selected by Joel from , Realtor/Investor in ZipRealty. I'm going to publish the answer in its entirety for the benefit of the readers, long as it may be. Consider yourself warned. Without a doubt, the most important question to ask is “why am I investing.” Investing strategies may sometimes be diametrically opposed based on the desired outcome of the strategy. For instance, if an investor seeks to build a portfolio of monthly income producing properties, he may consider buying homes in impoverished areas where a greater number of people rent. If he wants to flip homes, this would not be the best strategy. Again, location is a very important part of strategy. When one buys a personal residence, he may select a property in an older, established neighborhood. While this may be an excellent decision for a personal residence, investors tend to gravitate toward neighborhoods on the upswing of their lifecycles. Also, rental returns are often higher in areas the investor would not personally choose to live. Typically investors should focus on one or two neighborhoods if possible. This way, the investor will be aware of the intimate details of the area, and he will know exactly what homes sell for, and, more importantly, what he should pay. Very few residential property investors would be successful if traditional bank financing were the only method by which an investor could acquire properties. Bank financing is certainly an important part, but unconventional methods such as lease purchasing, wrap around mortgages, sandwich leasing, and purchase options are all important strategies when acquiring investment properties. An investor should spend considerable time determining by which means he will acquire desirable properties, and what resources and capital he has available prior to locating properties. Very few investors will spend their entire career flying solo. At some point, most investors partner on deals. Investors should always make a list of people who would invest with them if an offer was presented that both parties feel could be mutually lucrative. Nothing is more frustrating than finding that “home-run” property, and not having the resources to acquire it. Also, many people are involved in your investment property. They all need to make money. If they make money they will be happy to help you make money. The most important of these people is your contractor. Many novice investors try to cut almost all the profit from the contractor to maximize their own profit on a single investment property. This strategy will eventually spell doom. Everyone needs to make money. I’m not saying that an investor should pay whatever the contractor asks, but be fair and share the wealth. The investor has most all the risk, so he should get the lion’s share, but he needs good contractors who also need to make a living. Some investors buy a wide variety of homes, but most investors pick a style, price range, or home type to specialize in. If someone specializes in period craftsman homes, he will become very familiar with his typical buyer, and he will quickly develop a repertoire of contractors who specialize in these types of homes. I cannot emphasis strongly enough how important it is to have good relationships with several contractors. Every neighborhood goes through a life cycle. At what point of the life cycle an investor buys is high dependent on the investment strategy. Unless the investor is a seasoned, it is best to consult a professional for information on neighborhood life cycles. This information will prove invaluable to the investor."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn API"],"author":"Taylor Singletary","title":"Announcing the Company Insider Widget","date":"May 16, 2008","content":"I'm happy to announce the availability of LinkedIn's , the first in a coming your way this year.

Here's a quick rundown that will help you navigate this nifty LinkedIn feature: You'll notice that LinkedIn's \"People you may know\" is the first module that you'll find on the top right hand pane of your redesigned LinkedIn homepage showcasing three relevant recommendations of people you may know. The best part of the feature is that you can avoid seeing the same recommendations each time you log into LinkedIn, by identifying the recommendation as one of the following: a. I don't know them b. I don't know them well enough c. Prefer not to connect d. Other reason If you'd like to check out additional recommendations, click on the \" .\" This will lead you to a landing page with more results listed (if there are additional ones for you).

But Apec doesn’t just list job postings. They want to help you find a job and build your career in every way they can. So, they have offices throughout France to help you in person. And now, they are deeply integrating professional networking into the job search process and beyond though this integration with LinkedIn. Earlier this month, some of you may have read that described our collaboration with Apec. Here's a quick video demo of how that collaboration plays out in terms of LinkedIn functionality on the Apec site. Apec’s integration is very deep. They both help you build and use your LinkedIn network right on their site. So, as you look for a job, you are building a healthy professional network, which helps you long term. You’ll notice that you can see who you know at hiring companies, in industries, and in countries in which you might want to work.  You can also search LinkedIn directly within Apec, helping you find hiring managers and helping hiring managers find you.  They also pipe in your network updates just to make sure you stay close to your LinkedIn network while you are on the Apec site. This has been a win-win for both Apec as well as for us. While Apec is one of the largest job boards in France, LinkedIn continues growing the world's largest online group of professionals, with close to 21 million professionals as of today. Moreover, in a global economy when the world is getting flatter with each passing day, even looking for a job down the street requires access to a global network of business professionals to help you.

Now you can. Go to Business Week. Read an article. In the Story Tools area, you’ll see a link to see your LinkedIn connections at the company mentioned in the article. Business Week has implemented the first LinkedIn widget to show you connections at a company mentioned on the page. It’s a simple Javascript widget that integrates your LinkedIn network with the content of the business article you are reading. This is definitely the start of many more such integrations across the web that'll enable you to leverage the strength of your LinkedIn network. Want to see how it works? Check out a video demo below. Last time you looked for a job, did you ever want to know whether anyone could help you get in the door for an interview? Now you can do that on SimplyHired site, via a LinkedIn API integration. Look at a job posting and click the IN icon to see who you know at the hiring company. Then, simply reach out to them or a common connection and ask for help in getting the job. Check out a quick demo below where I walk through a similar scenario. You’ll notice that this looks different from the Business Week integration. Simply Hired used the LinkedIn APIs to build the interface with specific names of people.

All in a day's work! And here's what the page looks like now, with all the bricks in place: Most of the information we've surfaced in this beta iteration of Company Profiles is unique data you'd find valuable for anyone interested in researching, working with or working for a company.

As you can see, we had a fun shoot yesterday where I give an overview of Company Profiles. For those of you who don't have time to go through the 3 minute demo below (and I can't fault you on that), here's a quick summary: Starting now, you'll be able to see over 160,000 profiles of companies on LinkedIn, ranging from Fortune 500 companies (e.g. ) to philanthropic organizations (e.g. ) as well as .  Company Profiles on LinkedIn is a succinct overview of a company's industry data in combination with LinkedIn data along certain key metrics. The easiest way to access any company profile is stumbling upon it through individual profiles themselves. As you're browsing any profile, look out for a logo right next to company titles, in any individual's work history. Clicking through the highlighted company links will take you to the Company Profile directly. So, keeping in mind the unwritten \"rule of the LinkedIn blog\", which is insert an Adam Nash reference at every given opportunity in the blog. So, let's start with . Clicking on the company name (in this case, eBay, Inc.) will take you to the Company Profile page, which you can find . An alternative to navigating company profiles is also the Search box that you can find once you are on any company's profile page. Please remember, this is still in beta and we'll be adding easier ways for you to access this information in the following weeks. Once you're on a company page you'll notice two sets of modules, the set of modules on the left is about about relevant people information and on the right you can see some key company stats modules. Given below are more details.  The modules you see on the left pane of the Company profile are about professionals within the organization, highlighted and sorted by relevance and distance from You, in four key categories. The first module in this space shows you the people in your network who work at that company. As with all LinkedIn results, these are sorted by the number of degrees they are away from you within the LinkedIn ecosystem. In many companies, especially fast growing companies such as ourselves (at LinkedIn), it's always great to find out who're the most recent hires and this module answers that question.  Another question that I'd love to find an answer for are who're the movers and shakers within my organization. This could be particularly helpful for large Fortune 500 companies and since the results are sorted by how close they are to you, the chances are you'll always stumble upon peers you know well. The last module on the left pane, shows those individuals who're in the News recently. As you can see the eBay examples show the President, two Senior Vice Presidents and Chief Marketing Officer among others. To the right of the relevance modules, you'll be able to find two key information modules on the company, which are described below. * Related companies The first of the two company modules, surfaces relevant information about the career trajectory of the company's employees. Not only does it show the companies they come from and go to, but also connectivity among professionals working at different companies. The information you find in the key stats module is aggregated from non-personally identifiable data of LinkedIn users who are currently employed by this company. There are two modules within Key Stats that we surface. One is basic data on Industry, Type, Status, etc..., which we get from our partner Business Week while the second module has unique information culled from LinkedIn that hasn't been available before. They range from Common Job Title, Top Schools to Median Age and Tenure within the company. * TechCrunch | * CNET News | -- Have fun perusing profiles of companies from the mainstream to the Long Tail of corporate America's ecosystem and stay tuned for updates as we make this more relevant for each LinkedIn user.

There are two important advancements in LinkedIn News today. Here are quick snapshots of what those differences are: We know that most business professionals don’t have time to scour hundreds of news articles during their busy workday.  You want to quickly find the news your colleagues are reading today so you can keep up with the office water cooler conversations.  The “Most Activity” section of LinkedIn News promotes the most interesting articles your colleagues are reading, sharing, and discussing on LinkedIn.

In essence, this version of LinkedIn News has the potential to be the online version of the company watercooler where you get to discuss articles of interest in your professional spheres (company, industry, etc...) One thing that sets LinkedIn News apart from more traditional community-driven news sites is that our news discussions always take place within your semi-private company group. Any news discussion started on LinkedIn will only be visible to co-workers who’ve been confirmed to work at your company. This secure discussion environment will hopefully encourage the sharing of candid and insightful commentary amongst colleagues you work with everyday. Of course, a discussion isn’t going to be very interesting if nobody knows it’s happening! Whenever you create a discussion or comment on a LinkedIn News article, we’ll notify your LinkedIn connections that work at your company, asking them to join the discussion.  These notifications will show up in your colleagues Network Updates feed on their LinkedIn home page.

On the engineering side, this new features leverages a MiniProfile service we put in place a number of months ago for replicating a summary of profile data, along with some other data aggregation, in order to have a more horizontally scalable means of accessing profile data wherever it’s needed on other parts of the site.

So, here's a quick wrap-up of my session which took place a couple of days ago on the \"Future of Corporate Blogging\". Rather than rehash what Lionel Menchaca, Kami Huyse (my fellow panelists) and I went over at SXSW, I figured this is probably the best time to go over the past, present and future of LinkedIn's corporate blogging efforts. When I started off at LinkedIn we probably belonged to a small group of web 2.0 companies that didn't have a blog. Well, we definitely wanted to do it the right way and not let it be just as a me-too effort.  I still remember going over with the team on whether or not we wanted to allow comments, which received an overwhelming \"D'uh\" from everyone involved. Some of the blogs I personally admire from a corporate blogging perspective are ( ) and ( ). Nicki has done a great job with Yodel Anecdotal allowing a diverse array of internal Yahoo! teams the opportunity to speak to the user through blog posts, while Lionel with his team at Dell have highlighted Dell's user-focus with social media properties such as the and . Our goals for the LinkedIn blog have been focused on two broad categories: User education on the newest LinkedIn feature and being a reliable source of LinkedIn news with plenty of opportunity for user feedback. Currently these are the two broad categories of blog posts you see on LinkedIn:     Based on user feedback we realize that the most important category (from a user perspective) is of course - product feature announcements.  So, now we've upped the ante (I've always wanted to say that) with regular (by the product manager) for all major feature releases as well as (whenever appropriate) and maybe a every once in a while!

Since , I've been helping evolve the communications system into a highly scalable messaging platform. This release is very exciting for us as it builds upon the foundation we've put in place, making features like Status possible. One of the key value propositions of LinkedIn is being informed about what your network is doing.  This awareness can come in many forms: what questions are my connections asking?  What news is my network reading?  Propagating this information out to the LinkedIn network in a scalable manner is a difficult problem, but provides tremendous value to the end user.  In order to support  this going forward, we began to create a unified service that would provide network updates to users. We've converted our back end to use this new service, and late last year we used the new Network Updates Service to create a time-based feed of the events in your network.  We are currently processing over 40 million updates posted daily, which will continue to increase as the network grows.  For someone like myself who has recently graduated from university, this is a daunting number, and yet, it's why I continue to enjoy working at LinkedIn. To handle this capacity, we use a cluster of ActiveMQ machines for distributed JMS processing, EHCache for fast in-process caching, and an efficient update procedure for when new updates are persisted.  We've designed the system to be scalable right from the start, horizontally partitioning across multiple databases as growth demands. We will continue to provide new updates into your feed, and for those of you who do not visit the site regularly, you will be receiving these updates in a bi-weekly email so you can be kept up to date with the latest activity in your network. I would like to thank the team that worked on the Status feature, particularly (Web Development), James Lau (Engineering), and (Engineering). If you would like to hear more details our messaging platform, or engineering at LinkedIn in general, I will be speaking at some upcoming conferences along with and : - SDWest, March 4, 7:00pm - 8:30. - JavaOne, May 3-6 2008 - Velocity, June 23-24, 2008, Burlingame CA And, at the events particularly the SD West Birds of a Feather event, \"There Will be Pizza\"!"},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Mario Sundar","title":"LinkedIn Answers' Question of the Week | Productivity","date":"March 3, 2008","content":"Last week's question of the week from , has .

Today, in addition to the new homepage redesign that Elliot demoed, I'd like to call out a few nifty features that'll most definitely enhance the way you relate to your professional network each time you log into LinkedIn. Feel free to check out a quick demo below, of the three feature upgrades followed by a quick summary after the jump: http://www.youtube.com/v/R_bTlnqZ1y8] In order to present you with the most appropriate messages in your LinkedIn Inbox, we've altered the logic so that your Inbox shows the five most recent actionable messages. We've also made it easier for you to take an appropriate action directly from the LinkedIn homepage ( ). Of course, clicking on the Inbox icon takes you to a full-fledged Inbox page, yet again within the consistent look-and-feel that Elliot described earlier. We're also giving you, the user, more control over what types of network updates you're currently viewing on your homepage. By clicking to \" \" (\"Homepage Settings\") under your \" \", you'll be able to choose: a. The kinds of updates you'd rather see on your homepage (photo updates, status updates, etc...) b. The number of updates you'd like to see on your homepage (10, 15, 20, etc...) Most professionals love sharing anecdotes, tidbits about their professional lives with one another and thus far on LinkedIn it wasn't possible to do so. Starting today, you should be able to update your current status on a daily basis, which should provide you not only an additional way to communicate effectively with your immediate network but also  tap into the knowledge network you're a part of. We do suggest status options such as \"working on...\", \"traveling to...\", \"looking for advice on...\", \"looking for a job...\" or \"reading...\"; but you also have the option to update status with any other professional tasks you're currently engrossed in. Imagine being able to let your network know that you're hiring or when you're planning a business trip or conference! Status information will be broadcast to your connections as a network update and will also appear as a new element on your profile page. Given our focus on ensuring user privacy, you will have the option to control your status visibility. Additionally, LinkedIn members can choose whether they want to see the status in their network updates feed. --- Feel free to leave comments. Your feedback is much appreciated.

Feel free to leave your feedback in the comments section of this blog post. http://www.youtube.com/v/8vYunFv4oMA] As I described in the demo, there are three parts to the homepage redesign: We've gradually transitioned away from a system of tabs to one of drop-down menus. Check out the horizontal top bar which exemplifies this the best. We've also created a consistent personal navigation bar vertically, which you use to manage the various elements of your professional network. This component can be found right below the vertical personal navigation bar on the left. What this allows you to do is figure out how exactly you are presenting your professional identity, how up-to-date and accurate the information is and basically how complete your LinkedIn network is. This profile snapshot also contains the new Status feature . In addition to the above enhancements, LinkedIn's redesigned home page includes several customizable modules that I've hinted at in .

Our most recent news announcement came early this morning and gathered a slew of attention from some top tier publications. As you probably already know, Bill Gates, the Chairman of Microsoft is asking LinkedIn's 20 million users to give him advice about how to get youths involved in science and technology. All LinkedIn members are being granted permission to give answers/make suggestions to Bill's question in real time. It has already received almost 2000 answers. Take a peak at a few of The LinkedIn Blog's favorite pieces on this particular announcement: 1. The New York Times | Mr. Gates' appearance presents something of a marketing opportunity for the Mountain View, Calif., social network. To coincide with his appearance, Microsoft is buying ads across the site today. It also helps Linkedin promote an unrelated round of changes to the site, including a redesign that allows users to organize blocks of information, or modules, on their profile page, and to write a short statement that keeps their contacts updated on their current doings. 2. The Wall Street Journal | It isn't the first time public figures have used LinkedIn and other networking sites as a platform. In this election year, there's been a lot of online attempts to \"connect\" ordinary citizens and the candidates. Five months ago, presidential contender Barack Obama posted a question on LinkedIn. 3. Associated Press | Bill Gates Links Up with LinkedIn Microsoft Corp.'s big bet on Facebook's online social network isn't stopping Chairman Bill Gates from promoting other popular Internet hangouts. Gates is helping out LinkedIn Corp.'s online professional network by setting up a profile on the service and posing a question to help draw more attention to a makeover of the Web site's front page. The AP article also appeared in reprinted versions on a number of other sites like , , and . 4. Network World | Social networking has not always been kind to Gates, although he is said to enjoy the technology. Last year, he ran into trouble with his Facebook site when he was overwhelmed with \"Friends\" requests and had to shut down his site. Microsoft since has made a $240 million investment in Facebook, although it is unclear whether Gates has returned. With LinkedIn, Gates can use privacy settings to prevent random people from asking him to connect to their network. 5. BloggingStocks.com | To me, LinkedIn's Q&A feature is great (I've even used it to get sources for my stories). Although, as for Bill, I'm sure there will be a flood of questions.

To start, log into your account and go to your Account and Settings and take a look at the following features. 1. This feature gives you control over the exact amount of information you want displayed on the web. Search engines index LinkedIn and display elements of your profile. Please note that under Public Profile you are enable things such as; summary, interests, and many others. LinkedIn also allows you to add photographs to your profile. You may select who has the ability to see your photo. You can select your connections, your network, or everyone. LinkedIn has created a feature called “Who’s viewed my profile”. This feature displays a notification describing some information about the individual who viewed the profile. You have the control as to what information is displayed if you view someone’s information. With this setting you are given the choice to just have your first name and last initial displayed publicly. This setting is intended to stop people you have not connected with from knowing your last name. People you have already connected with see your last name in their connections list. Display names are important to have set correctly because this is how people will find you within LinkedIn.

I'm not going to attempt to reproduce the full here on this blog.   The basic concept is fairly simple: The theory of the Long Tail is that our culture and economy is increasingly shifting away from a focus on a relatively small number of \"hits\" (mainstream products and markets) at the head of the demand curve and toward a huge number of niches in the tail. As the costs of production and distribution fall, especially online, there is now less need to lump products and consumers into one-size-fits-all containers. In an era without the constraints of physical shelf space and other bottlenecks of distribution, narrowly-target goods and services can be as economically attractive as mainstream fare. Two weeks ago, Tim O'Reilly wrote an excellent post about . Tim did an excellent job covering the basics of Mike's talk, and providing a frame of references against our existing LinkedIn Answers product. However, there is a broader concept here that affects everyone's daily usage of LinkedIn, including mine.  I hinted at it months ago when I highlighted how much I enjoy .  You could say that it's recognizing the power of the long tail of professional expertise. LinkedIn now has close to 20 million professionals on it, many of whom have detailed descriptions of their education, their experience, and their skills.  As LinkedIn swells in size, searches that used to return hundreds of results can now return millions.  More importantly, searches that used to return zero results are now starting to return hundreds.  Believe it or not, the latter fact is really the exciting opportunity. So many of our people-related search tasks today are hampered by a lack of granularity.  A hiring manager looking for the perfect candidate.  A business development manager looking for the perfect lead.  A journalist looking for the perfect source. As LinkedIn grows in size, the ability to tap into the long tail of expertise grows, and with it, your ability to find exactly the set of experiences you are looking for. Those millions of members translate into hundreds of thousands of companies, thousands of degrees, and hundreds of industries across the globe. Whereas before you might have been satisfied with a simple search for , you can now search for a In my network, even this fairly specific query generates 14 results. As a result, when using LinkedIn, consider the fact that one of the major benefits of the site is not only finding people with exactly the right expertise, but it's also being found yourself.  It's a good reminder to , to , and round out . Make sure to take your place in the long tail of expertise."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Mario Sundar","title":"LinkedIn Answers' Question of the Week | Retirement and Estate Planning","date":"February 18, 2008","content":"As we roll out the LinkedIn Answers' question of the week on the blog, let's stick to the theme of Personal Finances for this week as well. Here's a question that many professionals grapple with during their work life: And, more importantly, when I switch jobs are there any advantages/disadvantages to rolling it into an annuity? Read on to find the Best Answer to above question. (Director of Marketing at Welsh & Katz) (Private Wealth Manager) As a Retirement Plan Specialist I can tell you the majority of the time the Rollover IRA is going to be your best bet. As a Certified Financial Planner I can tell you that the Majority of the time an Annuity is NOT appropriate. I am not saying that it is NEVER appropriate, so all the Insurance Reps can back off on the hate mail, I just know the Majority of the time (like 99% is my guess, ha ha). I look at Company Retirement plans daily and it is true that your investment selection is significantly less, but also the fees to be in the plan are many times much higher than doing it on your own. However, on occasion I have seen some 401(k) plans that have GREAT investment options and very LOW fees and in those situations I suggest rolling into the company 401(k). Without knowing the details of your new 401k it is hard to say. The thing that is probably more important to know is that the rules for distribution from a 401(k) and IRA are NOT the same. I do not know what kind of money you are talking about here but if you have a sizable Rollover you may want to consider these differences in distribution rules. Each 401k plan is unique to the plan document. I would suggest you verify what is considered a hardship withdrawal from your plan adviser prior to making a decision. A Hardship withdrawal is defined as a financial hardship that is “immediate and heavy” where no other resources can be reasonably available to meet the need. Here are some examples: 1. Non-reimbursed Medical Bills - Provide copies of the medical bills and your insurance provider’s Explanation of Benefits statements (EOBs) showing the amounts covered and not covered by insurance. 2. Purchase of your principal residence: Attach copies of the contract and mortgage application. 3. Funeral expenses: Provide a copy of the bill showing that you are the responsible party and a statement indicating the amount of life insurance coverage carried by the deceased. 4. Tuition expenses: Attach a copy of the college or university’s bill showing the amount you owe for the next semester, quarter, or 12 month period. 5. Threat of foreclosure: Provide a copy of the notice you have received from your mortgage company or landlord regarding the implementation of eviction or foreclosure proceedings and evidence of the balance due. Keep in mind Hardship withdrawals still incur the 10% Penalty and 20% withholding for Taxes. I had one participant that wanted to withdrawal 401k money for the transportation and hotel cost incurred to take her child to have medically necessary surgery in another state and those expenses didn't qualify for withdrawal. NOW for the IRA distributions: It’s your money, you take it out, you pay 10% penalty and taxes. PERIOD! Of course there are exceptions to the 10% Penalty such as Death, Disability, First Home Purchase up to 10K, Qualified Education Expenses, Medical Expenses in excess of 7.5% of Income, Substantially equal payments, Distributions used to pay Medical Insurance Premiums after separation from employment & after 12 consecutive weeks of unemployment compensation. I am sure there are others but these are the most common, consult your CPA. Also if you plan to convert your IRA to a Roth in 2010 (regardless of household income) like I am suggesting to the majority of my clients, you will not be able to do that while it is in a Company 401k plan without terminating your employment. I favor the IRA because of the accessibility in the event you need access to YOUR money. If you do not qualify for a Hardship as defined by your Employers Plan Document you can NOT get at YOUR money unless you quit your job. AND unfortunately I am the one that has to tell that to 401(k) plan participants when they call in desperate need of their OWN MONEY.

These include the most popular news in your network and the ability to share and flag news items. Read on. As soon as you log in, you'll be able to see the summary capsule of LinkedIn News, which highlights the five most popular articles read by your professional network. We've also added four different tabs (Most Read, Company, Other companies, Industry) to this dashboard to help you navigate through news that's most relevant in your professional world. Since the dashboard provides you with only the five most popular articles in the four categories mentioned above, we also provide an option for you to click through the remaining articles in the most read list through the \"See More News\" link. One of the most requested updates for this feature has definitely been the ability to share news clips you find interesting with your professional network. With this update, you should be able to share news items both from the dashboard as well as from the expanded news segments. Clicking through the share icon should enable your sharing the news article with your professional network on LinkedIn. Given that time is of essence for any professional, we'd like to ensure that you and your peers are served only the most relevant news items within your professional network.

In the midst of such noise the easiest way to find clarity on unanswered questions would be to turn to your professional network on LinkedIn. And, that's exactly what (from our product team) did when he asked the following question on LinkedIn Answers under the \"Personal Taxes\" category. : Tax professionals offer a wide array of services in addition to tax preparation, such as tax planning, audit representation, et al. TurboTax can't represent you during an IRS audit or before the courts. You should go see a tax professional if you have opportunities to save money on your taxes by doing something before the end of the year - Is the AMT going to bite you? What can you do to prevent it? You should also go see a tax pro if you think that a position you want to take on your tax return has a chance of getting audited - Did you win a lawsuit with arrangements that could be construed as lost wages? You should definitely see a tax pro when it costs you more in terms of time and money when you do it yourself - How much did the box cost? How much time are you spending at the computer entering the information and what else could you have done with that time? Did you miss some nuance of the tax law that could have saved you some more money? Stock options are difficult to do on your own because an ISO isn't taxed when exercised for regular tax purposes, but is ordinary income for AMT purposes. This really hit home many years ago during the tech boom with the people who got hit with huge AMT tax bills because they exercised their ISOs and then the stock was sold at a loss a few years later - Merlo, Tax Court, April 25, 2006. Real estate can be tricky because if buying and selling land is your job then the land counts as inventory and any gain would be ordinary income subject to self employment taxes if you file a schedule C. If you hold onto land as an investment then it is a capital gain. But what if the land also includes a house? What is the value of the house versus the value of the land? Is it your primary residence? Is it a rental? Did it switch from a rental to your primary residence? Do you want to figure out the depreciation every year? What would the depreciation be? When you have more questions than answers for a particular area of the tax return, you should see a tax professional. ---  I started using an accountant soon after having kids. Not that kids changed my financial position so drastically (love those little tax deductions, love 'em to death!) but because I simply didn't have time for it. You'll find that hiring a preparer is a wash, kind of. You still have to gather and understand your documentation, which takes time. That said, sticking with a good one means you'll start to see a consistency in the work, you'll notice deduction opportunities throughout the year, and you'll rest assured that (in most cases), a pro will be aggressive on your behalf without being nutty. I would never go back, for one. My tax guy runs me about $350 a year (deductible as well) but it's absolutely worth both my time and the satisfaction of knowing it's done right and to my advantage. And, there's more. Feel free to check out , all of which provide unique perspectives that may prove valuable for the tax season.

Many of you have probably either created, broken or still working on a final list of resolutions for this year. Here are five resolutions that professionals can make and keep this year, to jump start their career. Your online image can affect the way other professionals see you, just as much as your offline image. Create your own online professional brand by developing a LinkedIn profile. Make sure to keep information on your professional experience and other relevant information up-to-date. You may be surprised to learn how many recruiting executives use online networks to locate potential candidates. Also, if you're keen on building an impressive professional brand, make sure personal information intended for close friends stays private on the web. You don't want coworkers and potential employers looking at personal photos of your vacations and party shots. If you're curious about who is checking out your online brand, you can use LinkedIn's \"Who's Viewed My Profile\" feature to find out. In order to get leads and recommendations through your network, it's important to keep in touch with former colleagues as well as your present circle. LinkedIn allows professionals to remain at the forefront of people's minds by easily and efficiently keeping in touch. Using LinkedIn, it's easy to see who's been promoted, switched jobs, moved, won an award, and more. LinkedIn's InMail messaging system is a perfect way to reach out and keep your connections fresh, without cutting into your personal time. Being a great leader is not always about becoming an expert at everything -- it's really about knowing where to find knowledge and expertise when you need it. The LinkedIn Answers feature allows professionals to quickly and easily solicit input and gain perspective from their own connections or from the broader LinkedIn community. Learn how others approach new markets, revamp processes, and resolve problems. Draw on the collective knowledge of your trusted connections -- and their connections -- and benefit from the experience of others. Everyone understands the importance of time management in today's accelerated workplace environment. Successful people are often sought after with requests from unknown people for meetings, events, speaking engagements, and more. The LinkedIn network can be used to quickly and efficiently check out these contacts and requests before committing. A quick search reveals anyone you might know in common, gives you a capsule impression, and helps you allocate your valuable time wisely. And if you need to prepare for a meeting, the Advanced Search feature can also save time by allowing you to find specialists on almost every topic, industry, or company you want to research. If you want to be truly great at what you do, it's essential to stay on top of industry news at all times. LinkedIn News makes it easy for every professional to read the articles they need to read, by leveraging the power of their business connections. It starts by delivering news about key daily topics: a user's company, industry, and competitors, drawn from more than 10,000 publishers and blogs. Then, LinkedIn News uses the wisdom of each user's \"crowd\" of colleagues to determine the handful of articles that are the most important to their business -- the articles they need to read that day. LinkedIn News is currently available in beta to a select group of users, and will be expanded to all LinkedIn members in the New Year. --- Also, check out 's here.

Since everyone is getting ready for a great 2008, I thought this might be a good time to share one new trick I learned a few weeks ago: I am sure you know the scenario:  you have two connections, A & B.  A & B don't know each other, but you know each would benefit from the introduction.  The question is, how do you do it? The answer: . In November, LinkedIn introduced on-site messaging to the platform.  This means that you can go to any profile page, click the \" \" button right next to the photo, and send a quick message to any of your direct connections.  This type of one-to-one messaging is incredibly valuable, and has become one of the ways that I easily keep in touch with contacts when I need to communicate with them. However, LinkedIn messaging also supports one-to-many messages, which means you can send a single message to up to 20 of your connections.  Simply click the \" \" link on the message window, and you'll be taken to a full form where you can add other connections or email addresses to your message.  A very speedy type-ahead feature automatically guesses the name that you are typing by looking at all of your connections. So, now, when I want to make a mutual introduction, I just follow these steps: As soon as I click send, both of my connections get a message in their LinkedIn inbox and through email with the message.  As an added bonus, if I select the checkbox on the message form, both people can also get easy access to the other person's email address.  Person A & B can either respond to everyone using a LinkedIn message, just to me, or even reply through normal email. As a shortcut, you can actually do this even more quickly by just clicking directly to your LinkedIn inbox on the site, and then clicking the menu item to \" \". When we launched messaging, we didn't intend it to be used specifically for mutual introductions, but it's a common enough request from our users that it's great to see that you can now do it on the platform.  We'll be looking for ways to make this even easier and more effective in 2008."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Mario Sundar","title":"2007's Top 5 LinkedIn Blog posts","date":"January 4, 2008","content":"This past year has seen the consolidation of the LinkedIn Blog as the source for all information about LinkedIn Features, Events, and LinkedIn News in general.

Instead of the tab system on the site today, we’ve implemented a set of drop-down menus for the key site functions (People, Jobs, and Answers) and an additional personal navigation area for managing your own Profile and Network. We hope that this updated style makes it easier to navigate the site and serves to better highlight the key functionality of LinkedIn to all of our members. As we complete the Beta testing, we hope to bring this navigation to the rest of the site as well. • – Right below the personal navigation area, is your new professional dashboard reflecting your key profile and network information. We hope that this dashboard serves as an easy reminder of the current state of your LinkedIn profile and network – allowing you to easily manage your LinkedIn professional identity and your network contacts. • – Last but not least, right below the advertisement in the right column is a new area for customizable application modules. This where you can install applications that leverage your LinkedIn network to deliver the opportunities you need. There are 3 modules available right now (with many more to come soon): o – allows you to search for people in your network that can help you accomplish your professional goals o – allows you to search for jobs that are of interest o – allows you to monitor the questions LinkedIn members are asking their networks and the responses they are getting. When you first look at the page, you’ll note that we pre-installed some modules that we thought might be interesting. You can edit the searches that these modules conduct by clicking on the “edit” link next to the module’s title and can add additional modules via the “Add a Module” button at the bottom. You can also remove modules by clicking the “x” button in the module’s title and even drag-and-drop the modules in order to rearrange them. Anyway, we hope you enjoy the changes.

In fact, Nielsen numbers recently showed LinkedIn growing at a than Facebook. 1. | As a better destination, LinkedIn would experience higher levels of user engagement and more page views, which in turn would translate into greater advertising revenue. 2. | It's a sensible upgrade, building on LinkedInâs business focus. Over time, LinkedIn will look more like a personal professional portal than simply place to network with business associates. 3. | LinkedIn's new features now put it a step ahead of the competition. In sum, LinkedIn is trying to cement itself as the center of business networking by creating a set of features that make its large database of business relations more valuable. 4. | To sum up: They're designed to make the business person's social network that much more sticky, and from what we can tell, they seem potentially cool! 5. | This is something we've been really looking forward to.

LinkedIn can connect your candidate with voters, fundraisers, and volunteers. It can communicate your campaign’s message to highly influential business professionals, targeting voters in specific geographic areas. And it can trigger conversations that mobilize grassroots support for any candidate. Use the “Profile” sections to distinguish your candidate from the pack, to extend the communication lines of a government official, or to tout the successes of a campaign consultant. Check out these examples: (Junior Senator from Nevada), (US Senator, Presidential Candidate), (Media strategist). Claim the “name plate” web link like these profiles do, and move your profile to the top of a Google hit list. Use LinkedIn’s “InMail” or “Invitation” functions to reach influential voters, including high-level executives and professional audiences. The average LinkedIn member has a household income of $109,000; 75% are 29 or older. Use the “Advanced Search” function to find and target voters and potential contributors in specific geographic areas, at specific companies, or within specific industries. Use the “Answers” feature to get pertinent input from LinkedIn’s 16 million engaged business professionals on issues that matter to them—and to answer their questions. Use the “Recommendations” feature on your candidate’s profile to post endorsements from key interest and constituent groups. Use the “Websites” link on that profile to direct viewers to your candidate’s or campaign consultant’s website or blog. Create a “Groups” page for your candidate or official to promote top issues and concerns directly to supporters. Create a digital bumper sticker on your candidate’s “Groups” page that supporters can add to their profiles. Add a LinkedIn logo to a candidate's home page that will allow voters to one click to get to your LinkedIn profile and connect with like minded voters. Use the “Jobs & Hiring” feature to turn up the right people to work on your campaign."},{"post_categories":["New LinkedIn Features"],"author":"Lucian Beebe","title":"LinkedIn's Intelligent Application Platform","date":"December 10, 2007","content":"Several months ago, we are working on APIs and a platform strategy for software developers to integrate with LinkedIn and display their application within LinkedIn. With , you can now see a lot more about how you can write applications that run inside LinkedIn. So, if you are a developer, what opportunities do you now have? There is a compelling opportunity to build on the LinkedIn platform, whether you are trying to augment your application with LinkedIn features or deliver your application into the LinkedIn web site. LinkedIn is a business network of nearly 17 million professionals, growing faster than one million new members per month. And people use LinkedIn for one purpose: to improve the way they do business. Have a great business-focused application? Something that improves productivity? You won’t find a more receptive or larger professional audience than you will at LinkedIn. Using LinkedIn, you will get that productivity application in front of more people faster than any other way on the Internet. The LinkedIn Intelligent Application platform enables two things: • . Using LinkedIn APIs and widgets, you will be able to integrate LinkedIn into your application by accessing information from a LinkedIn user’s network. Using this model, you can augment your web site with LinkedIn features, creating more utility on your site and the chance to stand out from the crowd. • . You will be able to write professionally-oriented applications that run inside LinkedIn.com for maximum visibility in a purely business network. We have and will add other models in the future. Over the past months we have been talking to hundreds of partners about how they would like to integrate LinkedIn into their applications. It’s become clear that there is a very strong need to let LinkedIn users take their network with them as they use the web to be more productive. Most every task we do on the web could be augmented by including the help, filter, or aggregate knowledge or our professional network. So, we will provide a set of REST APIs and widgets that will let you build applications that include your user’s LinkedIn network. For example, when someone comes to your application and authorizes your application to use their LinkedIn account, you’ll be able to use their profile, their network, other LinkedIn profiles, network update feeds, and many other aspects of their LinkedIn account to enrich your application with pure professional networking. You will be able to build and run applications inside LinkedIn. We have announced support for Google’s Open Social platform and will include other ways in the future as well. In this model, you’ll be able to create an application that uses your own UI and back end and is augmented with the LinkedIn APIs. These applications will display within the LinkedIn.com web site and will be aware of the current LinkedIn user and his/her network. You’ll be able to create applications that run on user’s home and profile pages and more in the future. But to leverage this distribution engine, you have to have a business productivity application. We recognize that business people have social lives and there are places for that. LinkedIn will remain focused on improving the productivity of people doing business and we’ll work with people fitting that standard. We’ll be phasing all of this in over the coming months and to get involved with the Intelligent Application Platform either for APIs, widgets, or hosted applications. --   -   If you haven't already, for latest news on LinkedIn."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Life"],"author":"Adam Nash","title":"Breaking New Ground: More Engineers, More Room!","date":"November 12, 2007","content":"Well, we're not exactly breaking new ground, per se.

Before we get into the specific articles, many of you may have read the post by Adam Nash about , and today we have a video of the LinkedIn Open Social presentation that Adam made at the Google Campfire event (04:30) http://www.youtube.com/v/VCEydxaxQdg&rel=1&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6&border=0] Here are three other topics that encompassed LinkedIn themes these past few weeks, starting off with a Nielsen Netratings' report that highlighted LinkedIn as the fastest growing social network: The blogosphere gravitated towards a Nielsen Netratings report ( ), which covered the fastest growing social networks (year over year). Here's a sampling of blogs on that topic: * Quick, what's the fastest-growing social network over the last year? MySpace?  Nope.  Facebook?  Nope.  Bebo?  Now, let’s be serious.  According to Nielsen Online ( ), it’s . . . LinkedIn. * While Facebook has been getting most of the attention of developers, LinkedIn's involvement in OpenSocial with Google et al. will foster creation of new application to help business folk advance themselves and their companies. Maybe it's my age (okay, yes it is my age), but I prefer to keep my social circle focused on people who I really know and do my socializing through email or on the phone with my expanded circle of friends and colleagues. Did you know that there are currently 145, 000 CEOs on LinkedIn. When polled on their political choices for Elections 08, : None of the 154 CEOs who responded to USA TODAY's survey said that they typically voted Democratic but intended to vote Republican in 2008. Still, Giuliani was the favorite. He also won in a scientific survey of small-business owners by payroll-processing company SurePayroll and a much larger unscientific survey of more than 2,000 CEOs by Vistage International, which says it's the world's largest CEO membership organization. LinkedIn, which says it has 145,000 CEOs signed up, found Clinton in the lead in a small, unscientific response. Vistage allowed its CEOs to vote undecided, which carried the day with 37%, followed by Giuliani (21%), Romney (11%), Clinton (9%) and Obama (7%). LinkedIn CEOs casting 446 votes online were 47% Republican and 44% Democratic. Of those, Clinton received 29% of the votes to 18% for Giuliani and 16% for Obama. Here are a couple of articles featuring Reid Hoffman's trip to Europe, which covers the a. His advice to entrepreneurs is simply: \"actually go and do it!\". Websites are much cheaper now to build, he said, and once you hit a 'spark', it can quickly turn into a forest fire. Base your innovations on cultural needs and focus on adding new tools – \"if you don't add anything new, then – bang!\". And he should know – after leaving PayPal in October 2002, he assembled a team to start on LinkedIn in November. \"I couldn't take a holiday\", Mr Hoffman said, \"Venture finance thought the web was dead back then, but I thought networking sites were going to be big. \"I wanted to go one step further: finance the social networking sites, and start building the professional networking sites.\" LinkedIn is now the largest professional networking site in the UK, with 1m users. It has a high calibre of members too – senior executives for 96 of the FTSE 100 companies have their own LinkedIn profile pages. In the US, all of the Fortune 500 companies have an executive level presence. b. founder Reid Hoffman said that the discussion about a new web bubble is usually too simplified. Costs of hardware, software and bandwidth are all far less this time around, and the ad market online is far greater. \"There will be some trough and companies being corrected, but relatively few.

Given below is the question followed by answers found both on LinkedIn Answers as well as across the blogosphere on the same topic: , responds to on LinkedIn Answers : Someone on LinkedIn just posed this question “ “. Here are my thoughts on this, this may not be all that leads to a successful blog, but these are for me pretty essential ingredients: Focus, Passion, and Originality. Here's the original question: And, here's Karl's response that was chosen as Best Answer: - I think one of the most important choices a blogger makes when they start their blog is what their focus is. Think about a first time visitor getting dropped on your blog from a search engine or stumbleupon, are they going to understand in 2 seconds exactly what your blog is about? If the answer is yes you will build a readership and you will have a successful blog. If not, you may well build a successful blog but it will take years as opposed to months. - This is the only possible way that you will be able to sustain regular posting of a high enough quality over the course of years. If you don't have the passion your blog will become a ghost town very quickly. People talk about the passion in the writing, and how important it is for readers, but IMHO the passion is all about the ability to sustain you through the emotional roller coaster ride of writing a blog. Sure your passion will come through in your writing, but it is your passion that will keep you plugging away when no one is coming back, no one is commenting, and no one is linking to you. Passion may not be the only thing that will drag you along, but it is the most enjoyable so unless you are a masochist you better love what your talking about. - In branding terms, what differentiates you from the crowded playing field of blogs all talking about the same thing. They don't call the blogosphere an echo chamber for nothing, because most of the time everyone is reflecting and amplifying what else is happening around the blogosphere. Original content and original ideas in the blogosphere stand out like beacons in the night, and not to labor the metaphor but they also attract other bloggers like moths to a flame :-) Other's seem to also triangulate on three key factors, like Primary focus is (still King). As Kathie wrote: I write about subject I'm passionate about, I consider worthy to notify and share. Second: . If you're not planning to write posts on a regularly basis, you forget your audience. They'll not take your blog seriously. Third: to search engines, RSS aggregators, listings, social networks, fellow bloggers.

It is studied in the best economics universities as a successful case study. eBay has a well documented case of successful customer communities in Germany. Intuit has well documented customer communities. Harley Davidson uses customer communities as part of their new product development very successfully. WebMD, CarSpace, Samsung, etc... Well, I'm biased, but I really am impressed by the various community activities that LEGO has done and continues to do - from developing relationships on existing fan sites to the multitude of activities on LEGO.com for kids, to projects like LEGO Factory, etc. Macromedia used to be my shining example of how to engage your consumers.

So, here are a couple of interesting articles we found this past week on building your personal brand: An from the popular blog, highlights 5 tips on protecting your personal brand online. It’s important to note that as you build your brand and reputation, you take significant time to ensure integrity and accuracy. You never want to Google your name and find that you are misrepresented by a blogger or a comment on your Facebook wall. As you become a web worker, you want to establish a daily means of checking your status. There are way too many people that lose opportunities from what employers have seen online As we've outlined in prior posts, particularly the , LinkedIn is probably the easiest way to get started on strengthening your online brand with a focus on your professional accomplishments: Branding is something that we as professionals need to take very seriously on an individual level. Ten years ago, Tom Peters penned an article for Fast Company called “ ”, which stressed that it’s absolutely imperative for all professionals to develop a unique and personal “professional brand” that communicates the value they have to offer to prospective employers, employees, clients and business partners. Liz Ryan, the Savvy Networker asks , once again draws attention to the importance and the value of your online brand: A majority of employers now routinely check their job candidates' MySpace, Linkedin and Facebook profiles for any impropriety, prior to making an offer. Can you blame them? It's not so much that your prospective employer worries about your keg parties or those photos of you with your favorite bong. It's that they worry, with reason, about your judgment in throwing these items online for anyone to see. I'd like to once again draw attention to the above mentioned on how LinkedIn allows you to control that professional brand of yours most effectively: That idea (of the \" \") was true then and it’s even more true today. The major search engines and social networks have made all of us far more accessible and visible than ever before, making it so much more critical that we actively manage our own professional brands. And that’s where LinkedIn really shines, allowing you to take control of the major elements of your professional brand: the people you associate with, the questions you ask and the answers you provide, the recommendations you give and receive, and the way in which you express your experiences and skills. Have you begun nurturing your professional brand online as you do offline?

Here's something to ponder: So LinkedIn will have to approve any company that wants to tap into its system. Mr. Nye says he is looking for two kinds of applications. First, there are deals that enable LinkedIn members to tap into their connections in other places, for example, while using applications like Salesforce.com. Second, some applications will be allowed to add features to LinkedIn’s own site. Mr. Nye offered, as an example, a module connected to a trade show or conference that integrated travel planning and other features. (Read entire article ) As an adjunct to that post, Dan, is also answering questions posed by readers of the New York Times. The questions asked ranged from LinkedIn features like Groups, kudos, competition to tips on usage. Here's a snippet from Dan's response: All (18 questioners so far) – Thank you for your questions. I appreciate your interest in LinkedIn, thank you for being members/subscribers and look forward to addressing your issues and concerns about the service. LinkedIn is a young company that is pursuing a big dream and big idea. Our goal is to build a productivity tool to help professionals to be the even better at what they do. We do this by helping people a) present themselves in a professional way on the internet, b) find people with unique skills, knowledge and experience, c) reach people who can help them accomplish their goals, d) get advice from their networks and LinkedIn at large, e) find opportunities, f) acquire new clients/deals. Of course, the underlying foundation of LinkedIn is the relationship network built. However, it is the quality of the people, the user generated content, utility of the applications and the breadth/quality of content that make it useful. I receive email and InMail messages daily from members who write to express their excitement about the service. I hear stories about members finding friends and colleagues they haven’t spoken to in decades, entrepreneurs who find business partners, professional service providers acquiring new clients through the Services recommendations, recruiters who find candidates, companies who find talent, members who find the “perfect job”, line managers who are amazed by the quality of the advice they receive from the Answers area or a decision they made after conducting an “off-line” reference check…etc. While these positive stories and comments are rewarding, we are well aware that LinkedIn can be improved and that many members haven’t yet discovered the power of the service. For those of you who fall in to that category, I assure you that we are working very hard on features and product designs that I think you will love. With this as background, I will respond to your questions as follows (For the rest of the responses, please check out the ) The questions to Dan can be accessed on .

Continuing in the same vein, this week we have a question from , , on the state of startups and small businesses these days. The question is: The answers are streaming in. We have thus far and here are a few thought-provoking ones: The sip cash model assumes that the investment market stays fluid. If things get tight like 2002-2004. Right now there are perhaps too many investors chasing too few good deals, so cash is relatively cheap. Raising cash is also a distraction. James Currier also has a point about \"Hitting It Hard\" and not wasting time raising money when execution is more important. The on the STIRR news blog. | I fall into the \"little cash\" camp. There are many internet startups that require little more than a couple cheap computers and a decent server hosting service, nothing more. I couldn't have said it better, take what little cash you need to grow organically on customer revenue and that's it. If, for reasons not mentioned here, you need a large cash infusion to get started, give considerable thought to your exit strategy. How will you compensate your investors (Angels, VCs, friends, etc.) and when? Are you going the M&A or the IPO route? Will this cash go to SG&A or to compensate an algorithm-wielding scientist? Lastly and perhaps most important is your startup idea defensible? Can you create large entry barriers against your competition? For how long? Will you have competition? (This is both good and bad.) All of this should impact your decision whether or not to seek out cash. There are three factors to be considered before answering this for your situation. 1) It's not an issue of cash, it's more an issue of dilution and control. If I could raise $20M for 5% of a startup right now, I'd obviously do it. But, it should be clear that giving up control early is always a mistake. 2) If you had the financial discipline, it reduces risk to take more cash, if you don't have that skill, then taking less cash reduces risk. Be honest with your yourself, know your weaknesses. Ask your wife/husband if she/he thinks you know how to spend money wisely. Spouses usually know the answer better than you. 3) It depends on the cash needs of the business. Some businesses don't need a ton of capital, some can borrow against receivables earlier than others. Run the projections and decide that for yourself. If the business needs so much money, that you would loose control after raising your first round, then don't start that company. I have found over the years that an effective and appropriate prototype done as lean as possible benefits an investors decision as it shows you can think out of the box, save your pennies, show initiative and innovation. As with any investment the investor is looking at your acumen and the ability to wisely use their money. An example of this was www.mobileadcasting.com whose product similar, but very different to www.bluecasting.com, and www.proximitymedia.com was able to build its solution for $427k, then obtain its funding, as opposed to the others whom spent upwards of $6 - $12M to the same end. So I suggest you utilize the resources and knowledge you have at your disposal and attack on both fronts. There you have it, a snapshot of the conversation generated by Jon Burke around the startup environment these days. If you've a relevant question in any of the LinkedIn categories that you'd like answered, let us know and we'll feature it in our weekly blog series on LinkedIn Answers."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn in the News"],"author":"Mario Sundar","title":"LinkedIn News Roundup: Leadership tips to Design tricks","date":"October 8, 2007","content":"If you were to pick just one blog post from our blog to read per week what would it be: a , a , a or our .

Suitable examples would range from early pure-play social networks that had the ability to hack in \"widgets\" to platforms that allowed for building any type of social network and finally a platform that's built on a broad social graph.

However, before we could add photos to the site, we had to give considerable thought to the best way to integrate photos into a professional site. Privacy is an incredibly important issue to us, and we wanted to make sure we had the right controls in place.  As a result, all members will have the option to control whether their photo is visible to their connections, their network, or everyone. In addition, we know that there may be some professionals who would prefer to not be exposed to profile photos from people they may not know.  As a result, members can also control their ability to see the photos of other members.  In fact, we've also taken special care to design the site so that while photos integrate seamlessly into the experience, there is no degradation of the experience when photos are not visible. A good professional photo is cropped and centered, and as a result we've spent some time to provide a simple, rich interface for users to upload large photographs and edit them down to a professional headshot. We know that people take their professional reputations seriously, and as a result we expect LinkedIn profile photos to be professional in nature.

Enter LinkedIn. It is a networking site for professionals, businesses and entrepreneurs. When you join LinkedIn, you create a profile that summarizes your business accomplishments. You then use that profile to locate colleagues, clients, associates, and friends. These folks become part of your LinkedIn network. But the best part is that because your people have their own network, your network expands geometrically to include your connections' connections, linking you to thousands of qualified professionals. Let's say you need a lead with a business. Well it just may be that within your expanded LinkedIn network, you will have that lead. Once you create your network, and you look someone up, say, Barack Obama, their profile will say • \"See who you and Barack Obama know in common\" • \"Get introduced to Barack Obama\" • \"Contact Barack Obama\" It's sort of like that parlor game .

After all, wasn't I the savvy networking guru?  But, after a few months of reading a bit and byte here and there about LinkedIn, I knew it was time and connected with Konstantin. In fact, I mentioned LinkedIn in my last two books because of its impact. Interestingly enough, some of the people I invited to join me, ignored my invite in those days. I find it interesting that some of them have now (several years later) sent me invites. They finally saw the light of being LinkedIn. One of the best aspects for me, is going to my network to ask a question, knowing that these people will respond with information if they have it. What is also fun for me is to visit the Answers section and go through questions. If there is something I know or know someone who does, I take the time to address the question and this has led to my strengthening loose ties. LinkedIn allows for old school manners and as well as connecting in the new school style. That really is the essence of networking: sharing ideas and information and having a resource network to approach when I am stumped. The last joy of LinkedIn for me is reconnecting with old friends. Out of the blue, someone from my past business life appears in my Inbox and it is a fun \"you never know\" moment as if I had bumped into them at an airport. I never just accept an invitation but also send an email to truly re-establish the contact, connection and some communication. As a speaker who addresses corporations and conventions, I feel good, smart and savvy to know that I am LinkedIn on more levels than I ever imagined."},{"post_categories":["Featured"],"author":"Mario Sundar","title":"What's the most interesting thing you've learned from Wikipedia?","date":"September 18, 2007","content":"It's another day in our week long LinkedIn Answers Q&A event, which has already featured thus far, questions from , , on tech entrepreneurship.

And that evidence had been preserved since even before WWI, when my grandmother (b. 1896) was still a teenager.

The penultimate question was from Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia who asked what your most interesting find on Wikipedia was ( ). So, finally here we are at the last question from Boston Globe columnist and Penelope Trunk who wonders ? Oh, boy! What do you think? Here are some responses I thought provided interesting perspectives from over : Here are a few answers that users have sent in since the question went live. There were many balanced responses from LinkedIn users. Here are a few responses thus far: | VP, Associate Creative Director at Grey Advertising (Worldwide) It looks like I'm in the minority but I don't really see it anymore, at least not around me. I feel like there are more and more women in the industry than ever before and I her about many women in executive positions. Of course, I'm a man so what do you expect? If anything, it's nothing like I see on \"Mad Men\". | Business Development Manager at Robert Schron Associates; experienced Equity Investment Analyst There is, but not so much in the traditional way people think of it. It is no longer based as much on shared heritage (e.g. family, ethnicity) as it is on having gone to the right school or worked for the right company. For example, on Wall Street being a local doesn't really count for anything today, as the hiring is global, but having gone to Wharton or having worked at Goldman Sachs will get you much further than having gone to NYU or having worked at PaineWebber, because the prestige factor is what is important now. Companies want to be able to say their people come from the top name-brand institutions regardless of whether they are from Boston or Bangalore. I imagine that in this process, alot of hardworking and intelligent people are left out, but the same was true of the old-stye networks as well so in that regard nothing has changed. If you want to succeed in this environment, you have to have gone to the right schools and worked in the right places, in some cases it doesn't even matter what you studied or what your performance was, because it's all about brand recognition. | Technical Director, Oracle Yes, there are still many 'good old boy' networks. But not as many as there have been. Also, with more women in the work place I have run into some 'new girl' networks. Sometimes people tend to just like to interact and work with people that look, act and think like themselves. Very unfortunate and the bright side is this attitude is changing! | Professor of Computer Science, University of California Yes, of course, but now it contains girls too. You tend to work with the people you know and trust. Absolute qualifications may show up on a resumé, but you only really know whether you can work with a person through personal experience or that of a person you trust.

The five questions brought in a total of nearly 4000 LinkedIn Answers! Stay tuned to the blog for a final tally of answers as well as the selected best answers from among the thousands of relevant answers. In the meanwhile, let's continue this week with the featured LinkedIn Answers \"Question of the week\". This week we have Pavak Shah, Commercial Director at Gateway Technolabs, ask what hurdles one has faced in outsourcing Software Services. Quite an interesting question in this flattened global landscape (just ask ). The question is still open so if you've a thought or two, feel free to leave your $.02 here.    Interesting question, you may think, but far more interesting are the answers that are streaming in. Here's a sampling of the LinkedIn Answers: I have had experience outsourcing in India, Canada, and Russia. The best experience by a wide margin has been with Russia. The most difficult place to work with has been China because of the language barrier (desisted after a few tries). Biggest hurdle is having a complete methodology in place, on both sides of the fence, with your own staff taking ownership of outsourced deliverables. Methodology simplifies communication/language issues, and I would recommend embedding your own staff into the outsourced process to ensure that deliverables are at the standards and usefulness that you expect. To my understanding Outsourcing a complete business process is always a challenging job. However, the key things that i have found interesting in my experience are: 1.) Processes are the key to success: Ensure that the company to which you plan to outsource as all the processes in place. 2.) Communication: Communication of the goals, vision and requirements is a must. Its very important that the offshore team clearly understands the requirements and comes up with the same vision. 3.) Core Competency framework: Its very essential that the offshore/outsourced team carries the basic core competencies required to execute the project. Some of the key hurdles that one may face in a offshoring/outsourcing relationship for software services are: - Inability to clearly define a successful Operating Model. It needs to be understood and agreed upon by both the vendor and buyer of offshore services. Establish calrity in roles and responsibilities in teams on both sides of the relationship. - Governance structures and escalation procedures need to realistic and actionable. No point in having a structure and processes in place, that do not work or cannot be put into action with enough rigour. The action part can only be ensured by an enabling organization culture, set of policies that drive the behaviour of people across levels to make things happen - Communication: put quality people and processes in place on both sides of the  chores/ relationship, so that high levels of mutual trust, reliability and transparency thrive through out the outsourcing relationship - Expectation management: Sub component of Communication but good to detail a bit on this...set realistic and clear expectations for each other and document key discussions, decisions for future reference of both teams. Give the bad news early and dont 'sit' on it thinking it will go away. - Track Risks and Issues: track them actively, assign responsibility to people to come up with mitigation plans and drive closure against a date and follow up - Transition points, hand offs and sign offs: These have to be clearly defined and acheived in time as per the processes defined and only then move to the \"next steps\"/phases - else they will become big hurdles for offshroing success resulting in loss of valuable time and money Definitely a lot to think about, although some of the key issues identified were similar across many answers.

With this expansion, we've also integrated geography into various features throughout the site. Let's have a look... Now, when you search for jobs around a specific postal code, you'll find all jobs within a 25 mile (40 km) radius of that postal code. On the advanced job search page, you can narrow or broaden this radius depending on your commuting requirements. This is a significant improvement from our previous system, especially outside of the US, and we hope job seekers will find this feature useful. We also changed the way we display regions throughout the site.  The , , , and pages have been enhanced to display more specific regions (outside the US). You'll notice people in your network now live in 'London', 'Paris' and 'Bangalore' instead of 'the UK', 'France', and 'India'. Have fun exploring your newly \"mapped\" network! Finally, we've also modified our People Search to include the same radius search ability that we added to Jobs Search. This feature was widely requested by our premium members-especially recruiters--so we're rewarding them with exclusive access to this powerful People Search functionality-they can now search as small as a 10 mile (15 km) radius. Basic LinkedIn members can still limit People Searches by distance, only the radius is fixed to 30 miles (50 km) in Europe and 50 miles (80 km) elsewhere. We'd also like to collectively thank for their generous donation of international postal code data, as it made our job of mapping postal codes to latitude/longitude coordinates for over 14 million members much easier.

( ) author of \"No A**hole Rule\" and Professor of Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, asked last week if power corrupts. Here's the question: to check out over 350 answers we've received thus far to this question. Bob talks about some of the interesting answers in a couple of blog posts, which can be accessed and . We took a spin through some of those answers and realized that a majority of them fall between; well, there were only two options here -- either \"Yes\" or \"No\", but we did find a slew of interesting responses from across the spectrum. Here they are:  True leaders use power as a catalyst for innovation and change. They empower their team members and help them achieve stretch goals. Rising pressure and demands are today's world order and leadership is exhibited by those who are proactive and use their power efficiently. (See Mohan's other LinkedIn Answers) The non-jerks in power have generally been reluctant to serve. The best way to limit the jerks is to draft decent people into the roles who would never seek them. (see Andrew's other LinkedIn Answers) Power corrupts in many cases. This is why when we see that down-to-earth powerful person, we are in awe, that truly humble celebrity. Interestingly, power doesn't have to corrupt. One can be competent, without wielding power unabashed. (see Kevin's other LinkedIn Answers) Power can corrupt to the extent that it reduces the powerful person's reliance on other's acceptance, which decreases the social pressure that helps one to avoid temptation. I would say that it is not power that corrupts. Perhaps the bad behaviour or at least the predisposition for bad behavior is there all along, and only becomes apparent when influence and scrutiny grow along with power. (see Chuck's other LinkedIn Answers) Power doesn't corrupt, rather it's society's treatment of power and how that power is used by the person wielding it. Getting used to 'giving in' to that feeling of entitlement (because you've attained a certain amount of power) is what transforms powerful people into massive jerks.  (see Jennifer's other LinkedIn Answers) I do not think power in itself corrupts. Certain prerequisites such as a lack of humility, a lack of self-confidence and misanthropic tendencies all contribute to lead to power madness. What is truly interesting is how these people can transfer this state unto the population. (see Louis' other LinkedIn Answers) Power often times does corrupt. Those who have power should spend some time giving back to the community. Those who are giving of time (which is harder to do then give money) aren't jerks. The way a powerful man or woman treats co workers and community members speaks volume about that person. Stop and think, if all this power left me when i wake up tomorrow, what would people think of me? If the answer is this guy is a jerk, it's time to start changing your image.

This week we've got some great articles that range from USA Today's dissection of LinkedIn's growth to the Washington Times that talks about professional networking in general. Given below are five appropriate news pieces, links to the articles and quotes from the articles themselves: 1. USA Today | : LinkedIn is drawing notice as perhaps the next big thing in the so-called Web 2.0 space of Internet social and professional networking companies. With 14 million members in the USA and overseas, the privately held LinkedIn could haul in $100 million in revenue next year from corporate and individual subscriptions and advertisements from Microsoft, Wal-Mart and other companies. Recruiters from Google , Yahoo and other companies use LinkedIn to seek job candidates, while individuals use it to broaden business networks and connect with colleagues, alumni and industry experts. 2. The Washington Times | : Mikolaj Jan Piskorski, an assistant professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, said the site has had a phenomenal effect on recruiting. \"There is a substantial set of people who are middle-level managers and slightly above, but we don't know who they are. They aren't high enough to make it into the 'who is who,' but at the same time they have high-enough positions in their companies that they cannot advertise themselves as looking for a job. In many ways, those people are kind of stuck,\" Mr. Piskorski said. \"LinkedIn has literally freed those people. The way it's done that is, it's sort of allowed people to advertise themselves on the market, say, 'Hey, here I am, not explicitly looking for a job, but I'm willing to entertain offers.' \" 3. Business 2.0 | : It's not just employees who have to adjust to the new screening processes. Employers are also prepping for interviews in ways they never did before. When LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman was searching for a new CEO earlier this year, he took an unusual approach to checking references. Having set his sights on a particular candidate, he used the LinkedIn network to find what he calls \"off-balance references\": 23 former associates who were not preapproved by the candidate. Some were friends of friends - two degrees removed, in LinkedIn parlance. Some had no idea who Hoffman was or why he was calling. The unscripted references helped to prepare the team that interviewed Hoffman's final choice. Equally important, Hoffman got unfiltered information about a potential top-tier employee, minimizing the likelihood of getting duped. \"Normally it's a low bar for someone to give you two or three people who'll say nice things about them,\" Hoffman says. \"Our way of doing it requires a bit of detective work, and you need to put a story together. But you quickly sense if a person is good or a sham.\" 4. Computer World | : Online networking sites such as LinkedIn can help you expand your connections and obtain more information. The more sources you consult, the better - if you hear a negative report from a disgruntled former employee, for example, try to balance it with the impressions of someone who works for the company now. The job interview is the best time to learn about a corporate culture. For example, take note of the workplace atmosphere. Do employees seem engaged with their work and one another, or under stress and isolated? 5. Boston Herald | : There are literally thousands of personal communities created around health and wellness issues, music, media, IT support and even nationality-based communities. In comparison, there are relatively few social networking sites that are endeavoring to enable the business professional, but they definitely exist, and it is worthwhile for the motivated businesswoman to seek them out Feel free to leave us a comment if there are news articles or blog posts we may have missed.

What many of you may not know is that LinkedIn also caters towards corporate solutions for the enterprise. Interestingly, not only do we have executives from every one of the Fortune 500 companies on LinkedIn, but most of those companies also have a corporate account with LinkedIn, including some companies you may have heard of: Microsoft, EMC, Salesforce.com, Kaiser Permanente, Target, etc... Check out a few of our company pages . The fundamental value of LinkedIn is allowing aspiring professionals access to unlimited career opportunities across these large growth organizations. Similarly we also help companies, both Fortune 500 companies as well as startups, find the perfect candidate in a passive way. A passive job seeker is usually the person that is reserved at the top of a hiring manager's wish list. They are usually employed, seasoned, accomplished professionally, and typically look for jobs through referrals and recommendations. These are not professionals that you'd typically find on a job board hoping for a new opportunity to pop up. LinkedIn bridges the gap between great companies looking to add top-tier talent, and people only available to the perfect opportunity at their dream company. As Director of Sales, it's definitely been a fun ride so far, and I'd love to hear from you about the great opportunities you've found through LinkedIn.

I'll admit, I was skeptical. I have been running for the past couple years but I've never surpassed 8 miles. Was this a message and how did the people at the know I could be convinced easily. Close on the heels of receiving that flyer from the AIDS foundation, I also heard that a close friend of mine tested positive for HIV. News of that magnitude tends to paralyze us; it only proves the reality of our helplessness when faced with issues too large to comprehend. Pessimism sets in. But one flyer was all it took to shake me out of it and soon I was sitting at an informational meeting watching a DVD of middle-aged marathon finishers, Chariots of Fire playing in my head. I was sold! Flash forward -- every Saturday I wake up at five or six, eat a bowl of oatmeal, fill up my water bottles and make sure I have enough Gu’s to correspond to the amount of hours I will be running. As I drive to the run site I remind myself of the elation that comes after completing a long run and how good it feels to have a training run completed with still an entire Saturday for myself. As a 25 year old on the cusp of 26, appreciation of life’s basic offerings sounds trite, however I do find myself appreciating life at a much more rudimentary level, not for what I might receive from accomplishment but for what I might receive from the act of working hard. I am raised for San Francisco AIDS Foundation and of course I wish I would have begun sooner and told more people but it is 3,000 dollars more than if I would have simply ignored the flyer in my mailbox and threw it out along with the grocery store flyers and credit card offers. Every Saturday I look forward to running with my pace group, we keep each other motivated and although anyone training for a marathon is a slight Type A we keep the competition to ourselves in our online training logs and GPS watches. As for my friend who was diagnosed with HIV recently; although at first he didn’t want to tell anyone and wondered if he would overcome such a life altering diagnosis it has in fact changed his life for the better. He was seeing the beauty in things easier and a healthy lifestyle had become his main priority. -- Related posts on some of our colleagues: 1. | 2. | 3. | 4. | 5.

You tell us...","date":"September 7, 2007","content":"Last week David Pogue, New York Times technology columnist and blogger, asked his readers a simple question: \" \" and had almost 100 answers from users on how they're using LinkedIn today. Before I reveal some of the answers, let me take a moment to describe my usage of LinkedIn, which started almost 2 years before I became the \"official\" evangelist for the service. There are four ways, LinkedIn has added value to my professional life: (a) take control of my online identity - prior to my own blog, my LinkedIn profile was the first result on searches, (b) find a dream job, (c) maintain & foster relationships with colleagues (past, present & future), fellow bloggers, peers I meet at events & speaking engagements, etc… (d) provide value to my professional network by recommending peers, answering their questions (LinkedIn Answers), etc… Well, I could go on, but what else do users use LinkedIn for? Here are eight simple answers culled from the comments section of David's post: , Director of Public Relations at iMemories, says it helps her The top 2 benefits I’ve found from LinkedIn: (1) staying in touch easily - I’m notified instantly whenever a friend in my network changes jobs, and I can search the LinkedIn directory to located co-workers I have lost touch with. (2) making connections that would otherwise be impossible. I have been able to approach large name brand companies about business development because of mutual connections - calling or emailing “cold” from the outside would have been impossible. Being in a network in a sense validates me. , Web User Interface Engineer (Apple), believes LinkedIn fulfills the promise of bridging relationships: I think the value of LinkedIn starts when you want to contact someone you don’t know well enough to just e-mail directly. Let’s say I want to contact you about an exciting opportunity to purchase a bridge. You don’t know me from Adam and you would be understandably skeptical of my offer. However, let’s say a buddy of yours emails you and says, “Hey, I know this guy who’d like to sell you a bridge. He’s a good guy, my friend has known him for years and worked with him at two separate real estate investment companies. I know you’re into collectible bridges, I think you really should talk to this guy.” The real point of LinkedIn is bridging relationships. I want to get in touch with A but I don’t know him, so I contact B who knows A personally and he puts me through to him. That’s the real value of LinkedIn. , Principal Consultant at RABA Technologies, LLC, just expanded his career opportunities. ! I get regular inquiries about jobs through LinkedIn. I don’t think it’s for you to contact the people you know directly. It’s for finding those people that are once or twice removed from you, or for them to find you. I got contacted by a recruiter from Google based on my LinkedIn profile and I start there in 3 weeks. I also was a bit skeptical of LinkedIn at first. When I found out the ways to really use it, however, I discovered that it’s a great way to not only find and get introduced to people through your network for business opportunities, etc., but also a way for the people you DO know to recommend your services which can be viewed by the public. Everytime I meet with a new client or come back from a networking function, I tell them about LinkedIn via email with a brief layman’s overview of what it can do, then follow with an invite to connect. I have received more recommendations this way and also been introduced to several new people who I wouldn’t have gotten the privilege of knowing, had I not been using this service. I’ve already gotten several new leads for possible clients by using this service. The other thing that happens when you get recommendations, is that service you are recommended for is then listed (with your name/etc.), in the LinkedIn Service Provider Directory, which is where people also look, for contractors, professionals, services, etc. , Marketing Manager, probably uses it for all the above reasons: I’ve used Linked-In mainly as a passive way to record a network of business contacts that would only add clutter to my own contact list. In business, I tend to have strong relationships in the office that don’t often extend to my personal life. When those people leave or I move on, Linked-In is an effective tool to keep a connection. I’ve used it to find people to fill positions in my company, to reconnect with former colleagues, to introduce members of different nodes to each other, and to give people a less-intrusive way to re-contact me after a long silence. , About.com Entrepreneur guide & , comments on the three key benefits he derives from using LinkedIn, which includes people search, simplifying data maintenance and keeping in touch with people he's established a professional relationship with.

The sort of work I do runs the gamut from editorial (New York Times, Newsweek, Business Week) to commercial (Sprint, Volkswagen, McDonald's). Aside from the simple thrill that comes with getting paid to draw stuff, I like to think that the rapid concepting and quick execution required in illustration, particularly the editorial variety, keeps my skills sharp and makes me a better visual designer. This strange part-time job of mine makes for some absurd career moments. The friendly-but-heated debate with an art director over the merits of using dinosaurs as a metaphor for obsolescence. Would it be too obvious? Too jokey? Too scary-looking? Bleary-eyed, late-night Google image searches for reference photos of the second actor who played Darren on Bewitched. The weekend call from an advertising agency asking me if I would be willing to air-draw in a darkened room with an assortment of colored flashlights.

Since then we've grown to over 12 million users covering 147 industries, but many of Guy's suggestions on using LinkedIn (see below), still remain a great way for professionals to strengthen their online brand reputation and leverage their professional network. Happy Reading! By adding connections, you increase the likelihood that people will see your profile first when they’re searching for someone to hire or do business with. In addition to appearing at the top of search results  (which is a major plus if you’re one of the 52,000 product managers on LinkedIn), people would much rather work with people who their friends know and trust. Most new users put only their current company in their profile. By doing so, they severely limit their ability to connect with people. You should fill out your profile like it’s an executive bio, so include past companies, education, affiliations, and activities. You can also include a link to your profile as part of an email signature. The added benefit is that the link enables people to see all your credentials, which would be awkward if not downright strange, as an attachment. LinkedIn allows you to make your profile information available for search engines to index. Since LinkedIn profiles receive a fairly high PageRank in Google, this is a good way to influence what people see when they search for you. To do this, create a public profile and select “Full View.” Also, instead of using the default URL, customize your public profile’s URL to be your actual name. To strengthen the visibility of this page in search engines, use this link in various places on the web> For example, when you comment in a blog, include a link to your profile in your signature. In addition to your name, you can also promote your blog or website to search engines like Google and Yahoo! Your LinkedIn profile allows you to publicize websites. There are a few pre-selected categories like “My Website,” “My Company,” etc. If you select “Other” you can modify the name of the link. If you’re linking to your personal blog, include your name or descriptive terms in the link, and voila! instant search-engine optimization for your site. To make this work, be sure your public profile setting is set to “Full View.” LinkedIn’s reference check tool to input a company name and the years the person worked at the company to search for references. Your search will find the people who worked at the company during the same time period. Since references provided by a candidate will generally be glowing, this is a good way to get more balanced data. Companies will typically check your references before hiring you, but have you ever thought of checking your prospective manager’s references? Most interviewees don’t have the audacity to ask a potential boss for references, but with LinkedIn you have a way to scope her out. You can also check up on the company itself by finding the person who used to have the job that you’re interviewing for. Do this by searching for job title and company, but be sure to uncheck “Current titles only.” By contacting people who used to hold the position, you can get the inside scoop on the job, manager and growth potential. By the way, if using LinkedIn in these ways becomes a common practice, we’re apt to see more truthful resumes. There’s nothing more amusing than to find out that the candidate who claims to have caused some huge success was a total bozo who was just along for the ride. Use LinkedIn’s advanced search to find people with educational and work experience like yours to see where they work. For example, a programmer would use search keywords such as “Ruby on Rails,” “C++,” “Python,” “Java,” and “evangelist” to find out where other programmers with these skills work. You can use LinkedIn to find the people that you’re meeting. Knowing that you went to the same school, plays hockey, or shares acquaintances is a lot better than an awkward silence after, “I’m doing fine, thank you.” Perform an advanced search for company name and uncheck the “Current Companies Only” box. This will enable you to scrutinize the rate of turnover and whether key people are abandoning ship. Former employees usually give more candid opinions about a company’s prospects than someone who’s still on board. If you’re thinking of investing or working in a sector, use LinkedIn to find people who worked for competitors—or even better, companies who failed. For example, suppose you wanted to build a next generation online pet store, you’d probably learn a lot from speaking with former Pets.com or WebVan employees. You can see people in your network who are initiating new startups by doing an advanced search for a range of keywords such as “stealth” or “new startup.” Apply the “Sort By” filter to “Degrees away from you” in order to see the people closest to you first.

The travel part involved flying from San Francisco to Ushuaia, Argentina, then traveling by ship the rest of the way to Antarctica. After 30 hours and 5 layovers I arrived in Ushuaia, Tierra Del Fuego Argentina; the southern most tip of South America. From there I boarded a ship bound for Antarctica and spent 2 days crossing the Drake Passage where 30 to 40 foot waves are common and 60 foot waves are not unheard of. Fortunately we only experienced the 30 to 40 foot swells but even still, the ship doctor told me about 90% of the passengers got sea sick. For breakfast the first morning at sea they served us Monte Cristo sandwiches (ham, turkey and Swiss cheese between two slices of bread, soaked in egg-based batter and deep-fried). Man, did the crew have a wicked sense of humor! Once we reached the coast of Antarctica the seas were mostly calm to everyone’s relief. We spent the next few weeks traveling along the western coast of the Antarctic peninsula, taking Zodiac (those rubber navy seal boats) trips to various landing spots during the day visiting penguin colonies, glaciers, a few research stations (the researchers were quite surprised to see us) and an abandoned whaling site. In the evening the tour staff (mostly Antarctic researchers / grad students) gave talks about Antarctic ecology, geology, geography, history etc. so we were able to learn a great deal about our surrounding environment. During these two weeks we saw an amazing abundance of wildlife including Penguins (Adele, Gentoo, King, Chinstrap and Magellanic), seals, whales (sperm, humpback, Minke) and different species of birds, too numerous to count. On the last day before heading back into the Drake Passage we dropped anchor along a small island to allow a few hearty fools, I mean, souls to take a swim and become members of the Antarctic Polar Plunge Club. I had already become a member of the Polar Bear Club in Prudhoe Bay Alaska a few years back and wasn’t about to let this opportunity slip by. They simply dropped the gang plank, tied a rope around my waist and pointed towards the water, so I jumped in… and very quickly scrambled back to the ship to get yanked out. It was just a little cold (34, 35 degrees Fahrenheit maybe). As I walked up the plank, the ship doctor handed me literally a glass full of vodka. The ship doctor!

This becomes incredibly powerful when you combine it with .  For example, if I am looking for a good Java engineer, I might split each term into several possible words: (Java J2EE JSP) (Engineer Architect Lead) Note the use of parentheses to group the OR terms together, so the AND will apply correctly to any of the words in each group of terms.

The coverage on outlines the genesis of LinkedIn through the history of our co-founder Reid Hoffman's usage of LinkedIn and concludes with the user experience of (SVP, Sr. Director at BBDO). Here's the rest of the article (By JOE BEL BRUNO, AP Business Writer and photo by Douglas C. Pizac, AP): An increasing number of professionals are tapping into a new breed of networking Web sites to do more than just boast about how many \"friends\" they have. Millions of users each day are using the Internet to compare investment techniques, correspond with job recruiters and find help in launching a business. Now, sites are also being designed specifically with professionals in mind. LinkedIn, a  business-contact networking site, has seen its ranks swell to 12 million in just four years. \"The whole MySpace culture just passed me by, and there's a whole generation of people that feel the same,\" said Matana LePlae, 36, an advertising executive and mother of two daughters. Then the New York City resident was invited by a colleague to join LinkedIn. \"For my kids, these networking Web sites will be part of their lives,\" she said. \"I didn't think it would be part of mine.\" In the past, Web sites like Monster.com and message boards were simply a space where members could post a resume or a stock tip and hope someone stumbled upon it. LinkedIn, and other business networking Web sites, allow for more relevant contacts and more private communications. They allow business people to share their network of contacts with others and share their contacts in return. And that's exactly what Reid Hoffman envisioned when he and four others launched LinkedIn in 2003. The ad-driven Web site is now growing by about 700,000 new users each month, and is considered to be the model for a growing trend of business-oriented networking sites. Management said the privately-owned company is profitable, and revenue has doubled year-to-date. The 1,294 contacts on Hoffman's LinkedIn profile read like a who's who of Silicon Valley elite -- everyone from Internet executives to venture capitalists. Users on the site who know Hoffman, or become one of his contacts, would have access to those names -- and vice versa. On LinkedIn, members have to accept contacts -- and unlock their lists to others they have approved. \"At this point, if you come in and upload your address book and connect with people that are here, it doesn't take much experimenting,\" he said. \"You can be off to the races immediately, and that's one of the benefits of being at a scale of 12 million people.\" Trade associations have long used the Internet to connect members within a particular industry. However, sites using social networking software allow them to post details on a profile, and use it to directly communicate and access information. \"For many people, these sites will mirror the way we behave off-line,\" said Steven Jones, a professor at the University of Illinois, Chicago who specializes in new media.

So at this point, I have a few opinions of my own. Here’s my advice: LinkedIn works best as a way to leverage your professional circle of people you know well or know their work well. I love looking through my friends’ professional networks to get an idea of what introductions I could possibly get from a friend. My friend can say to her friend, “This is Penelope, you should get to know her because of x.” But this only works if my friend actually knows me and the other person well. Otherwise, I may as well make the introduction myself. In that respect, your network on LinkedIn is really only as strong as your ties to the people in it. You will get more benefits from LinkedIn if you have a network of 30 people you know well than 300 people you don’t really know. I feel like I kinda know . I know I’d like to have dinner with him (does he ever stop blogging to have dinner?) I read his blog every day, and I know the type of connections he could offer me. But he doesn’t know me. Even if I have emailed him three times and posted ten comments on his blog, he doesn’t know who I am. He probably reads 400 emails and comments a day. When you appear in other peoples’ lists, if someone wants to connect with you, they have to go through your mutual connection, or they can email you directly. There is a reason LinkedIn works this way - the point is not to connect with everyone, it’s to connect with people you know. Someone who puts their email address right under their name is announcing that they will connect with anyone, and for the purposes of LinkedIn, this will weaken their network. I get a lot of invitations that say, “Sorry for the form letter” but you’ll have to trust me that the most well connected, high-level, experienced people I know send the form letter. It’s fine. Also, people send invitations to me that say something like, “Okay, I’m doing the LinkedIn thing.” But it makes you look bad to invite someone to something you feel uncomfortable with, so if you can’t think of something good to write, just send one of the form letters. Sometimes, I do actually know someone, but I communicate with so many different people every day, that I don’t remember. Yesterday I got an invitation that said, “It was great to do the podcast interview with you today” right before the standard LinkedIn invitation text. That was great. I knew exactly who the woman was and I connected. This also brings up another point, which is act immediately. The best invitations come right after you’ve made one, solid connection with a given person. For example, if you go back and forth in email six times, send an invitation that day. Journalists, for example, will be harder to connect with. They are notoriously adept at telling people they have no time to talk. Also, journalists already have good access to a wide range of people. However a journalist will be happy to connect to, say, the managing editor of the New York Times. Know who you’re dealing with and where you fit in and then you’ll understand how well you need to know the person in order to connect. (Note: Here are .) LinkedIn is a group of people coming together to help each other. More cocktail party than job interview. So, for example, make your resume a little chatty. are a little more casual than a formal resume. I think I could actually fix mine up a bit in this regard. When I read a resume on LinkedIn, I am not scanning to see if I want to hire the person (which is the purpose of the formal resume format). Instead, I would like a sort of cocktail-party introduction about the person and what they are doing with their life. Don’t write paragraphs in your resume, but a short paragraph on LinkedIn is sort of nice."},{"post_categories":["LinkedIn Tips"],"author":"Adam Nash","title":"LinkedIn Users: Dr. Sharon Nash, Ph.D.","date":"July 10, 2007","content":"I always think of myself as a pro-connection type of person.After all, as a psychologist, I spend my day helping people connect with others in a healthy way. I have always valued my own connections and have gone to great lengths to stay in touch with friends from every phase of my life (in fact, I met my husband at the Bronx HS of Science 44 years ago). I have a group of 7 friends (my \"birthday club\") that I have invited for dinner every July for the last 17 years. I belong to three psychotherapy consultations groups, the longest-standing of which has been together for 15 years. You could say that I'm a relationship junkie. I joined LinkedIn on June 1st, 2007 at the invitation of my son, Adam, who had signed up 4 years before he started working there in May. He is a great proselytizer and believer in the product; nevertheless, I was skeptical at first.It wasn't quite clear to me what value being LinkedIn would be to a non-techie type who was happily self-employed. During Adam's previous 4 years at eBay, he even launched eBay Express for people like me who were intimidated by the vigilance demanded by an active auction site.  Still, I am ashamed to admit, I never had the courage to give eBay a try. LinkedIn is different.Once invited, it became very easy (and very seductive) to make my links to friends and colleagues \"official.\" It hasn't always been an easy sell for my cohort, whose technological skills are challenged by the demands of email. As my best friend in high school just replied to my invitation, \"why would I want to get LinkedIn to you, when I can just email you?\" The psychologist in me has been fascinated with the responses I have gotten to my invitations to LinkedIn.It's like a projective Rorschach Test of friends' personalities.There are the loyalists who enthusiastically respond, \"I'm not sure what it is, but if it means I'm linked to you, I'm joining!\".Then there are the skeptics and the Luddites who are afraid that connecting will involve an intolerable level of self-disclosure and fear of unwanted solicitation.Most of my friends are unaware, but open-minded enough to welcome articles on LinkedIn so they can understand what it all about. Adam has teased me that of the 83 connections I have to date, I may have the highest percentage of people with only one link--me!The reality is, once you're LinkedIn, the site begins to sell itself.As one friendsaid in an email titled \"New Addiction\": I am spending so much time on LinkedIn now, it's not funny. I figured out what it is: it's My Space for working people.The truth is, I guessI was looking for something to do to avoid dealing with [my son's] Bar Mitzvah. When I was working, I had that to fill my time, now I need something else, so I busy myself trying to build connections so I don't look like a Link Loser. Another friend who is a journalist noted: Adults like me don't spend as much time as my kids do on Facebook-like online activities. But maybe that was before LinkedIn . . . Boy, did I feel like someone in the know when I read Michelle Slatella's column [New York Times Thursday Style] last night and saw the mention of LinkedIn. \"I know what that is!\" I said to [my daughter] Molly . . . I'm at LinkedIn. Thanks for keeping me current, Sharon. I must admit, I am thoroughly enjoying perusing my links daily. It is particularly interesting to learn things about the background and experience of friends and family. It has been a kick to track classmates from college and graduate school, fellow therapists and clinical faculty. I check their links, although I am still timid about asking them to forward invitations to their friends and colleagues. As a means of staying connected and current with those I know and respect, it's been a fun ride. I do confess, there is that temptation to keep setting the LinkedIn bar a bit higher.

I thought this would be a good way to continue the conversation right here on the LinkedIn blog and address the five tips he recommends Given below are Chris' five tips with a LinkedIn take on them: Seems like a no-brainer, but spending time to build your profile 100% is an essential step forward in helping you take control of your professional brand. Don't forget that LinkedIn Public profiles tend to get indexed on all major search engines. So, when opportunity knocks and a manager or prospective employer finds your profile through a search, it's always good to have the most accurate, up-to-date and impressive stats from your career displayed.  A LinkedIn profile not only defines your professional identity on the web, but also helps differentiate and position your unique personal brand. A LinkedIn public profile is the easiest way to define your unique skill sets and so it's worth spending time on crafting a unique LinkedIn profile. A suitable start would be updating the following three profile categories with relevant information (example provided): * Profile Summary -- My personal mantra is \"empower entrepreneurs.\" When all is said and done, I'm a marketing guy. I established my professional reputation as a software evangelist at  Apple back in the 80s.

It'd also be a great way to reconnect with those coworkers you'd always wanted to stay in touch with. Whether you're a consultant or someone looking for a job, users would rather connect with or hire an expert. A great way to establish credibility in any given field would be to answer questions in categories that you're passionate about. What's interesting is that this is also a great reason for your peers to recommend you since it validates their recommendation. The feature also allows you, as Chris says, to get in front of your peers and colleagues you've always wanted to connect with but haven't had a chance to do so until now. As enticing as it is to publish your email address in the Name field, we've received numerous complaints of abuse in the past ranging from spam to harassment. As stated in our (under user conduct), we believe in protecting sensitive information shared by over 12 million users and posting content in fields that aren't intended for that content would be a violation of that trust. The best way for someone to reach you would be through the power of mutual connections. So, if you'd like to connect with , find someone we both know who can recommend you and ask them to introduce you to me. And, don't forget to recommend that friend of yours who made that introduction! One of the prolific bloggers at productivity blog ; here's how Chris practices what he preaches: --- 1.

Check out a sampling below: * (Director, Marketing Practice at Quantum Leaders): Internally, firms can and are better leveraging their internal resources by providing them the tools and contexts to collaborate more powerfully. This is a particular challenge in larger firms where they may have tremendous knowledge resources that are not being leveraged to the fullest. Externally, some firms (in both the B-to-B and B-to-C environments) are leveraging social network as an innovation process that helps them bring better products and services to a market interested in buying them. * (Director, Web Services at Library of Congress): I think the impact will be huge. I think there is a huge shift in how people seek, access, and interact with information and communities. I think business and government are going to need to change their approaches and interactions. I also think they how business promote their products, services, and thier companies will continue to change as the web moves from the traditional passive experience to one that is more active and relationship based. ...and some questions just lead to other interesting questions: * (Vice-President, Pen Group Communications) Businesses will take social media increasingly seriously over the next five years, but where they insert it into their communications strategies is the question. Does it fall under the purvey of the marketers? i.e. is it more properly a 'direct marketing' exercise, because an increasing amount of this media will be consumer-generated? Or, because it is 'media' is it still to be tasked to the corporate communications and public relations specialists to be sorted out? And, will this be the case as social media consolidation and merging with other, more traditional platforms continues?  The genesis for Shel's question is a global survey that he is conducting on behalf of one of his clients. Shel has also asked the same question within the blogosphere and continues to collate answers with each passing day.

As many of you know, LinkedIn continues to provide value to consultants in different industry segments by helping them accomplish two of their most pressing needs: (1) Winning new business (2) Strengthening existing business So, let's see what are the ways in which LinkedIn can help facilitate the above two goals and also some immediate steps you can follow, to effect some results. Here are 5 ways that LinkedIn can help consultants win and strengthen their business relationships Potential clients find you when your LinkedIn profile matches a keyword they use for their search. With per month, odds are someone has already searched LinkedIn for a person with your expertise. Include the right keywords in your profile, so you show up in the search results of potential clients. LinkedIn not only allows you to find hiring managers in your industry and region, but also enables you to identify new prospects in the networks of your former clients or colleagues. The most valuable information for your clients is rarely on a Web page: it is usually in the minds of influencers and potential customers. LinkedIn helps you find these people and reach them through introductions made by your trusted contacts. Most consultants get the majority of their clients through word-of-mouth referrals. When you connect on LinkedIn with professionals who have referred business to you in the past, you strengthen your relationship with them by helping them reach people you know. Also, once connected on LinkedIn, you can see who they or their contacts know and proactively reach out to potential new clients via referrals from past clients or former co-workers. If you have more business than you can handle, you can also use LinkedIn to find qualified staff and subcontractors. One of the first steps in establishing your reputation within LinkedIn is by your former clients and colleagues whom you've impressed with your work ethic. This not only offers examples of consulting work you've done in the past on your LinkedIn profile, but may seem mandatory given the competitive consulting environment in different fields today. Also, don't forget to recommend your co-workers (past and present) and fellow consultants whose work you admire. Another effective way to substantiate your expertise in a given field is offering solutions and answers to specific questions being posed by your trusted network through .

Over $11 million dollars were raised by the riders to benefit The San Francisco AIDS Foundation and the LA Gay and Lesbian Center. It happened somewhere between Rest Stop One and Lunch. We left King City on a cool foggy morning and the headwinds were well above 10 miles per hour. Just after Rest Stop One we faced the hill of all hills, \"Quadbuster\"! Everyone was preparing to face the beast and all I could do, with butterflies in my stomach, was to eat a Cliff bar and go! And there she was, the mother of all steep climes for beginner bikers straight ahead. In preparation, I shot down to my granny gear and picked a song to sing in my head. \"Don't stop believing\" by Journey.

The next thing I saw were their faces next to all of us, upstream hikers that were attacking the hill. Pedaling alongside of us to make sure we all make it to the top.

Nationally, 70 percent of all new infections occurs in communities of color and people under the age of 25 are increasingly affected. The costs associated, with medical care and treatment for a person with HIV, are about $20,000 per year. Access to life-saving drugs, clinical trials and state-of-the-art treatment helps those with the disease live a longer and better quality of life. My colleague, Brittany, and I are hoping that to raise awareness both by fund raising and participation in a week long cycling event - . Over the course of seven days, we will travel five hundred and fifty six miles from San Francisco to Los Angeles.  We will become part of a traveling community representing thousands of people who cannot ride with us.  Each participant signs up and commits to a specific minimum donation to contribute to the federation of foundations sponsoring the rides. AIDS/LifeCycle helps those living with HIV/AIDS gain greater independence and get the treatment and care they need. Prevention services geared towards high-risk populations, will ensure that future generations need not experience the same level of loss that we have faced in the last two decades. We have been training for about 6 months and our longest ride in one day has been between 80 and 90 miles with plenty of recovery time. In the next week we will be riding up to 100 miles in a day, resting in the evenings before starting the next day’s long ride with only the prior evening's recovery time.
